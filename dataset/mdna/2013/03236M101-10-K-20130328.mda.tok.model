part i item business overview amyris is a renewable products company focused on providing sustainable alternatives to a broad range of petroleum sourced products 
we developed innovative microbial engineering and screening technologies that modify the way microorganisms process sugars 
we are using our proprietary synthetic biology platform to design microbes  primarily yeast  and use them as living factories in established fermentation processes to convert plant sourced sugars into renewable hydrocarbons 
we are developing  and  in some cases  already commercializing  products from these hydrocarbons in several target markets  including cosmetics  lubricants  flavors and fragrances  polymers and plastic additives  home and personal care products  and transportation fuels 
we call these no compromise products because we design them to perform comparably to  or better than  currently available products 
we were founded in in the san francisco bay area by a group of scientists from the university of california  berkeley 
our first major milestone came in when  through a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation  our scientists developed technology capable of creating microbial strains to produce artemisinic acid a precursor of artemisinin  an effective anti malarial drug 
in  we granted a royalty free license to this technology to sanofi aventis  which currently expects to begin distributing artemisinin based anti malarial drugs made through our technology in building on our success with semi synthetic artemisinin to combat malaria  amyris has been applying its industrial synthetic biology platform to provide alternatives to a broad range of petroleum sourced products 
amyris has focused its development efforts on the production of biofene  amyris brand of renewable farnesene  a long chain  branched liquid hydrocarbon molecule 
using biofene as a building block molecule  we are developing a wide range of renewable products for our target markets 
while our platform is able to utilize a wide variety of feedstocks  we are focusing our large scale production plans primarily on the use of brazilian sugarcane as our feedstock because of its abundance  low cost and relative price stability 
by locating our production facilities in brazil  we are leveraging a mature sugarcane growing and fermentation infrastructure  reducing our production costs  and accessing feedstock that is somewhat insulated from price volatility 
we have also produced biofene from other feedstocks such as sugar beets  corn dextrose  sweet sorghum and cellulosic sugars 
amyris first purpose built  large scale biofene production plant commenced operations in southeastern brazil in december this plant is in brotas in the state of s o paulo and is adjacent to an existing sugar and ethanol mill  para so bioenergia 
amyris has also advanced initial construction of a second large scale production plant in brazil  located at the usina s o martinho sugar and ethanol mill also in the state of s o paulo  which we intend to complete when production economics support start up of that plant 
to satisfy initial demand for our products until our own facilities are operating  we have leveraged contract manufacturing capabilities of established companies 
our business strategy is to focus our direct commercialization efforts on higher value  lower volume markets while moving lower margin  higher volume commodity products  including our fuels and base oil lubricants products  into joint venture arrangements with established industry leaders 
we believe this approach will permit access to the capital and resources necessary to support large scale production and global distribution for our large market commodity products 
amyris is focused on building its renewable product leadership position initially with squalane in cosmetics  niche fuel opportunities  fragrance oils  and farnesene for liquid polymers applications 
we believe that success in these early markets will pave the way to accessing larger markets and having a more significant impact in the longer term 
we were incorporated in we have two operating subsidiaries  amyris brasil ltda 
formerly amyris brasil sa  or amyris brasil  and amyris fuels llc  or amyris fuels 
amyris brasil oversees the establishment and expansion of our production in brazil 
amyris fuels was originally established to help us develop fuel distribution capabilities in the us we began selling fuels through amyris fuels in june amyris fuels generated revenue from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline to wholesale customers through a network of terminals in the eastern us we completed our planned transition out of the ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline business in the third quarter of in  we generated million in revenues  including million from sales of ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline by amyris fuels  million from grants and collaborations  and million from product sales of our renewable products 
our business strategy petroleum is a fundamental building block for many products  such as consumer products  chemicals  plastics and transportation fuels that are essential to modern economies 
recently  the increased demand for petroleum in the face of limited supply  supply chain uncertainties and negative environmental impacts have created challenges to the current petroleum infrastructure 
as a result  there have been many attempts to create products comparable to petroleum derivatives without these drawbacks 
however  initial approaches have faced a number of challenges that have limited their success  including exposure to volatile feedstock pricing  questionable environmental sustainability  limited product portfolio  and dependency on government policy 
our objective is to become the leading provider of renewable  high performance alternatives to selected petroleum sourced chemicals and fuels 
by leveraging our synthetic biology platform  our partners know how  and our experience in industrial fermentation  our products are designed to enable our customers to reduce the environmental impact of their products without compromising performance  and  in some cases  our renewable products provide superior performance to the petroleum sourced products they are replacing 
key elements of our strategy include leveraging our technology platform to improve efficiency 
we continue applying synthetic biology  primarily our strain engineering platform  to lower the cost of production of our products through improvements in yields and other production process efficiencies 
we do this with our industrial platform for yeast strain development at our world class laboratories 
we also support scale up to commercial production in two pilot plant facilities and a demonstration production facility  as well as at various contract manufacturing locations 
accelerating development through collaborations 
in order to accelerate the development of new technologies  production methods or products  we enter into collaborative research  development and commercialization agreements  such as our existing agreements with total gas power usa sas  or total  firmenich sa  or firmenich  givaudan schweiz ag  or givaudan  cosan ind stria e com rcio sa  or cosan  kuraray co  ltd  or kuraray  m g finanziaria srl  or m g  method home products  inc  or method  and manufacture francaise de pneumatiques michelin  or michelin 
we have also entered into partnerships with the us government to develop certain technologies and processes capable of improving our ability of producing alternatives to petroleum sourced products 
delivering cost efficient manufacturing 
building on our breakthrough technology and experience gained from production through third party contract manufacturing  we built  commissioned and are now operating our own large scale biofene production plant in brotas  in the state of s o paulo  brazil 
we opted to focus on brazilian sugarcane as the feedstock to support our production ramp because of its abundance  low cost and relative price stability 
as we develop cost efficient manufacturing in our first production facility  we expect to seek to work selectively with other brazilian sugar and ethanol producers to build additional facilities adjacent to their existing mills  thereby reducing the capital required to establish and scale our production operations 
targeting product markets to maximize returns 
we have begun to commercialize our products derived from biofene primarily in select specialty chemical markets characterized by higher margin  lower volume products  where we believe we can earn positive gross margins with current production process efficiencies 
for example  in we initiated sales of a cosmetic emollient  squalane  produced from biofene 
we have also established sales channels to certain niche diesel markets in metropolitan bus fleets in brazil 
as we lower our production costs through technological and manufacturing improvements  we intend to expand into broader  lower margin  higher volume commodity product markets  such as the broad based fuels market and base oil lubricants markets  through joint venture arrangements 
our breakthrough technology our synthetic biology platform enables us to modify the genetic pathways of microorganisms  primarily yeast  to turn them into living factories to produce target molecules for which we believe there may be significant market opportunities 
in addition to using our synthetic biology platform to identify and improve strains of microbes to produce target molecules  we are using our technology platform to develop production processes that we believe will allow us to scale to commercial levels 
the primary biological pathway within the microbe that we currently use to produce our target molecules is the isoprenoid pathway 
isoprenoids constitute a large  diverse class of organic chemicals with current product applications in a wide range of industries  including specialty chemicals and fuels 
with this pathway  we can potentially produce thousands of different isoprenoid molecules 
the key steps in our strain engineering and scale up process have been as follows identifying target molecules 
we start our process by identifying a commercial application where we can deliver a no compromise solution that we want to pursue 
we identify the key molecular properties that are essential to product performance in a specific commercial application and then analyze the chemical structures that drive those key performance characteristics 
finally  we identify target molecules or derivatives of molecules that are comprised of these key chemical structures and that may be produced by our yeast strains 
developing initial strains 
once we have chosen a target molecule  we identify the steps required for its production in a biological pathway 
we then seek to design a pathway to produce the target  either directly or by producing a molecule that can  through simple chemical steps  be synthesized  or converted  into the target 
once this pathway is identified  we undertake to engineer it into our yeast strains by employing the processes discussed below 
improving strain performance and process development 
after we have established a pathway and verified that it can produce the target molecule  the yeast strain must be improved to increase the level of efficiency of production 
initially  we focus primarily on yield  a measure of the amount of product produced by a defined amount of sugar as the means to improve strain output 
as we advance in our scale up and commercial scale process development  we also seek to improve production output through improvements in strain productivity  the rate at which our product is produced by a given yeast strain  and titer  the concentration of product in the fermentation broth 
in addition  we seek to develop processes to improve production recovery efficiency  including separation efficiency  which is the amount of product that is captured from a fermentation run  cycle time  which is the time needed to run a full fermentation cycle  and the evolution of batch process methods to semi continuous and continuous production methods 
moving production from lab to commercial scale 
once we have established a pathway and verified that it can produce the target molecule  the yeast strain must be improved to increase the level of efficiency of production 
we design our lab scale two liter fermenters to mimic the conditions found in larger scale fermentation so that our findings may translate predictably from lab scale to pilot  demonstration and commercial scale 
in addition to our lab scale fermenters  we have operating pilot plants in our facilities in emeryville  california and campinas  brazil  as well as two  liter fermenters in our campinas demonstration facility 
to date  most of our efforts have focused on developing yeast strains to produce biofene and  to a lesser extent  flavors and fragrances  with significant development efforts devoted to chemical synthesis of other products from biofene 
though our technology platform allows us to develop yeast strains engineered to produce other target molecules  we expect to continue focusing most of our strain engineering efforts on biofene production and  to a lesser extent  selected specialty chemical ingredients  for the foreseeable future 
our industrial production our industrial production operations generally involve two major steps 
first  we produce a target molecule by means of an industrial fermentation process 
in some cases this target molecule is itself the desired end product 
in other cases  it must be converted into the desired end product by a second step where we use chemical synthesis of the initial target molecule to produce a final target molecule 
commercial production of target fermentation molecules we have initiated commercial production of biofene  our initial fermentation molecule  at our purpose built  large scale biofene production plant in brotas  in the state of s o paulo  brazil 
our biofene production plant in brotas is adjacent to an existing sugar and ethanol mill  para so bioenergia 
under our agreement with para so bioenergia sa  or para so bioenergia  they will supply sugarcane juice and other utilities and we were responsible for construction which commenced in august and operation of our biofene production facility 
our biofene production plant has six  liter production fermenters and was designed to process sugarcane juice  or its equivalent  from up to one million tons of raw sugarcane annually 
in december  following a successful commissioning phase  we began production of biofene at the facility 
our first shipment of biofene produced at the facility occurred on february  prior to operating our own facility  we relied on multiple contract manufacturing facilities in the us  brazil and spain  which used  to  liter fermenters and multiple kinds of feedstock 
we have also advanced initial construction of a second large scale production plant in brazil  located at the usina s o martinho sugar and ethanol mill also in the state of s o paulo  which we intend to complete when production economics support start up of that plant 
we entered into agreements with usina s o martinho sa  or usina s o martinho  a subsidiary of s o martinho sa  to establish the facility at usina s o martinho  and the plant is being built by a joint venture sma ind stria qu mica sa  or sma 
we formed sma in  and commenced site preparation in december and civil construction in february in early  we suspended construction at sma pending completion and operation of our brotas facility 
the sma plant is intended to provide a large scale production facility to support our longer term production plans 
following the completion of our sma plant  we expect to seek to expand our large scale production capacity of intermediate molecules by entering into agreements with owners of additional sugar and ethanol mills in brazil 
chemical finishing process in some cases  we perform additional chemical finishing steps to convert initial target molecules into other finished products  such as renewable squalane  lubricants  polymers and diesel 
we have established an agreement with glycotech inc  or glycotech  for use of the leland  north carolina facility of salisbury partners  llc to convert biofene into squalane and other final products 
we expect to enter into additional agreements with other chemical companies for finishing services to access flexible capacity and an array of services as we develop additional products 
our products we are focused on developing a broad range of products to address six identified markets cosmetics  lubricants  flavors and fragrances  polymers  consumer products and transportation fuels 
cosmetics through simple chemical finishing steps  we are able to convert biofene into squalane 
squalane is used today as a moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics and other personal care products 
squalane traditionally has been manufactured from olive oil or extracted from shark liver oil 
we believe amyris produced squalane offers a purity that is equal or superior to squalane derived from conventional sources 
the relatively high price of squalane to date has meant that its use has been limited to small quantities in mass market product formulations or to use in luxury products 
we believe that we are capable of producing squalane at a price that would permit formulators to use squalane more broadly 
to initially market and distribute squalane  we established a relationship with soliance  a leading distributor of renewable cosmetics ingredients based in the champagne ardenne region in france 
we also have agreements with nikko chemicals co 
ltd  or nikko  a distributor in japan  and centerchem  inc  or centerchem  a distributor in north america 
we anticipate identifying additional distributors in lubricants base oils are the building blocks of lubricating oils and are currently derived from the crude oil refining process 
additives are materials added to base oils to change their properties  characteristics  or performance eg  anti foam  anti wear  corrosion inhibitor  detergent  dispersant  pour point depressant  anti oxidant  or friction modifier 
lubricants are manufactured by combining a base oil with additives required by lubricant product applications  including engine oils  gear oils  hydraulic oils and turbine oils 
biofene may be chemically modified to serve as a base oil  additive  and or lubricant 
we believe the high purity  synthetic base oil and additive molecules that can be made from biofene could enable lubricant products to perform in harsh environments under extremes of temperature  moisture  dirt and wear 
in december  we entered into an agreement with cosan and its affiliates to establish a joint venture for the worldwide development  production and commercialization of renewable base oils for the automotive  industrial and commercial lubricants markets 
in march  we expanded this collaboration to also include additives and lubricants for the automotive  industrial and commercial lubricants markets 
the joint venture is operated through novvi llc 
we anticipate that novvi llc will source biofene for its products initially from amyris production facilities  and amyris and cosan  as co owners of novvi llc  would share its development  marketing and operating costs 
flavors and fragrances we believe we are well situated to cost effectively and sustainably produce natural oils and aroma chemicals that are commonly used in the flavors and fragrances market 
many of the natural ingredients used in flavors and fragrances market are expensive because there is limited supply and the synthetic alternatives require complex chemical conversions 
amyris intends to offer flavors and fragrances companies a natural route to procure these ingredients without sacrificing cost or quality 
currently  we are working with partners to develop a variety of flavors and fragrances ingredients that are either direct fermentation target molecules or derivatives of fermentation target molecules 
we plan to participate in the flavors and fragrance market by providing sustainable replacements that are high quality  reliably available  and competitively priced 
to begin to develop our product offerings in this area  we have established the following partnerships a collaboration and joint development arrangement with firmenich  a global flavors and fragrances company headquartered in geneva  switzerland 
under a march master collaboration agreement which superseded prior arrangements with firmenich  we will research and develop flavors and fragrances compounds and grant firmenich exclusive access to such compounds in exchange for research and development funding and a profit sharing arrangement 
the new agreement superseded and expanded a prior collaboration agreement with firmenich for joint development and commercialization of specific ingredients within the flavors and fragrances field 
a co development agreement with givaudan  a global flavors and fragrance company headquartered in vernier  switzerland 
under the agreement  we will develop a derivative of biofene to be used as a building block for one of the proprietary fragrance ingredients in givaudan portfolio 
under the agreement  upon achievement of certain success criteria  we would supply biofene to givaudan to derive the proprietary ingredient for the global fragrances and flavors market and share in the economic value created from the use of biofene 
polymers and plastic additives synthetic polymers are commonly used in the manufacture of thousands of products that incorporate plastics and other polymeric materials  and we believe biofene has the potential to provide significant opportunities for development of renewable products for the polymer market 
in july  we entered into a collaboration agreement with kuraray to develop polymers from biofene 
under the agreement  kuraray will use biofene to replace petroleum derived molecules such as butadiene and isoprene in the production of specified classes of high performing polymers 
upon successful completion of the technical development program for the first polymer  amyris and kuraray would enter into a supply agreement for kuraray exclusive use of biofene in the manufacturing and commercialization of these polymer products 
home personal care products biofene also offers a platform for development of sustainable  high performing and cost competitive ingredients for the fabric and home care such as detergents  fabric softener  dish soap  and household cleaning products and the personal care such as hair care and body care markets 
we have entered into some evaluation and collaboration agreements with certain producers of home and personal care products to explore opportunities in these markets 
transportation fuels we have selected diesel as our primary area of focus within the transportation fuels market because of its projected global demand growth  the lack of a scalable  competitive renewable product  and our belief that our fuel product has properties superior to those of existing renewable alternatives 
in general  we will produce our renewable diesel by the simple chemical step of hydrogenating our biofene 
hydrogenation is a common chemical process currently used in the production of numerous products  such as saturation of vegetable oils to make margarine 
in july  we entered into an agreement with petrobras distribuidora sa  or petrobras  to sell diesel derived from biofene to petrobras to blend with fuel supplied and distributed by petrobras to city bus fleets of s o paulo and rio de janeiro  brazil 
in november and july  we entered into amendments of our technology license  development  research and collaboration agreement with total to establish a renewable diesel development program as described in more detail below under total collaboration products 
we have completed significant steps to validate our ability to produce a market accepted diesel product 
by design  our product is a hydrocarbon of similar size to many of the hydrocarbons in petroleum sourced diesel fuel 
due to the similarity of its chemical composition to that of existing petroleum sourced diesel  our product has the properties required of diesel fuel and thereby satisfies the astm d table specifications for petroleum derived diesel fuel oils 
the environmental protection agency  or epa  has registered our diesel for use as a blend with petroleum diesel in highway vehicles and non road equipment and we are working to obtain registration for a higher blend with petroleum diesel  as opposed to the typical blend of other bio diesel products with petroleum diesel 
we have received required approvals with brazilian anp ag ncia nacional do petr leo  gas natural e biocombust veis for specific uses of our fuel in the country  and are pursuing diesel fuel registration with the carb california air resources board and other relevant regulatory bodies 
our ability to enter the diesel market is also dependent upon our ability to continue to achieve the required regulatory approvals in the global markets in which we will seek to sell our diesel products 
these approvals primarily involve clearance by the relevant environmental agencies in the particular jurisdiction 
we must also be certified by a sufficient number of diesel engine manufacturers  vehicle manufacturers or operators of large trucking fleets so that our diesel will have an appropriately large and accessible addressable market 
these certification processes include fuel analysis modeling and the testing of engines and their components to ensure that the use of our diesel fuel does not degrade performance or reduce the lifecycle of the engine or cause it to fail to meet emissions standards 
we have completed successful engine testing of our diesel fuel with cummins engine company  or cummins  and mercedes benz brasil at a blend of up to  and our renewable diesel has received oem engine warranties from cummins  volkswagen ag and mercedes benz brasil for demonstration purposes 
we continue to work with other diesel engine manufacturers to qualify our product for use in their engines 
total collaboration products we have a license  development  research and collaboration agreement with total that sets forth the terms for the research  development  production and commercialization of chemical and or fuels products to be agreed on by the parties 
the agreement establishes a multi phased process through which compounds are identified  screened  selected for product feasibility study  and then ultimately selected as a lead compound for development 
to commercialize any strains and compounds that are developed  amyris and total expect to form one or more joint ventures  the first of which we expect will be the fuels joint venture described below 
both amyris and total retain certain rights to make covered products independently subject to making royalty payments to the non producing party  and total has certain rights to require amyris to work on non collaboration projects 
we have retained rights to produce and commercialize products in the following markets flavors and fragrances  cosmetics  pharmaceuticals  consumer packaged goods  food additives  and pesticides 
the first programs we are focusing on with total relate to renewable diesel and jet fuel and industrial lubricants  however  we and total retain the right to propose product development programs under these agreements in the future 
in november  we entered into an amendment of the collaboration agreement with total with respect to development and commercialization of biofene for diesel 
this represented an expansion of the initial collaboration that the parties established in  and established a global  exclusive collaboration for the development of biofene for diesel and a framework for the creation of a joint venture to manufacture and commercialize biofene for diesel 
in addition  a limited number of other potential products were subject to development for the joint venture on a non exclusive basis 
in july  we entered into a further amendment of the collaboration agreement with total that expanded total investment in the biofene collaboration  incorporated the development of certain joint venture products for use in diesel and jet fuel into the scope of the collaboration  and changed the structure of the funding from total to include a convertible debt mechanism 
product distribution and sales we intend to distribute and sell our products either directly  through joint ventures  or with partners  depending on the market 
for most chemical applications  we intend to sell directly to specialty chemical and consumer products companies 
for example  we would expect to sell directly to firmenich  givaudan  kuraray  m g  method and michelin under our agreements with them 
generally  our collaboration agreements such as these do not include any specific purchase obligations  and sales are contingent upon achievement of technical and commercial milestones 
in addition  we expect to commercialize certain products  including fuels and base oils through joint venture arrangements with total and cosan  respectively 
commencing in  we began developing a fuels distribution network and distribution capabilities in the us through amyris fuels 
through mid  we purchased ethanol produced by third parties and gasoline and sold both pure ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline to wholesale customers 
for  mansfield oil company accounted for more than of our reported revenues by virtue of its purchases of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline from amyris fuels 
collaboration revenues from total also accounted for more than of our reported revenues in customers purchased ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline from us under short term agreements and spot transactions  and we generally did not have any contractual commitments from customers to purchase ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline from us over any period of time 
nearly all of our customer revenue through the third quarter of came from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  with the remainder of our revenues coming from collaborations and government grants and  more recently  sales of our renewable products 
in the third quarter of  we transitioned out of the ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline business 
we do not expect to be able to replace much of the revenue lost as a result of this transition  particularly in  while we continue our efforts to establish a renewable products business 
intellectual property our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications in our product areas and technologies to be aware of developments that may affect our business  and to the extent we identify such developments  evaluate and take appropriate courses of action 
with respect to the former  our policy is to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the us patent and trademark office  or the uspto  and its foreign counterparts 
as of march   we had issued us and foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications that are owned by or licensed to us 
we also use other forms of protection such as trademark  copyright  and trade secret to protect our intellectual property  particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
we aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach provides us with a strong proprietary position 
we have obtained patents for various fuel products us patent no 
 directed to our renewable diesel fuel composition  us patent no 
 directed to our renewable gasoline fuel composition  and us patents no 
 and no 
 which are directed to our renewable jet products 
since obtaining our fuels patents  we have expanded the use of this program to our chemicals portfolio and have recently obtained us patent nos 
 and  for our lubricant products  and us patent nos 
 and  for our adhesive and polymer products 
patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained 
the actual protection afforded by patent  which can vary from country to country  depends on the type of patent  the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country 
see risk factors risks relating to our business our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates 
we also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees  consultants  contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement 
agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us 
in addition  we also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials 
competition we expect that our renewable products will compete with both the traditional  largely petroleum based specialty chemical and fuels products that are currently being used in our target markets and with the alternatives to these existing products that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to produce 
chemical products in the specialty chemical markets that we are initially seeking to enter  and in other chemical markets that we may seek to enter in the future  we will compete with the established providers of chemicals currently used in these products 
producers of these incumbent products include global oil companies  large international chemical companies and companies specializing in specific products  such as squalane or essential oils 
we may also compete in one or more of these markets with products that are offered as alternatives to the traditional petroleum based or other traditional products being offered in these markets 
transportation fuel products in the transportation fuels market  we expect to compete with independent and integrated oil refiners  advanced biofuels companies and biodiesel companies 
refiners compete with us by selling traditional fuel products and some are also pursuing hydrocarbon fuel production using non renewable feedstocks  such as natural gas and coal  as well as processes using renewable feedstocks  such as vegetable oil and biomass 
we also expect to compete with companies that are developing the capacity to produce diesel and other transportation fuels from renewable resources in other ways 
these include advanced biofuels companies using specific enzymes that they have developed to convert cellulosic biomass  which is non food plant material such as wood chips  corn stalks and sugarcane bagasse  into fermentable sugars 
similar to us  some companies are seeking to use engineered enzymes to convert sugars  in some cases from cellulosic biomass and in others from natural sugar sources  into renewable diesel and other fuels 
biodiesel companies convert vegetable oils and animal oils into diesel fuel and some are seeking to produce diesel and other transportation fuels using thermochemical methods to convert biomass into renewable fuels 
with the emergence of many new companies seeking to produce chemicals and fuels from alternative sources  we may face increasing competition from alternative fuels and chemicals companies 
as they emerge  some of these companies may be able to establish production capacity and commercial partnerships to compete with us 
competitive factors we believe the primary competitive factors in both the chemicals and fuels markets are product price  product performance and other measures of quality  infrastructure compatibility of products  sustainability  and dependability of supply 
we believe that for our chemical products to succeed in the market  we must demonstrate that our products are comparable alternatives to existing products and to any alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of product cost  availability  performance  and consumer preference characteristics 
with respect to our diesel and other transportation fuels products  we believe that our product must perform as effectively as petroleum based fuel  or alternative fuels  and be available on a cost competitive basis 
in addition  with the wide range of renewable fuels products under development  we must be successful in reaching potential customers and convincing them that ours are effective and reliable alternatives 
environmental and other regulatory matters our development and production processes involve the use  generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and international laws  regulations and permit requirements governing the use  generation  manufacture  transportation  storage  handling and disposal of these materials in the us  brazil and other countries where we operate or may operate or sell our products in the future 
these laws  regulations and permits can require expensive fees  pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of our technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines  civil sanctions  permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation 
we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting 
however  future developments including our commencement of commercial manufacturing of one or more of our products  more stringent environmental regulation  policies and enforcement  the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors risks relating to our business we may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations  and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities 
the use of genetically modified microorganisms  or gmms  such as our yeast strains  is subject to laws and regulations in many countries 
in the us  the epa regulates the commercial use of gmms as well as potential products produced from the gmms 
various states within the us could choose to regulate products made with gmms as well 
while the strain of genetically modified yeast that we use  s 
cerevisiae  is eligible for exemption from epa review because the epa recognizes it as posing a low risk we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption  including but not limited to use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures 
in brazil  gmms are regulated by ctnbio under its biosafety law no 
we have obtained approval from ctnbio to generally use gmms under specific conditions in our campinas facilities and our production plant in brotas for research and development purposes 
in addition  we have received ctnbio approval for commercial use of a specific strain in our brotas plant 
we expect to encounter gmm regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to make our products  however  the scope and nature of these regulations will likely be different from country to country 
if we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce our products using our yeast strains  then our business will be adversely affected 
see risk factors risks related to our business our use of genetically modified feedstocks and yeast strains to produce our products subjects us to risks of regulatory limitations and rejection of our products 
our renewable chemical products may be subject to regulation by government agencies in our target markets 
the epa administers the requirements of the toxic substances control act  or the tsca  which regulates the commercial use of chemicals 
before an entity can manufacture a chemical  it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the tsca inventory 
if the substance is listed  then manufacture can commence immediately 
if not  then in most cases a chemical abstracts service number registration and pre manufacture notice must be filed with the epa  which has up to days to review the filing 
our diesel fuel is subject to regulation by various government agencies 
in the us  this includes the epa and the carb 
in brazil  this includes anp 
to date we have obtained registration with the epa for the use of our diesel in the us at a blend rate with petroleum diesel 
in addition  anp has authorized the use of our diesel fuel at blend rates of and for specific bus fleets 
we are also currently in the process of registering our fuel with the carb and the european commission 
registration with each of these bodies is required for the sale and use of our fuels within their respective jurisdictions 
in addition  for us to achieve full access to the us fuels market for our fuel products  we will need to obtain epa and carb and potentially other state agencies certifications for our feedstock pathway and production facility  including certification of a feedstock lifecycle analysis relating to greenhouse gas emissions 
any delay in obtaining these additional certifications could impair our ability to sell our renewable fuels to refiners  importers  blenders and other parties that produce transportation fuels as they comply with federal and state requirements to include certified renewable fuels in their products 
see risk factors risks relating to our business we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products 
amyris fuels is subject to various us federal regulations relating to its marketing and distribution of ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline  and it is registered with the epa in connection with its use of ethanol as a fuel additive 
in addition  amyris fuels is subject to various state regulations  including regulations regarding excise tax payments and the posting of surety bonds 
research and development we devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts 
as of march   our research and development organization included approximately employees  of whom held phdsour technology development is currently focused primarily on improving the performance of our production strains and on developing strains that produce new molecules 
to facilitate the transfer of our fermentation technology to production  we operate pilot scale fermentation facilities in both emeryville  california and campinas  brazil  and transfer strains on a regular basis 
our process consists of a number of discrete steps including identifying new target molecules creating new microbial strains capable of producing the target molecule increasing product yield and productivity from microbial strains through strain modification or fermentation improvements increasing efficiency of product separation and purification continuous translation of these steps from lab to commercial scale production 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million  and million and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
employees as of march   we had full time employees 
of these employees  were in the us and were in brazil 
except for labor union representation for brazil based employees based on labor code requirements in brazil  none of our employees is represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced any employment related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good

risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below  together with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or future results 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely harmed 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and  as a result  you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we have incurred losses to date  anticipate continuing to incur losses in the future and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we have incurred significant losses in each year since our inception and believe that we will continue to incur losses and negative cash flow from operations into at least as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations related to purchase commitments  as well as capital and operating leases 
as of december   our debt totaled million  of which million matures within the next twelve months 
in addition  our debt agreements contain various covenants  including restrictions on business that could cause us to be at risk of defaults 
we expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business  including construction and operation of our manufacturing facilities  our research and development operations  continued operation of our pilot plants and demonstration facility  and engineering and design work 
further  we expect to incur costs related to contract manufacturing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have limited experience producing our products at commercial scale and may not be able to commercialize our products to the extent necessary to sustain and grow our current business 
to commercialize our products  we must be successful in using our yeast strains to produce target molecules at commercial scale and at a commercially viable cost 
such production will require that our technology and processes be scaled from laboratory  pilot and demonstration projects to commercial scale production 
if we cannot achieve commercially viable production economics  we will be unable to achieve a sustainable integrated renewable products business 
most of our commercial manufacturing experience to date has been at contract manufacturing facilities 
for the future  we are focused on developing most of our production capacity through purpose built  large scale production plants in brazil  which is a time consuming  costly  uncertain and expensive process 
given our limited experience commissioning and operating our own manufacturing facilities and our limited financial resources  we cannot be sure that we will be successful in commissioning and scaling up production at these larger scale plants  either in a timely manner or with production economics that allow us to meet our plans for commercialization 
even to the extent we successfully complete product development in our laboratories and pilot and demonstration facilities  and at contract manufacturing facilities  we may be unable to translate such success to large scale  purpose built plants 
if this occurs  our ability to commercialize our technology will be adversely affected and we may be unable to produce and sell any significant volumes of our products 
also  with respect to products that we are able to bring to market  we may not be able to lower the cost of production  which would adversely affect our ability to sell such products profitably 
we will require additional financing to fund our anticipated operations and may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all 
our planned working capital needs and our planned operating and capital expenditures for are dependent on significant inflows of cash from existing collaboration partners  as well as additional funding from new collaborations  equity or debt offerings  credit facilities or loans  or combinations of these sources 
we will continue to need to fund our research and development and related activities and to provide working capital to fund production  storage  distribution and other aspects of its business 
our operating plan contemplates capital expenditures of approximately million in and we expect to continue to incur costs in connection with our existing contract manufacturing arrangements 
furthermore  we are expecting additional funding in from collaborations  equity or debt offerings  or combinations of these sources 
our operating plan contemplates securing a portion of this additional funding in the second quarter of however  as of the date of this filing  we have not yet secured this additional funding and there can be no assurance that financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
for example  some of our existing anticipated financing sources  such as research and development collaborations  are subject to risk that we cannot meet milestones or are not yet subject to definitive agreements or mandatory funding commitments and we may not be able to secure additional equity or debt financing in a timely manner or on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we seek additional types of funding that involve the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders would suffer dilution 
for example  in  we completed private placements of our common stock that resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock of which approximately million shares were issued in january following receipt of proceeds 
we also issued approximately million in unsecured senior convertible promissory notes that are convertible into common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
through  we expect to issue up to an aggregate of million in additional unsecured senior convertible promissory notes under the agreements with total described below under the caption  our relationship with our strategic partner  total  may have a substantial impact on our company 
in addition to dilution  to the extent we issue convertible promissory notes and similar instruments  we would become subject to various covenants  including restrictions on our business  that could cause us to be at risk of defaults 
for example  the convertible notes we issued in contained various covenants  including restrictions on the amount of debt we are permitted to incur 
if we are unable to raise additional financing  or if other expected sources of funding are delayed or not received  we would take the following actions as early as the second quarter of to support our liquidity needs through the remainder of and into effect significant headcount reductions in the us and in brazil  particularly with respect to both general and administrative employees and other employees not connected to critical or contracted activities 
shift our focus to existing products and customers with significantly reduced investment in new product and commercial development efforts 
reduce our expenditures for third party contractors  including consultants  professional advisors and other vendors 
suspend operations at our pilot plants and demonstration facilities 
reduce or delay uncommitted capital expenditures  including non essential lab equipment and information technology projects 
the contingency cash plan contemplating these actions is designed to save us an estimated million to million over the next twelve months 
implementing this plan could have a material negative impact on our ability to continue our business as currently contemplated  including  without limitation  delays or failures in our ability to achieve planned production levels  develop and commercialize products within planned timelines or at planned scales  and continue other core activities 
furthermore  any inability to scale back operations as necessary  and any unexpected liquidity needs  could create pressure to implement more severe measures 
such measures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet contractual requirements  including obligations to maintain manufacturing operations  and increase the severity of the consequences described above 
we also may be forced to seek funding on terms that are not favorable to us 
for example  in order to raise sufficient funds  we could be forced to issue preferred and discounted equity  agree to onerous covenants  grant security interests in our assets  enter into collaboration and licensing arrangements that require us to relinquish commercial rights or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us  or any or all of these 
if our major production facilities do not successfully commence operations  our customer relationships  business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
a substantial component of our planned production capacity in the near and long term depends on successful operations at our initial and planned large scale production plants in brazil 
we are in the early stages of operating our first purpose built  large scale production plant in brotas and may complete construction of certain other facilities in the coming years 
delays or problems in the construction  start up or operation of these facilities will cause delays in our ramp up of production and hamper our ability to reduce our production costs 
delays in construction can occur due to a variety of factors  including regulatory requirements and our ability to fund construction and commissioning costs 
once our large scale production facilities are built  we must successfully commission them and they must perform as we have designed them 
if we encounter significant delays  cost overruns  engineering issues  contamination problems  equipment supply constraints or other serious challenges in bringing these facilities online and operating them at commercial scale  we may be unable to produce our initial renewable products in the time frame we have planned 
we may also need to continue to use contract manufacturing sources more than we expect  which would reduce our anticipated gross margins and may prevent us from accessing certain markets for our products 
further  if our efforts to complete and commence production at these facilities are not successful  other mill owners in brazil may decide not to work with us to develop additional production facilities  demand more favorable terms or delay their commitment to invest capital in our production 
our reliance on the large scale production plant in brotas subjects us to execution and economic risks 
our decision to focus our efforts for production capacity on the manufacturing facility in brotas means that we will have limited manufacturing sources for our products in and beyond 
accordingly  any failure to establish operations at that plant could have a significant negative impact on our business  including our ability to achieve commercial viability for our products 
construction and commissioning of the plant in brotas was recently completed  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully scale up and operate the plant at levels sufficient to supply farnesene previously produced at contract manufacturing facilities 
furthermore  while we are moving our production focus to our plant in brotas based on an expectation that we will ultimately be able to produce farnesene at a lower cost using such facility  we cannot be sure when  or if  using such plant will in fact result in such lower production costs than contract manufacturing facilities 
also  with the facility in brotas  we will  for the first time  be the operator of a commercial fermentation and separation facility 
we are inexperienced at operating plants and may face unexpected difficulties associated with the operation of the plant 
for example  we have in the past  at certain contract manufacturing facilities  encountered significant delays and difficulties in ramping up production based on contamination in the production process  problems with plant utilities  lack of automation and related human error  issues arising from process modifications to reduce costs and adjust product specifications  and other similar challenges 
such challenges could arise in our plant in brotas  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to remedy them quickly or effectively enough to achieve commercially viable near term production costs and volumes 
as part of our arrangement to build the plant in brotas  we have an agreement with para so bioenergia to purchase from para so bioenergia sugarcane juice corresponding to a certain number of tons of sugarcane per year  along with specified water and vapor volumes 
until this annual volume is reached  we are restricted from purchasing sugarcane juice for processing in the facility from any third party  subject to limited exceptions  unless we pay the premium to para so bioenergia that we would have paid if we bought the juice from them 
as such  we will be relying on para so bioenergia to supply such juice and utilities on a timely basis  in the volumes we need  and at competitive prices 
if a third party can offer superior prices and para so bioenergia does not consent to our purchasing from such third party  we would be required to pay para so bioenergia the applicable premium  which would have a negative impact on our production cost 
furthermore  we agreed to pay a price for the juice that is based on the lower of the cost of two other products produced by para so bioenergia using such juice  plus a premium 
para so bioenergia may not want to sell sugarcane juice to us if the price of one of the other products is substantially higher than the one setting the price for the juice we purchase 
while the agreement provides that para so bioenergia would have to pay a penalty to us if it fails to supply the agreed upon volume of juice for a given month  the penalty may not be enough to compensate us for the increased cost if third party suppliers do not offer competitive prices 
also  if the prices of the other products produced by para so bioenergia increase  we could be forced to pay those increased prices for production without a related increase in the price at which we can sell our products  reducing or eliminating any margins we can otherwise achieve 
if in the future these supply terms no longer provide a viable economic structure for the operation in brotas  we may be required to renegotiate our agreement  which could result in manufacturing disruptions and delays 
our joint venture with usina s o martinho subjects us to certain legal and financial terms that could adversely affect us 
we have various agreements with usina s o martinho that contemplate construction of another large scale manufacturing facility in brazil 
under these agreements  we are responsible for designing and managing the construction project  and are responsible for the initial construction costs 
we projected the construction costs of the project to be approximately us million 
while we completed a significant portion of the construction of the plant before  we delayed further construction and commissioning of the plant while we constructed and commissioned our production plant in brotas  and we expect to continue to defer the project for the near term based on economic considerations and to allow us to focus on successful implementation at our production plant in brotas 
while usina s o martinho was obligated to contribute up to approximately r million approximately us million based on the exchange rate as of december  to the construction of the plant  such contributions depended on  among other things  successful commencement of operations at the plant 
based on our shifting manufacturing priorities and uncertainty regarding financing availability  we cannot currently predict when or if our facility at usina s o martinho will be completed or commence commercial operations  which means that usina s o martinho anticipated contribution will be delayed and may never occur 
under our existing agreement with usina s o martinho  if the joint venture fails to commence operations by the end of  usina s o martinho has the right to terminate the joint venture and to require us to buy usina s o martinho equity in the joint venture at its acquisition cost  and transfer the joint venture assets at the usina s o martinho site to another location 
in that event  we would incur significant costs and be required to find alternative locations for the facility 
in march  we met with usina s o martinho and the parties agreed in principle to a revised business plan for the joint venture with the plant becoming operational in  and  while we are in the process of documenting that revised business plan as an amendment to the agreement  we may not be able to reach final agreement on the revised terms 
in addition  if amyris brasil becomes controlled  directly or indirectly  by a competitor of usina s o martinho  then usina s o martinho has the right to acquire our interest in the joint venture and if usina s o martinho becomes controlled  directly or indirectly  by a competitor of ours  then we have the right to sell our interest in the joint venture to usina s o martinho 
in either case  the purchase price is to be determined in accordance with the joint venture agreements  and we would continue to have the obligation to acquire products produced by the joint venture for the remainder of the term of the supply agreement then in effect even though we might no longer be involved in the joint venture management 
if we are ultimately successful in establishing the plant at usina s o martinho  the agreements governing the joint venture subject us to terms that may not be favorable to us under certain conditions 
for example  we are required to purchase the output of the joint venture for the first four years at a price that guarantees the return of usina s o martinho investment plus a fixed interest rate 
we may not be able to sell the output at a price that allows us to achieve anticipated  or any  level of profitability on the product we acquire under these terms 
similarly  the return that we are required to provide the joint venture for products after the first four years may have an adverse effect on the profitability we achieve from acquiring the mill output 
additionally  our purchase obligation with the mill requires us to purchase the output regardless of whether we have a customer for such output  and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we are unable to sell the output that we are required to purchase 
our reliance on and relationships with contract manufacturers exposes us to risks relating to costs  contractual terms and logistics 
we commenced commercial production of biofene and some specialty chemical products in through the use of contract manufacturers  and we anticipate that we will continue to use contract manufacturers for chemical conversion and production of end products and  to mitigate cost and volume risks at our large scale production facilities  for production of biofene 
establishing and operating contract manufacturing facilities requires us to make significant capital expenditures  which reduces our cash and places this capital at risk 
for example  based on an evaluation of our assets associated with contract manufacturing facilities and anticipated levels of use of such facilities  we recorded a loss on write off of production assets of approximately million in the year ended december  further write off of such assets may occur in future quarters as we continue to evaluate and adjust our priorities for production  including the levels of utilization of our current and planned manufacturing facilities  which would cause us to incur additional losses associated with such facilities in the future 
also  many of our contract manufacturing agreements contain terms that commit us to pay for capital expenditures and other costs incurred or expected to be earned by the plant operators and owners  which can result in contractual liability and losses for us even if we terminate a particular contract manufacturing arrangement or decide to reduce or stop production under such an arrangement 
we incurred a million loss in the year ended december  related to million in facility modification costs and million of fixed purchase commitment losses associated with a scale back of production at certain facilities 
some of our contract manufacturing agreements have also contained requirements to pay bonuses for milestone achievements by the contractor  minimum offtake requirements with penalties for failure to purchase specified amounts in a given period  and other terms that created contingent liabilities or other obligations for us 
any failure to comply with such requirements could result in legal claims against us  resulting in additional liability and diverting management attention  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the locations of contract manufacturers can pose additional cost  logistics and feedstock challenges 
if production capacity is available at a plant that is remote from usable chemical finishing or distribution facilities  or from customers  we will be required to incur additional expenses in shipping products to other locations 
such costs could include shipping costs  compliance with export and import controls  tariffs and additional taxes  among others 
in addition  we may be required to use feedstock from a particular region for a given production facility 
the feedstock available in a particular region may not be the least expensive or most effective feedstock for production  which could significantly raise our overall production cost until we are able to optimize the supply chain 
loss or termination of contract manufacturing relationships could harm our ability to meet our production goals 
as we have focused on building and commissioning our own plant and improving our production economics  we have limited our use of contract manufacturing and have terminated relationships with some of our contract manufacturing partners 
the failure to have multiple available supply options could create a risk for us if a single source or a limited number of sources of manufacturing runs into operational issues 
in addition  if we are unable to secure the services of contract manufacturers when and as needed  we may lose customer opportunities and the growth of our business may be impaired 
we cannot be sure that contract manufacturers will be available when we need their services  that they will be willing to dedicate a portion of their capacity to our projects  or that we will be able to reach acceptable price and other terms with them for the provision of their production services 
if we shift priorities and stop or adjust anticipated production levels at contract manufacturing facilities  such adjustments could also result in disputes or otherwise harm our business relationships with contract manufacturers 
in addition  reducing or stopping production at one facility while increasing or starting up production at another facility generally results in significant losses of production efficiency  which can persist for varying periods of time 
also  in order for production to commence under our contract manufacturing arrangements  we will generally have to provide equipment needed for the production of our products and we cannot be assured that such equipment can be ordered  or installed  on a timely basis  at acceptable costs  or at all 
further  in order to establish new manufacturing facilities  we need to transfer our yeast strains and production processes from lab to commercial plants controlled by third parties  which may pose technical or operational challenges that delay production or increase our costs 
if we are unable to decrease our production costs  we may not be able to produce our products at competitive prices and our ability to grow our business will be limited 
currently  our costs of production are not low enough to allow us to offer many of our planned products at competitive prices 
our production costs depend on many factors that could have a negative effect on our ability to offer our planned products at competitive prices 
key factors beyond production scale and feedstock cost that impact our production costs include yield  productivity  separation efficiency and chemical process efficiency 
yield refers to the amount of the desired molecule that can be produced from a fixed amount of feedstock 
productivity represents the rate at which our product is produced by a given yeast strain 
separation efficiency refers to the amount of desired product produced in the fermentation process that we are able to extract and the time that it takes to do so 
chemical process efficiency refers to the cost and yield for the chemical finishing steps that convert our target molecule into a desired product 
in order to successfully enter transportation fuels and certain chemical markets  we must produce those products at significantly lower costs  which will require both substantially higher yields than we have achieved to date and other significant improvements in production efficiency  including in productivity and in separation and chemical process efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to make these improvements or reduce our production costs sufficiently to offer our planned products at competitive prices  and any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects 
our ability to establish substantial commercial sales of our products is subject to many risks  any of which could prevent or delay revenue growth and adversely impact our customer relationships  business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our products will be approved or accepted by customers  that customers will choose our products over competing products  or that we will be able to sell our products profitably at prices and with features sufficient to establish demand 
the markets we intend to enter first are primarily those for specialty chemical products used by large consumer products or specialty chemical companies 
in entering these markets  we intend to sell our products as alternatives to chemicals currently in use  and in some cases the chemicals that we seek to replace have been used for many years 
the potential customers for our molecules generally have well developed manufacturing processes and arrangements with suppliers of the chemical components of their products and may have a resistance to changing these processes and components 
these potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers  influenced by consumer preference  manufacturing considerations such as process changes and capital and other costs associated with transitioning to alternative components  supplier operating history  regulatory issues  product liability and other factors  many of which are unknown to  or not well understood by  us 
satisfying these processes may take many months or years 
if we are unable to convince these potential customers and the consumers who purchase products containing such chemicals that our products are comparable to the chemicals that they currently use or that the use of our products is otherwise to their benefits  we will not be successful in entering these markets and our business will be adversely affected 
in order for our diesel fuel to be accepted in various countries around the world  diesel engine manufacturers must determine that the use of our fuels in their equipment will not invalidate product warranties and that they otherwise regard our diesel fuel as an acceptable fuel 
in addition  we must successfully demonstrate to these manufacturers that our fuel does not degrade the performance or reduce the life cycle of their engines or cause them to fail to meet emissions standards 
meeting these suitability standards can be a time consuming and expensive process  and we may invest substantial time and resources into such qualification efforts without ultimately securing approval 
to date  our diesel fuel has achieved limited approvals from certain engine manufacturers  but we cannot be assured that other engine or vehicle manufacturers or fleet operators  will approve usage of our fuels 
to distribute our diesel fuel  we must also meet requirements imposed by pipeline operators and fuel distributors 
if these operators impose volume limitations on the transport of our fuels  our ability to sell our fuels may be impaired 
our ability to sell a jet fuel product is subject to similar types of qualification requirements as diesel  although we believe the qualification process will ultimately take longer and will be more expensive than the process for diesel 
we expect to face competition for our specialty chemical and transportation fuels products from providers of petroleum based products and from other companies seeking to provide alternatives to these products  and if we cannot compete effectively against these companies or products we may not be successful in bringing our products to market or further growing our business after we do so 
we expect that our renewable products will compete with both the traditional  largely petroleum based specialty chemical and fuels products that are currently being used in our target markets and with the alternatives to these existing products that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to produce 
in the specialty chemical markets that we are initially seeking to enter  and in other chemical markets that we may seek to enter in the future  we will compete primarily with the established providers of chemicals currently used in these products 
producers of these incumbent products include global oil companies  large international chemical companies and companies specializing in specific products  such as squalane or essential oils 
we may also compete in one or more of these markets with products that are offered as alternatives to the traditional petroleum based or other traditional products being offered in these markets 
in the transportation fuels market  we expect to compete with independent and integrated oil refiners  advanced biofuels companies and biodiesel companies 
refiners compete with us by selling traditional fuel products and some are also pursuing hydrocarbon fuel production using non renewable feedstocks  such as natural gas and coal  as well as processes using renewable feedstocks  such as vegetable oil and biomass 
we also expect to compete with companies that are developing the capacity to produce diesel and other transportation fuels from renewable resources in other ways 
these include advanced biofuels companies using specific enzymes that they have developed to convert cellulosic biomass  which is non food plant material such as wood chips  corn stalks and sugarcane bagasse  into fermentable sugars 
similar to us  some companies are seeking to use engineered enzymes to convert sugars  in some cases from cellulosic biomass and in others from natural sugar sources  into renewable diesel and other fuels 
biodiesel companies convert vegetable oils and animal oils into diesel fuel and some are seeking to produce diesel and other transportation fuels using thermochemical methods to convert biomass into renewable fuels 
with the emergence of many new companies seeking to produce chemicals and fuels from alternative sources  we may face increasing competition from alternative fuels and chemicals companies 
as they emerge  some of these companies may be able to establish production capacity and commercial partnerships to compete with us 
if we are unable to establish production and sales channels that allow us to offer comparable products at attractive prices  we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies 
we believe the primary competitive factors in both the chemicals and fuels markets are product price  product performance and other measures of quality  infrastructure compatibility of products  sustainability  and dependability of supply 
the oil companies  large chemical companies and well established agricultural products companies with whom we compete are much larger than we are  have  in many cases  well developed distribution systems and networks for their products  have valuable historical relationships with the potential customers we are seeking to serve and have much more extensive sales and marketing programs in place to promote their products 
in order to be successful  we must convince customers that our products are at least as effective as the traditional products they are seeking to replace and we must provide our products on a cost competitive basis with these traditional products and other available alternatives 
some of our competitors may use their influence to impede the development and acceptance of renewable products of the type that we are seeking to produce 
we believe that for our chemical products to succeed in the market  we must demonstrate that our products are comparable alternatives to existing products and to any alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of product cost  availability  performance  and consumer preference characteristics 
with respect to our diesel and other transportation fuels products  we believe that our product must perform as effectively as petroleum based fuel  or alternative fuels  and be available on a cost competitive basis 
in addition  with the wide range of renewable fuels products under development  we must be successful in reaching potential customers and convincing them that ours are effective and reliable alternatives 
our relationship with our strategic partner  total  has a substantial impact on our company 
we have a license  development  research and collaboration agreement with total  under which we may develop  produce and commercialize products with total  that originally contemplated total paying up to the first million in research costs for selected research and development projects which arrangement has been modified as described below 
as of march   total held approximately of our outstanding common stock 
under the agreement  total has a right of first negotiation with us with respect to exclusive commercialization arrangements that we would propose to enter into with certain third parties  as well as the right to purchase any of our products on terms not less favorable than those offered to or received by us from third parties in any market where total or its affiliates have a significant market position 
these rights might inhibit potential strategic partners or potential customers from entering into negotiations with us about future business opportunities 
total also has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement in the event we undergo a sale or change of control to certain entities  which could discourage a potential acquirer from making an offer to acquire us 
in november  we entered into an amendment of the collaboration agreement with total with respect to development and commercialization of biofene for diesel 
this represented an expansion of the initial collaboration that the parties established in  and established a global  exclusive collaboration for the development of biofene for diesel and a framework for the creation of a joint venture to manufacture and commercialize biofene for diesel 
in addition  a limited number of other potential products were subject to development for the joint venture on a non exclusive basis 
in july  we entered into a further amendment of the collaboration agreement with total that expanded total investment in the biofene collaboration  incorporated the development of certain joint venture products for use in diesel and jet fuel into the scope of the collaboration  and changed the structure of the funding from total to include a convertible debt mechanism 
under the new agreements  total funded million in new cash investment during the third quarter of and  in march  agreed to provide an additional million in total may decide to provide further funding in upon completion of the research and development program  we and total would form a joint venture company that would have exclusive rights to produce and market renewable diesel and or jet fuel 
should total decide not to pursue commercialization  under certain conditions  it is eligible to recover up to million  payable in march  in the form of cash or in the form of common stock at a conversion price of per share or  for notes issued in  a lower price as determined under the march letter agreement as described below in md a overview total 
under the agreements related to the july amendment  the million in funding by total originally contemplated under the collaboration agreement is deemed to be exhausted  so the funding under the most recent amendment is all the funding still contemplated by our agreements with total 
we cannot be certain that total will choose to continue funding the research and development program or ultimately opt in to participate in the anticipated joint venture 
under the new agreements  total may  at certain decision points through a final decision date following the earlier of completion of the research and development program or december   decide not to continue funding or participating in the program and  if it does  any notes issued to total to date will remain outstanding and become payable or convertible into our common stock 
if total chooses to demand repayment of amounts advanced under the notes  we may not be able to repay them by the maturity date in march  which could lead to defaults and our insolvency  and total and other creditors could pursue collection claims against us 
if the notes become convertible and total chooses to convert them  the resulting issuance of common stock would be dilutive to other stockholders 
under the july agreements  total also has a right to participate in our future equity or convertible debt financings through december  to preserve its pro rata ownership of us and thereafter in limited circumstances 
the agreements provided that the purchase price for the first million of purchases under this pro rata right would be paid by cancellation of outstanding notes held by total  total canceled million of an outstanding convertible promissory note in connection with a private placement in december  which reduced the amount of notes it could cancel to exercise its pro rata rights by million 
exercise by total of this right by cancellation of notes reduces the cash proceeds we receive from any covered offering 
the new agreements provide that we will provide an exclusive license to our intellectual property related to the manufacture and commercialization of biofene based diesel and jet fuel to the above mentioned fuels joint venture  and also contemplate providing an option to total to buy out our interest in the joint venture under certain circumstances such as our insolvency 
furthermore  the new agreements contemplate that total can  if there is a deadlock in finalizing various matters related to the formation of the joint venture  initiate a bidding process where the fair value of the proposed joint venture would be determined and we would be required to choose whether to i sell our joint venture assets to total for of the joint venture value  ii proceed with formation of the joint venture with total as a owner and accept total position regarding the funding requirements of the joint venture  or iii proceed with the formation of the joint venture with total as a owner  accepting total position regarding the funding requirements of the joint venture  and then sell all or a portion of our interest in the joint venture to total for a price equal to the fair value multiplied by the percentage ownership of the joint venture sold to total 
if we are forced to relinquish our rights with respect to diesel and jet fuel under these scenarios or under an early exclusive license as described above  our ability to continue pursuing our fuels business will be impaired 
if we do not meet technical  development and commercial milestones in our collaboration agreements  our future revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted 
we have entered into a number of agreements regarding the further development of certain of our products and  in some cases  for ultimate sale of certain products to the customer under the agreement 
none of these agreements affirmatively obligates the other party to purchase specific quantities of any products at this time  and most contain important conditions that must be satisfied before additional research and development funding or product purchases would occur 
these conditions include research and development milestones and technical specifications that must be achieved to the satisfaction of our collaborators  which we cannot be certain we will achieve 
if we do not achieve these contractual milestones  our revenues and financial results will be harmed 
we are subject to risks related to our reliance on collaboration arrangements to fund development and commercialization of our products 
for most product markets we are trying to address  we either have or are seeking collaboration partners to fund the research and development  commercialization and production efforts required for the target products 
typically we provide limited exclusive rights and revenue sharing with respect to the production and sale of particular types of products in specific markets in exchange for such up front funding 
these exclusivity  revenue sharing and other similar terms limit our ability to commercialize our products and technology  and may impact the size of our business or our profitability in ways that we do not currently envision 
in addition  revenues from these types of relationships are a key part of our cash plan for and beyond 
if we fail to collect expected collaboration revenues  or to identify and add sufficient additional collaborations to fund our planned operations  we may be unable to fund our operations or pursue development and commercialization of our planned products 
to achieve our collaboration revenue targets from year to year  we may be forced to enter into agreements that contain less favorable terms  including broader exclusivity provisions for commercial partners and a smaller financial stake in any successful ventures resulting from collaborations 
our manufacturing operations require sugar feedstock  and the inability to obtain such feedstock in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner  or at reasonable prices  may limit our ability to produce our products profitably  or at all 
we anticipate that the production of our products will require large volumes of feedstock 
we have relied on a mixture of feedstock sources for use at our contract manufacturing operations  including cane sugar  corn based dextrose and beet molasses 
for our large scale production facilities in brazil  we are relying primarily on brazilian sugarcane 
we cannot predict the future availability or price of these various feedstocks  nor can we be sure that our mill partners  which we expect to supply the sugarcane feedstock necessary to produce our products in brazil  will be able to supply it in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner 
furthermore  to the extent we are required to rely on sugar feedstock other than brazilian sugarcane  the cost of such feedstock may be higher than we expect  increasing our anticipated production costs 
feedstock crop yields and sugar content depend on weather conditions  such as rainfall and temperature 
weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the ethanol and sugar industries by causing crop failures or reduced harvests 
excessive rainfall can adversely affect the supply of sugarcane and other sugar feedstock available for the production of our products by reducing the sucrose content and limiting growers ability to harvest 
crop disease and pestilence can also occur from time to time and can adversely affect feedstock growth  potentially rendering useless or unusable all or a substantial portion of affected harvests 
with respect to sugarcane  our initial primary feedstock  the limited amount of time during which it keeps its sugar content after harvest and the fact that sugarcane is not itself a traded commodity increases these risks and limits our ability to substitute supply in the event of such an occurrence 
if production of sugarcane or any other feedstock we may use to produce our products is adversely affected by these or other conditions  our production will be impaired  and our business will be adversely affected 
the price of sugarcane and other feedstocks can be volatile as a result of changes in industry policy and may increase the cost of production of our products 
in brazil  conselho dos produtores de cana  a car e lcool council of sugarcane  sugar and ethanol producers  or consecana  an industry association of producers of sugarcane  sugar and ethanol  sets market terms and prices for general supply  lease and partnership agreements for sugarcane 
if consecana makes changes to such terms and prices  this could result higher sugarcane prices and or a significant decrease in the volume of sugarcane available for the production of our products 
furthermore  if consecana were to cease to be involved in this process  such prices and terms could become more volatile 
similar principles apply to pricing of other feedstocks as well 
any of these events could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our large scale commercial production capacity is centered in brazil  and our business will be adversely affected if we do not operate effectively in that country 
for the foreseeable future  we will be subject to risks associated with the concentration of essential product sourcing and operations in brazil 
the brazilian government has changed in the past  and may change in the future  monetary  taxation  credit  tariff and other policies to influence the course of brazil economy 
for example  the government actions to control inflation have at times involved setting wage and price controls  adjusting interest rates  imposing taxes and exchange controls and limiting imports into brazil 
we have no control over  and cannot predict  what policies or actions the brazilian government may take in the future 
our business  financial performance and prospects may be adversely affected by  among others  the following factors delays or failures in securing licenses  permits or other governmental approvals necessary to build and operate facilities and use our yeast strains to produce products  rapid consolidation in the sugar and ethanol industries in brazil  which could result in a decrease in competition  political  economic  diplomatic or social instability in or affecting brazil  changing interest rates  tax burden and policies  effects of changes in currency exchange rates  exchange controls and restrictions on remittances abroad  inflation  land reform movements  export or import restrictions that limit our ability to move our products out of brazil or interfere with the import of essential materials into brazil  changes in or interpretations of foreign regulations that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products or repatriate profits to the us  tariffs  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  successful compliance with us and foreign laws that regulate the conduct of business abroad  an inability  or reduced ability  to protect our intellectual property in brazil including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action  and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations 
we cannot predict whether the current or future brazilian government will implement changes to existing policies on taxation  exchange controls  monetary strategy  social security and the like  nor can we estimate the impact of any such changes on the brazilian economy or our operations 
our international operations expose us to the risk of fluctuation in currency exchange rates and rates of foreign inflation  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently incur significant costs and expenses in brazilian reais and may in the future incur additional expenses in foreign currencies and derive a portion of our revenues in the local currencies of customers throughout the world 
as a result  our revenues and results of operations are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations  which we may not be able to manage successfully 
during the past few decades  the brazilian currency in particular has faced frequent and substantial exchange rate fluctuations in relation to the us dollar and other foreign currencies 
there can be no assurance that the brazilian real will not significantly appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar in the future 
we also bear the risk that the rate of inflation in the foreign countries where we incur costs and expenses or the decline in value of the us dollar compared to those foreign currencies will increase our costs as expressed in us dollars 
for example  future measures by the central bank of brazil to control inflation  including interest rate adjustments  intervention in the foreign exchange market and actions to fix the value of the real  may weaken the us dollar in brazil 
whether in brazil or otherwise  we may not be able to adjust the prices of our products to offset the effects of inflation or foreign currency appreciation on our cost structure  which could increase our costs and reduce our net operating margins 
if we do not successfully manage these risks through hedging or other mechanisms  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our use of genetically modified feedstocks and yeast strains to produce our products subjects us to risks of regulatory limitations and rejection of our products 
the use of genetically modified microorganisms  or gmms  such as our yeast strains  is subject to laws and regulations in many countries  some of which are new and some of which are still evolving 
public attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of  and ethical concerns over  genetic research and gmms could influence public acceptance of our technology and products 
in the us  the environmental protection agency  or epa  regulates the commercial use of gmms as well as potential products produced from the gmms 
various states within the us could choose to regulate products made with gmms as well 
while the strain of genetically modified yeast that we currently use for the development and anticipate using for the commercial production of our target molecules  s 
cerevisiae  is eligible for exemption from epa review because it is recognized as posing a low risk  we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption  including but not limited to use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures  and we cannot be sure that we will meet such criteria in a timely manner  or at all 
if exemption of s 
cerevisiae is not obtained  our business may be substantially harmed 
in addition to s 
cerevisiae  we may seek to use different gmms in the future that will require epa approval 
if approval of different gmms is not secured  our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected 
in addition to the regulatory requirements relating directly to our yeast strains and products  we must satisfy the product specification requirements of our customers  which can include requirements that we use non genetically modified feedstocks 
for example  some cosmetics suppliers require that ingredients used in their cosmetics not be produced from any genetically modified feedstocks 
in brazil  gmms are regulated by the national biosafety technical commission  or ctnbio 
we have obtained approval from ctnbio to use gmms in a contained environment in our campinas facilities for research and development purposes as well as at a contract manufacturing facility in brazil 
in addition  we have obtained initial commercial approval from ctnbio for one of our current yeast strains 
as we continue to develop new yeast strains and deploy our technology at new production facilities in brazil  we will be required to obtain further approvals from ctnbio in order to use these strains in commercial production in brazil 
we may not be able to obtain approvals from relevant brazilian authorities on a timely basis  or at all  and if we do not  our ability to produce our products in brazil would be impaired  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to our production operations in the us and brazil  we have been party to contract manufacturing agreements with parties in other production locations around the world  including europe 
the use of gmm technology is strictly regulated in the european union  which has established various directives for member states regarding regulation of the use of such technology  including notification processes for contained use of such technology 
we expect to encounter gmm regulations in most  if not all  of the countries in which we may seek to establish production capabilities  and the scope and nature of these regulations will likely be different from country to country 
if we cannot meet the applicable requirements in other countries in which we intend to produce products using our yeast strains  or if it takes longer than anticipated to obtain such approvals  our business could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products 
our renewable chemical products may be subject to government regulation in our target markets 
in the us  the epa administers the toxic substances control act  or tsca  which regulates the commercial registration  distribution  and use of many chemicals 
before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical  it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the tsca inventory 
if the substance is listed  then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately 
if not  then in most cases a chemical abstracts service number registration and pre manufacture notice must be filed with the epa  which has up to days to review the filing 
some of the products we produce or plan to produce  such as biofene and squalane  are already in the tsca inventory 
others  such as our farnesane diesel and new jet fuel molecules  are not yet listed 
we may not be able to expediently receive approval from the epa to list the molecules we would like to make on the tsca registry  resulting in delays or significant increases in testing requirements 
a similar program exists in the european union  called reach registration  evaluation  authorization  and restriction of chemical substances 
under this program  we need to register our products  including biofene  with the european commission  and this process could cause delays or significant costs 
to the extent that other geographies  such as brazil  may rely on tsca or reach or similar laws and programs for chemical registration in their geographies  delays with the us or european authorities may subsequently delay entry into these markets as well 
our diesel fuel is subject to regulation by various government agencies  including the epa and the carb in the us and anp in brazil 
to date  we have obtained registration with the epa for the use of our diesel fuel in the us at a blend rate with petroleum diesel 
in addition  anp has authorized the use our diesel fuel at blend rates of and for specific bus fleets 
we are also currently in the process of registering our fuel with the carb and the european commission 
registration with each of these bodies is required for the sale and use of our fuels within their respective jurisdictions 
in addition  for us to achieve full access to the us fuels market for our fuel products  we will need to obtain epa and carb and potentially other state agencies certifications for our feedstock pathway and production facilities  including certification of a feedstock lifecycle analysis relating to greenhouse gas emissions 
any delay in obtaining these additional certifications could impair our ability to sell our renewable fuels to refiners  importers  blenders and other parties that produce transportation fuels as they comply with federal and state requirements to include certified renewable fuels in their products 
we expect to encounter regulations in most  if not all  of the countries in which we may seek to sell our renewable chemical and fuel products  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain necessary approvals in a timely manner or at all 
if our chemical and fuel products do not meet applicable regulatory requirements in a particular country or at all  then we may not be able to commercialize our products and our business will be adversely affected 
changes in government regulations  including subsidies and economic incentives  could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
the market for renewable fuels is heavily influenced by foreign  federal  state and local government regulations and policies 
changes to existing or adoption of new domestic or foreign federal  state and local legislative initiatives that impact the production  distribution or sale of renewable fuels may harm our renewable fuels business 
in the us and in a number of other countries  regulations and policies encouraging production and use of alternative fuels have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future 
any reduction in mandated requirements for fuel alternatives and additives to gasoline or diesel may cause demand for biofuels to decline and deter investment in the research and development of renewable fuels 
the market uncertainty regarding this and future standards and policies may also affect our ability to develop new renewable products or to license our technologies to third parties and to sell products to our end customers 
any inability to address these requirements and any regulatory or policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concerns associated with renewable fuels  including land usage  national security interests and food crop usage  continue to receive legislative  industry and public attention 
this attention could result in future legislation  regulation and or administrative action that could adversely affect our business 
any inability to address these requirements and any regulatory or policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the production of our products will depend on the availability of feedstock  especially sugarcane 
agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies and regulations 
governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry  such as taxes  tariffs  duties  subsidies  incentives and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products  can influence the planting of certain crops  the location and size of crop production  whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded  the volume and types of imports and exports  and the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials 
future government policies may adversely affect the supply of feedstocks  restrict our ability to use sugarcane or other feedstocks to produce our products  and negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations 
we may incur significant costs complying with environmental laws and regulations  and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business and such materials are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials both in the us and overseas 
although we have implemented safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and related waste products in an effort to comply with these laws and regulations  we cannot be sure that our safety measures will prevent accidental injury or contamination from the use  storage  handling or disposal of hazardous materials 
in the event of contamination or injury  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that violations of environmental  health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error  accident  equipment failure or other causes 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and the failure to comply with past  present  or future laws could result in the imposition of fines  third party property damage  product liability and personal injury claims  investigation and remediation costs  the suspension of production  or a cessation of operations  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault 
environmental laws could become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations  which could impair our research  development or production efforts and harm our business 
a decline in the price of petroleum and petroleum based products may reduce demand for many of our renewable products and may otherwise adversely affect our business 
we anticipate that most of our renewable products  and in particular our fuels  will be marketed as alternatives to corresponding petroleum based products 
if the price of oil falls  we may be unable to produce products that are cost effective alternatives to petroleum based products 
declining oil prices  or the perception of a future decline in oil prices  may adversely affect the prices we can obtain from our potential customers or prevent potential customers from entering into agreements with us to buy our products 
during sustained periods of lower oil prices we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 
our revenues and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
as a result  comparing our results of operations on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
factors that could cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate include achievement  or failure  with respect to technology  product development or manufacturing milestones needed to allow us to enter identified markets on a cost effective basis  delays or greater than anticipated expenses associated with the completion or commissioning of new production facilities  or the time to ramp up and stabilize production following completion of a new production facility  impairment of assets based on shifting business priorities and working capital limitations  disruptions in the production process at any manufacturing facility  losses associated with producing our products as we ramp to commercial production levels  failure to recover value added tax vat that we currently reflect as recoverable in our financial statements eg  due to failure to meet conditions for reimbursement of vat under local law  the timing  size and mix of sales to customers for our products  increases in price or decreases in availability of feedstock  the unavailability of contract manufacturing capacity altogether or at reasonable cost  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  gains or losses associated with our hedging activities  fluctuations in the price of and demand for sugar  ethanol  and petroleum based and other products for which our products are alternatives  seasonal variability in production and sales of our products  competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  unanticipated expenses associated with changes in governmental regulations and environmental  health and safety requirements  reductions or changes to existing fuel and chemical regulations and policies  departure of executives or other key management employees resulting in transition and severance costs  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income  business interruptions such as earthquakes and other natural disasters  our ability to integrate businesses that we may acquire  risks associated with the international aspects of our business  and changes in general economic  industry and market conditions  both domestically and in our foreign markets 
in addition  nearly all of our revenue through the third quarter of came from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  with the remainder coming from collaborations and government grants and  more recently  sales of our renewable products 
in the third quarter of  we transitioned out of the ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline business 
we do not expect to be able to replace much of the revenue lost as a result of this transition  particularly in while we continue our efforts to establish a renewable products business 
as part of our operating plan for  we are reducing our cost structure by improving efficiency in our operations and reducing non critical expenditures 
these efforts have included  and may include in the future  reductions to our workforce and adjustments to the timing and scope of planned capital expenditures 
due to the factors described above  among others  the results of any quarterly or annual period may not meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors and may not be meaningful indications of our future performance 
loss of key personnel  including key management personnel  and or failure to attract and retain additional personnel could delay our product development programs and harm our research and development efforts and our ability to meet our business objectives 
our business involves complex  global operations across a variety of markets and requires a management team and employee workforce that is knowledgeable in the many areas in which we operate 
as we build our business  we will need to hire additional qualified research and development  management and other personnel to succeed 
the process of hiring  training and successfully integrating qualified personnel into our operation  in both the us and brazil  is a lengthy and expensive one 
the market for qualified personnel is very competitive because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our technology and anticipated products  particularly in brazil 
our failure to hire and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to meet our research and development and business objectives and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the loss of any key member of our management or key technical and operational employees  or the failure to attract or retain such employees could prevent us from developing and commercializing our products for our target markets and executing our business strategy 
we also may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology and other technology based businesses  particularly in the renewable chemicals and fuels area  or due to the availability of personnel with the qualifications or experience necessary for our business 
in addition  reductions to our workforce as part of cost saving measures may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key employees 
if do not maintain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we may experience staffing constraints that will adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our collaborators and customers in a timely fashion or to support our internal research and development programs and operations 
in particular  our product and process development programs are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical and operational personnel 
competition for such personnel from numerous companies and academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to do so on acceptable terms 
all of our employees are at will employees  which mean that either the employee or we may terminate their employment at any time 
growth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  expansion of our business as we continue to make efforts to develop and bring our products to market 
we have grown from employees at the end of to at march  our growth and diversified operations have placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure 
in particular  continued growth could strain our ability to manage multiple research and development programs  operate multiple manufacturing facilities around the world  develop and improve our operational  financial and management controls  enhance our reporting systems and procedures  recruit  train and retain highly skilled personnel  develop and maintain our relationships with existing and potential business partners  maintain our quality standards  and maintain customer satisfaction 
managing our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources 
if we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted 
our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates 
our commercial success will depend substantially on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate legal protection for our technologies and product candidates in the us and other countries 
as of march   we had issued us and foreign patents and pending us and foreign patent applications that were owned by or licensed to us 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates  as we deem appropriate 
however  we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion  or at all 
our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products or technologies 
in addition  the patent positions of companies like ours are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of patent claims has emerged to date in the us and the landscape is expected to become even more uncertain in view of recent rule changes by the patent and trademark office  or uspto  the introduction of patent reform legislation in congress and recent decisions in patent law cases by the us supreme court 
in addition  we obtained certain key us patents using a procedure for accelerated examination recently implemented by the uspto which requires special activities and disclosures that may create additional risks related to the validity or enforceability of the us patents so obtained 
the patent situation outside of the us is even less predictable 
as a result  the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty 
moreover  we cannot be certain whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications  we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others will independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  any of our or our licensors patents will be valid or enforceable  any patents issued to us or our licensors will provide us with any competitive advantages  or will be challenged by third parties  we will develop additional proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others will have an adverse effect on our business 
we do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents 
even if patents are issued  they may not be sufficient to protect our technology or product candidates 
the patents we own or license and those that may be issued in the future may be challenged  invalidated  rendered unenforceable  or circumvented  and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages 
in particular  us patents we obtained using the uspto accelerated examination program may introduce additional risks to the validity or enforceability of some or all of these specially obtained us patents if validity or enforceability are challenged 
moreover  third parties could practice our inventions in territories where we do not have patent protection or in territories where they could obtain a compulsory license to our technology where patented 
such third parties may then try to import products made using our inventions into the us or other territories 
additional uncertainty may result from potential passage of patent reform legislation by the us congress  legal precedent by the us federal circuit and supreme court as they determine legal issues concerning the scope and construction of patent claims and inconsistent interpretation of patent laws by the lower courts 
accordingly  we cannot ensure that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents  or even if issued  predict the breadth  validity and enforceability of the claims upheld in our and other companies patents 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in certain foreign countries where the local laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the us or may provide  today or in the future  for compulsory licenses 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
moreover  others may independently develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar to  or superior to  our technologies 
if that happens  we may need to license these technologies  and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  if at all  which could cause harm to our business 
we rely in part on trade secrets to protect our technology  and our failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
we rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology  particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to maintain and protect 
our strategy for contract manufacturing and scale up of commercial production requires us to share confidential information with our international business partners and other parties 
our product development collaborations with third parties  including with total  require us to share confidential information  including with employees of total who are seconded to amyris during the term of the collaboration 
while we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets  our or our business partners employees  consultants  contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors 
enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
in addition  foreign courts are sometimes less willing than us courts to protect trade secrets 
if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge  methods and know how  we would not be able to assert our trade secrets against them 
we require new employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting arrangement with us 
these agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
these agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property 
nevertheless  our proprietary information may be disclosed  or these agreements may be unenforceable or difficult to enforce 
additionally  trade secret law in brazil differs from that in the us which requires us to take a different approach to protecting our trade secrets in brazil 
some of these approaches to trade secret protection may be novel and untested under brazilian law and we cannot guarantee that we would prevail if our trade secrets are contested in brazil 
if any of the above risks materializes  our failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
third parties may misappropriate our yeast strains 
third parties  including contract manufacturers  sugar and ethanol mill owners  other contractors and shipping agents  often have custody or control of our yeast strains 
if our yeast strains were stolen  misappropriated or reverse engineered  they could be used by other parties who may be able to reproduce the yeast strains for their own commercial gain 
if this were to occur  it would be difficult for us to challenge and prevent this type of use  especially in countries where we have limited intellectual property protection or that do not have robust intellectual property law regimes 
if we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights of third parties  litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our future products 
our commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and without breaching any agreements we have entered into with regard to our technologies and product candidates 
we cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to conduct our business 
our industry spans several sectors  including biotechnology  renewable fuels  renewable specialty chemicals and other renewable compounds  and is characterized by the existence of a significant number of patents and disputes regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
because patent applications can take several years to issue  there may currently be pending applications  unknown to us  that may result in issued patents that cover our technologies or product candidates 
we are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies filed by  and issued to  third parties 
the existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
if we wish to make  use  sell  offer to sell  or import the technology or compound claimed in issued and unexpired patents owned by others  we will need to obtain a license from the owner  enter into litigation to challenge the validity of the patents or incur the risk of litigation in the event that the owner asserts that we infringe its patents 
if patents containing competitive or conflicting claims are issued to third parties and these claims are ultimately determined to be valid  we may be enjoined from pursing research  development  or commercialization of products  or be required to obtain licenses to these patents  or to develop or obtain alternative technologies 
if a third party asserts that we infringe upon its patents or other proprietary rights  we could face a number of issues that could seriously harm our competitive position  including infringement and other intellectual property claims  which could be costly and time consuming to litigate  whether or not the claims have merit  and which could delay getting our products to market and divert management attention from our business  substantial damages for past infringement  which we may have to pay if a court determines that our product candidates or technologies infringe a third party patent or other proprietary rights  a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies or future products unless the holder licenses the patent or other proprietary rights to us  which it is not required to do  and if a license is available from a third party  such third party may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents or proprietary rights 
the industries in which we operate  and the biotechnology industry in particular  are characterized by frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
many biotechnology companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage 
if any of our competitors have filed patent applications or obtained patents that claim inventions also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the relevant patent regulatory agency to determine priority of invention and  thus  the right to the patents for these inventions in the us these proceedings could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable 
even if successful  an interference proceeding may result in loss of certain claims 
our involvement in litigation  interferences  opposition proceedings or other intellectual property proceedings inside and outside of the us  to defend our intellectual property rights or as a result of alleged infringement of the rights of others  may divert management time from focusing on business operations and could cause us to spend significant resources  all of which could harm our business and results of operations 
many of our employees were previously employed at universities  biotechnology  specialty chemical or oil companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying monetary damages  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel and be enjoined from certain activities 
a loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our product candidates  which could severely harm our business 
even if we are successful in defending against these claims  litigation could result in substantial costs and demand on management resources 
we may need to commence litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  which would divert resources and management time and attention and the results of which would be uncertain 
enforcement of claims that a third party is using our proprietary rights without permission is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
significant litigation would result in substantial costs  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us and would divert management attention from our business objectives 
in addition  an adverse outcome in litigation could result in a substantial loss of our proprietary rights and we may lose our ability to exclude others from practicing our technology or producing our product candidates 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the legal systems of certain countries  particularly certain developing countries  do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection  particularly those relating to biotechnology and or bioindustrial technologies 
this could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights 
proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
moreover  our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate 
our products subject us to product safety risks  and we may be sued for product liability 
the design  development  production and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
our potential products could be used by a wide variety of consumers with varying levels of sophistication 
although safety is a priority for us  we are not always in control of the final uses and formulations of the products we supply or their use as ingredients 
our products could have detrimental impacts or adverse impacts we cannot anticipate 
despite our efforts  negative publicity about amyris  including product safety or similar concerns  whether real or perceived  could occur  and our products could face withdrawal  recall or other quality issues 
in addition  we may be named directly in product liability suits relating to our products  even for defects resulting from errors of our commercial partners  contract manufacturers or chemical finishers 
these claims could be brought by various parties  including customers who are purchasing products directly from us or other users who purchase products from our customers 
we could also be named as co parties in product liability suits that are brought against the contract manufacturers or brazilian sugar and ethanol mills with whom we partner to produce our products 
insurance coverage is expensive  may be difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms 
we cannot be certain that our contract manufacturers or the sugar and ethanol producers who partner with us to produce our products will have adequate insurance coverage to cover against potential claims 
any insurance we do maintain may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses  and if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage  our business would be adversely impacted 
in addition  insurance coverage may become more expensive  which would harm our results of operations 
during the ordinary course of business  we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims  which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
from time to time  we may in the ordinary course of business be named as a defendant in lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings 
these actions may seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  worker compensation  employment discrimination  breach of contract  property damages  civil penalties and other losses of injunctive or declaratory relief 
in the event that such actions or indemnities are ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts exceeding our accrued liability  or at material amounts  the outcome could materially and adversely affect our reputation  business and results of operations 
in addition  payments of significant amounts  even if reserved  could adversely affect our liquidity position 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud  in that case  our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud 
in addition  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting 
the process of implementing our internal controls and complying with section is expensive and time consuming  and requires significant attention of management 
we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
in addition  to the extent we create joint ventures or have any variable interest entities and the financial statements of such entities are not prepared by us  we will not have direct control over their financial statement preparation 
as a result  we will  for our financial reporting  depend on what these entities report to us  which could result in us adding monitoring and audit processes and increase the difficulty of implementing and maintaining adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
this may be particularly true where we are establishing such entities with commercial partners that do not have sophisticated financial accounting processes in place  or where we are entering into new relationships at a rapid pace  straining our integration capacity 
additionally  if we do not receive the information from the joint venture or variable interest entity on a timely basis  this could cause delays in our external reporting 
even if we conclude  and our independent registered public accounting firm concurs  that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements 
failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  could reduce the market confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 
in addition  failure to comply with section could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions  including sec action  ineligibility for short form resale registration  the suspension or delisting of our common stock from the stock exchange on which it is listed  and the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common stock  which would further reduce our stock price and could harm our business 
if the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets becomes impaired  it could materially reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income for the year in which the related impairment charges occur 
we apply the applicable accounting principles set forth in the us financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification to our intangible assets including goodwill  which prohibits the amortization of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the in process research and development acquired in a business combination 
we have used the income method  which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization  to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs 
these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size  pricing of similar products  and expected industry trends 
the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate 
these assets are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects  at which time the assets will be amortized over the remaining useful life or written off  as appropriate 
if the carrying amount of the assets is greater than the measures of fair value  impairment is considered to have occurred and a write down of the asset is recorded 
any finding that the value of our intangible assets has been impaired would require us to write down the impaired portion  which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income for the year in which the related impairment charges occur 
as of december   we had a net carrying value of approximately million million in in process research and development and goodwill associated with our acquisition of draths corporation 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations 
in general  under section of the internal revenue code  or code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  to offset future taxable income 
if the internal revenue service challenges our analysis that our existing nols are not subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes  or if we undergo an ownership change  our ability to utilize nols could be limited by section of the code 
future changes in our stock ownership  some of which are outside of our control  could result in an ownership change under section of the code 
furthermore  our ability to utilize nols of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations 
for these reasons  we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the nols carryforward as of december   even if we attain profitability 
loss of government contract revenues could impair our research and development efforts 
in  we were awarded an integrated bio refinery grant from the us department of energy  or doe 
the terms of this grant make funds available to us to leverage and expand our existing emeryville  california  pilot plant and support laboratories to develop us based production capabilities for renewable fuels and chemicals derived from sweet sorghum 
in  we entered into a technology investment agreement with the defense advanced research projects agency darpa  under which we are performing certain research and development activities funded in part by darpa 
generally  these agreements have fixed terms and may be terminated  modified or recovered by the government agency under certain conditions such as failure to comply with detailed reporting and governance processes or failure to achieve milestones 
under these agreements  we are also subject to audits  which can result in corrective action plans and penalties up to and including termination 
if the doe or darpa terminate their agreements with us  in addition to reducing our revenues  our us based research and development activities could be impaired  which would harm our business 
our headquarters and other facilities are located in an active earthquake zone  and an earthquake or other types of natural disasters affecting us or our suppliers could cause resource shortages and disrupt and harm our results of operations 
we conduct our primary research and development operations in the san francisco bay area in an active earthquake zone  and certain of our suppliers conduct their operations in the same region or in other locations that are susceptible to natural disasters 
in addition  california and some of the locations where certain of our suppliers are located have experienced shortages of water  electric power and natural gas from time to time 
the occurrence of a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  drought or flood  or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems  or any critical resource shortages  affecting us or our suppliers could cause a significant interruption in our business  damage or destroy our facilities  production equipment or inventory or those of our suppliers and cause us to incur significant costs or result in limitations on the availability of our raw materials  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the insurance we maintain against fires  earthquakes and other natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
risks related to ownership of our common stock our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and we expect it to continue to be  subject to significant volatility  and it has declined significantly from our initial public offering price 
as of january   the reported closing price for our common stock on the nasdaq global select market was per share 
market prices for securities of early stage companies have historically been particularly volatile 
such fluctuations could be in response to  among other things  the factors described in this risk factors section or elsewhere in this report  or other factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as fluctuations in our financial results or outlook or those of companies perceived to be similar to us  changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of similar companies  changes in the prices of commodities associated with our business such as sugar  ethanol and petroleum  changes in our capital structure  such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic alliances  regulatory developments in the us  brazil  and or other foreign countries  litigation involving us  our general industry or both  additions or departures of key personnel  investors general perception of us  and changes in general economic  industry and market conditions 
furthermore  stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected  and continue to affect  the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  interest rate changes and international currency fluctuations  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  many companies that have experienced volatility and sustained declines in the market price of their stock have become subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters 
as of march  our executive officers and directors and their affiliates including total together held approximately of our outstanding common stock  total held approximately of our outstanding common stock  and our next two largest holders of outstanding common stock after total maxwell mauritius pte 
ltd 
and biolding investment sa  each of whom has a designee on our board of directors together held approximately of our outstanding common stock 
this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders 
also  these stockholders  acting together  will be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as mergers  consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets 
consequently  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  including a merger  consolidation or other business combination involving us  or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control  even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us  our business or our market  or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us  our business  our market or our competitors 
if any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely  or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors  our stock price would likely decline 
if any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  certain of our equipment leases and credit facilities currently restrict our ability to pay dividends 
consequently  investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 
investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 
anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could impair a takeover attempt 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions include staggered board of directors  authorizing the board to issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock  authorizing the board to amend our bylaws and to fill board vacancies until the next annual meeting of the stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  our directors and officers  eliminating the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings  and requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals 
section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits  subject to some exceptions  business combinations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder  which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of or more of a delaware corporation voting stock  for a three year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
we have agreed to opt out of section through our certificate of incorporation  but our certificate of incorporation contains substantially similar protections to our company and stockholders as those afforded under section  except that we have agreed with total that it and its affiliates will not be deemed to be interested stockholders under such protections 
in addition  we have an agreement with total  which provides that  so long as total holds at least of our voting securities  we must inform total of any offer to acquire us or any decision of our board of directors to sell our company  and we must provide total with information about the contemplated transaction 
in such events  total will have an exclusive negotiating period of fifteen business days in the event the board of directors authorizes us to solicit offers to buy amyris  or five business days in the event that we receive an unsolicited offer to purchase us 
this exclusive negotiation period will be followed by an additional restricted negotiation period of ten business days  during which we are obligated to continue to negotiate with total and will be prohibited from entering into an agreement with any other potential acquirer 
these and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws that became effective upon the completion of our initial public offering under delaware law and in our agreement with total could discourage potential takeover attempts  reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions

we are using our proprietary synthetic biology platform to design microbes  primarily yeast  and use them as living factories in established fermentation processes to convert plant sourced sugars into renewable hydrocarbons 
we are developing  and  in some cases  already commercializing  products from these hydrocarbons in several target markets  including cosmetics  lubricants  flavors and fragrances  polymers and plastic additives  home and personal care products  and transportation fuels 
we call these no compromise products because we design them to perform comparably to or better than currently available products 
we have been applying our industrial synthetic biology platform to provide alternatives to a broad range of petroleum sourced products 
we have focused our development efforts on the production of biofene  our brand of renewable farnesene  a long chain  branched liquid hydrocarbon molecule 
using biofene as a first commercial building block molecule  we are developing a wide range of renewable products for our target markets 
while our platform is able to utilize a wide variety of feedstocks  we are focusing our large scale production plans primarily on the use of brazilian sugarcane as our feedstock because of its abundance  low cost and relative price stability 
we have also produced biofene from other feedstocks such as sugar beets  corn dextrose  sweet sorghum and cellulosic sugars 
our first purpose built  large scale biofene production plant commenced operations in southeastern brazil in december this plant in brotas  in the state of s o paulo  is adjacent to an existing sugar and ethanol mill  para so bioenergia 
we have also advanced initial construction of a second large scale production plant in brazil  located at the usina s o martinho sugar and ethanol mill also in the state of s o paulo  which we intend to complete when production economics support start up of that plant 
to satisfy initial commercial demand for our products until our own facilities are operating  we have leveraged contract manufacturing capabilities of established companies 
our business strategy is to focus our direct commercialization efforts on higher value  lower volume markets while moving lower margin  higher volume commodity products  including our fuels and base oil lubricants products  into joint venture arrangements with established industry leaders 
we believe this approach will permit access to the capital and resources necessary to support large scale production and global distribution for our large market commodity products 
our initial renewable products efforts have been focused on cosmetics  niche fuel opportunities  fragrance oils  and farnesene for liquid polymers 
total relationship in june  we entered into a collaboration agreement with total 
this agreement provided for joint collaboration on the development of products through the use of our synthetic biology platform 
in connection with this agreement  total invested million in our equity 
in november  we entered into an amendment of the collaboration agreement with total with respect to development and commercialization of biofene for diesel 
this represented an expansion of the initial collaboration with total  and established a global  exclusive collaboration for the development of biofene for diesel and a framework for the creation of a joint venture to manufacture and commercialize biofene for diesel 
in addition  a limited number of other potential products were subject to development for the joint venture on a non exclusive basis 
in july  we entered into a further amendment of the collaboration agreement with total that expanded total investment in the biofene collaboration  incorporated the development of certain joint venture products for use in diesel and jet fuel into the scope of the collaboration  and changed the structure of the funding from total to include a convertible debt mechanism 
under the new agreements  we issued senior unsecured convertible notes to total for an aggregate of million in new cash in the third quarter of total may decide to provide further funding at annual decision points in mid and upon completion of the research and development program  we and total would form a joint venture company that would have exclusive rights to produce and market renewable diesel and or jet fuel 
should total decide not to pursue commercialization  under certain conditions  it is eligible to recover up to million  payable in march  in the form of cash or in the form of common stock at a conversion price of per share or  for notes issued in  a lower price as determined under the march letter agreement as described below 
in connection with a private placement of our common stock that occurred in december  total elected to participate by exchanging approximately million of its million in senior unsecured convertible debt outstanding for  shares at the purchase price in this private placement of per share 
as such  million of the outstanding million in senior unsecured convertible debt was cancelled 
in march  we entered into a letter agreement with total under which total agreed to waive its right to cease its participation in our fuels collaboration at the july decision point referenced above and committed to proceed with the july funding tranche of million subject to our satisfaction of the relevant closing conditions for such funding in the securities purchase agreement 
as consideration for this waiver and commitment  we agreed to reduce the conversion price for the senior unsecured convertible promissory notes to be issued in connection with such funding from per share to a price per share equal to the greater of i the consolidated closing bid price of our common stock on the date of the letter agreement  plus  and ii per share  provided that the conversion price will not be reduced by more than the maximum possible amount permitted under the nasdaq rules such that the new conversion price would require us to obtain stockholder consent  and grant total a senior security interest in our intellectual property  subject to certain exclusions and subject to release by total when we and total enter into final documentation regarding the establishment of the fuels jv 
in addition to the waiver by total described above  total also agreed that  at our request and contingent upon us meeting our obligations described above  it would pay advance installments of the amounts otherwise payable at the july closing 
specifically  if we request such advance installments  subject to certain closing conditions and delivery of certifications regarding our cash levels  total is obligated to fund million no later than may   and an additional million no later than june   with the remainder funding on the original july closing date 
contract manufacturing in and  to support our initial commercial production of biofene  we entered into contract manufacturing agreements with various contract manufacturing partners 
we also established contract manufacturing relationships to support conversion of biofene into finished chemical products 
under the terms of the associated contract manufacturing agreements  we provided necessary equipment for the manufacturing of products  over which we retained ownership 
during and  we reimbursed contract manufacturers for an aggregate of million in expenditures related to the modification of their facilities 
we recorded these costs as facility modification costs in other assets and amortized them as an offset against purchases of inventory 
certain of our contract manufacturing agreements have also imposed fixed purchase commitments on us  regardless of production volumes 
in january  we entered into a production service agreement with glycotech under which glycotech performs finishing steps to convert biofene into squalane  diesel  base oils for industrial lubricants  and other products 
in addition  in july  we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with albemarle under which albemarle is to provide toll manufacturing services at its facility in south carolina and we are obligated to reimburse albemarle for capital expenditures related to facility modifications required for the services 
in february  we entered into an amended and restated agreement with albemarle  which superseded the original contract manufacturing agreement with albemarle 
the term of the new agreement continues through december  the agreement includes certain obligations for us to pay fixed costs totaling million  of which million and million are payable in and  respectively 
in addition  fixed costs of million per quarter are payable in if we exercise our option to have product manufactured in the facility in the agreement also includes variable pricing during the contract term 
we may seek to enter into additional contract manufacturing arrangements 
we expect to work with third parties specializing in particular industries to convert biofene by simple chemical processes and initially to sell it primarily in the forms of squalane  diesel  base oils for industrial lubricants  and other products 
beginning in march  we initiated a plan to shift production capacity from the contract manufacturing facilities to amyris owned plants that were then under construction 
as a result  we evaluated our contract manufacturing agreements and recorded a loss of million related to million in facility modification costs and million of fixed purchase commitments in the first quarter of we recognized additional charges of million and million  respectively  in the third and fourth quarter of associated with losses on fixed purchase commitments 
we computed the loss on facility modification costs and fixed purchase commitments using the same lower of cost or market approach that is used to value inventory 
the computation of the loss on firm purchase commitments is subject to several estimates  including cost to complete and the ultimate selling price of any of our products manufactured at the relevant production facilities  and is therefore inherently uncertain 
we also recorded a loss on write off of production assets of million related to amyris owned production equipment at contract manufacturing facilities in the three months ended march  we will continue to evaluate the potential for losses in future periods based on updated production and sales price assumptions 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of scale up costs to support our production of biofene derived products that are included within cost of products sold 
these scale up costs include the contract manufacturing cost related to production of biofene derived products and the finishing of biofene into finished products 
we continue to commit significant resources to our production process in advance of our achieving full commercial production volume 
as only a portion of our production costs varies with our revenue  our production costs will be greater than our revenue until we achieve significant product volume 
we anticipate that our production costs will decrease as we continue to improve our processes and increase throughput 
sales and revenue to commercialize our initial biofene derived product  squalane  for sale to cosmetics companies for use as a moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics and other personal care products  we have entered into marketing and distribution agreements with a number of distributors since june as an initial step towards commercialization of biofene based diesel  we have entered into agreements with several bus operators in s o paulo  brazil 
our diesel fuel is supplied to br distribudora  a division of petrobras  which in turn blends our product with petroleum diesel and sells to a number of bus operators including santa brigida  the largest bus fleet operator in s o paulo 
for the industrial lubricants market  in june we established a joint venture with cosan for the worldwide development  production and commercialization of renewable base oils 
we have also entered into agreements to sell biofene and its derivatives directly to various potential customers  including with m g for use in plastics  with kuraray for use in production of polymers  with michelin for use in tires  with firmenich and givaudan for ingredients for the flavors and fragrances market  and with method for use in home and personal care products 
production and sale of our products pursuant to any of these relationships will depend on the achievement of contract specific technical  development and commercial milestones 
since inception through december   we have recognized million in revenue  primarily from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline 
we transitioned out of the ethanol and ethanol blended business during the third quarter ended september  we do not expect to be able to replace much of the revenues lost in the near term as a result of this transition  particularly in while we continue our efforts to establish our renewable products business 
financing in  we completed multiple financings involving loans and convertible debt and equity offerings 
in february  we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of million and raised million from an offering of senior unsecured convertible promissory notes 
in may  we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of million 
in july  we completed a sale of million in a senior unsecured convertible promissory note for cash proceeds of million and our repayment of million in previously provided research and development funds and  in september  we completed a sale of an additional senior unsecured convertible promissory note for additional cash proceeds of million 
in december  we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of million and the cancellation of million worth of outstanding senior unsecured convertible promissory notes we previously issued to total in exchange for approximately million shares of common stock 
under the december purchase agreement and related documents  the purchase of a portion of the shares  representing million of the proceeds from that transaction  was not settled until january cash received as of december  in the december financing  net of the note conversion and the january settlement  was million 
liquidity we have incurred significant losses in each year since our inception and believe that we will continue to incur losses and negative cash flow from operations into at least as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations related to purchase commitments  as well as capital and operating leases 
as of december   our debt totaled million  of which million matures within the next twelve months 
in addition  our debt agreements contain various covenants  including restrictions on business that could cause us to be at risk of defaults 
in march  we signed a collaboration agreement that included a funding component  and obtained a commitment letter from total with respect to additional convertible note funding as described above  and we expect to use amounts received under these arrangements to fund our operations 
furthermore  we are expecting additional funding in from collaborations  equity or debt offerings  or combinations of these sources 
our operating plan contemplates securing a portion of this additional funding in the second quarter of however  as of the date of this filing  we have not yet secured this additional funding 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional financing  or if other expected sources of funding are delayed or not received  we would take actions to support our liquidity needs that could have a material negative impact on our ability to continue our business as currently contemplated 
see liquidity and capital resources below in this section for additional detail regarding these contingency plans and their potential effects on our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant areas of management s judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we currently recognize revenues from the sale of farnesene derived products  from the delivery of collaborative research services and from government grants 
through the third quarter of  we also sold ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline under short term agreements and in spot transactions at prevailing market prices 
revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if sales arrangements contain multiple elements  we evaluate whether the components of each arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
application of revenue recognition standards requires subjective determination and requires management to make judgments about the fair values of each individual element and whether it is separable from other aspects of the contractual relationship 
for each source of revenues  we apply the above revenue recognition criteria in the following manner product sales starting in the second quarter of  we commenced sales of farnesene derived products 
through the third quarter of  we also sold ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline under short term agreements and in spot transactions at prevailing market prices 
revenues are recognized  net of discounts and allowances  once passage of title and risk of loss have occurred  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have also been met 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are recorded as revenues 
shipping costs are included in cost of products sold 
such charges were not significant in any of the periods presented 
grants and collaborative research services revenues from collaborative research services are recognized as the services are performed consistent with the performance requirements of the contract 
in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate over the research term  we recognize revenues using the proportionate performance method based upon actual efforts to date relative to the amount of expected effort to be incurred by us 
when up front payments are received and the planned levels of research services do not fluctuate over the research term  revenues are recorded on a ratable basis over the arrangement term  up to the amount of cash received 
when up front payments are received and the planned levels of research services fluctuate over the research term  revenues are recorded using the proportionate performance method  up to the amount of cash received 
where arrangements include milestones that are determined to be substantive and at risk at the inception of the arrangement  revenues are recognized upon achievement of the milestone and is limited to those amounts whereby collectibility is reasonably assured 
government grants are made pursuant to agreements that generally provide cost reimbursement for certain types of expenditures in return for research and development activities over a contractually defined period 
revenues from government grants are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred  provided that the conditions under which the government grants were provided have been met and only perfunctory obligations are outstanding 
under a government contract signed in june  we will receive funding based on achievement of program milestones and accordingly revenues are recognized using the proportionate performance method based upon actual efforts to date relative to the amount of expected effort to be incurred  up to the amount of verified payable milestones 
consolidations we have interests in certain joint venture entities that are variable interest entities or vies 
determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity may require judgment in assessing i whether an entity is a variable interest entity and ii if we are the entity s primary beneficiary and thus required to consolidate the entity 
to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we evaluate whether we have i the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology  product supply  operations services  equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances 
our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment 
impairment of long lived assets we assess impairment of long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment and test long lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  or expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the fair value of the asset  which is calculated as the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the carrying amount is determined not to be recoverable and exceeds fair value  which is determined on a discounted cash flow basis 
we make estimates and judgments about future undiscounted cash flows and fair values 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flow attributable to a long lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
our estimates of anticipated cash flows could be reduced significantly in the future 
as a result  the carrying amounts of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
we recorded losses on write off of production assets of million during the year ended december  there were no such losses on write off of production assets recorded in the years ended december  and inventories inventories  which consist of farnesene derived products  ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
in the quarter ended september   we sold our remaining inventory of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline as we transitioned out of this business 
we evaluate the recoverability of our inventories based on assumptions about expected demand and net realizable value 
if we determine that the cost of inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value  we record a write down equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
if actual net realizable values are lower than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could negatively impact our operating results 
if actual net realizable values are more than those projected by management  we may have favorable operating results when products that have been previously written down are sold in the normal course of business 
we also evaluate the terms of our agreements with our suppliers and establish accruals for estimated losses on adverse purchase commitments as necessary  applying the same lower of cost or market approach that is used to value inventory 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from our business combinations 
intangible assets are comprised primarily of in process research and development ipr d 
we make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations and asset acquisitions 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the ipr d acquired in a business combination 
we have used the income method  which applies a probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization  to the estimated future net cash flows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs 
these projections are based on factors such as relevant market size  pricing of similar products  and expected industry trends 
the estimated future net cash flows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate 
these assets are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects  at which time the assets will be amortized over the remaining useful life or written off  as appropriate 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review 
when required  a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment 
we evaluate our intangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased licenses and permits and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we will reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we have not recognized any impairment charges on our intangible assets through december  stock based compensation stock based compensation cost for rsus is measured based on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation cost for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights is estimated at the grant date and offering date  respectively  based on the fair value of our common stock using the black scholes option pricing model 
we amortize the fair value of the employee stock options on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
the measurement of nonemployee stock based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest  and the resulting change in value  if any  is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations during the period the related services are rendered 
there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if different assumptions had been used  the fair value of the equity instruments issued to nonemployee consultants could have been significantly different 
in future periods  our stock based compensation expense is expected to change as a result of our existing unrecognized stock based compensation still to be recognized and as we issue additional stock based awards in order to attract and retain employees and nonemployee consultants 
significant factors  assumptions and methodologies used in determining fair value we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our equity awards 
the black scholes option pricing model requires inputs such as the expected term of the grant  expected volatility and risk free interest rate 
further  the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation that we are required to record as an expense 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 
the fair value of employee stock options was estimated using the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  expected dividend yield risk free interest rate expected term in years expected volatility expected term is derived from a comparable group of publicly listed companies that has a similar industry  life cycle  revenue  and market capitalization and the historical data on employee exercises 
expected volatility is derived from a combination of historical volatility for our stock and the historical volatilities of a comparable group of publicly listed companies within our industry over a period equal to the expected term of our options because we do not yet have a long trading history 
risk free interest rate is the market yield currently available on united states treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the option s expected term 
expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero as we have not paid  and do not anticipate  declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own stock based compensation on a prospective basis and incorporating these factors into the black scholes option pricing model 
each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant management judgment to determine 
if  in the future  we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  and  therefore  should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term  the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly 
higher volatility and longer expected terms generally result in an increase to stock based compensation expense determined at the date of grant 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provisions for income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we recognize a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
we apply the provisions of fasb guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we assess all material positions taken in any income tax return  including all significant uncertain positions  in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities 
assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position s sustainability and the tax benefit to be recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of each balance sheet date  unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed  and we will determine whether i the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and ii the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment 
judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available 
embedded derivatives related to convertible notes embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the underlying debt instrument ie host are accounted for and valued as a separate financial instrument 
we evaluated the terms and features of our convertible notes payable and identified a compound embedded derivative a conversion option that contains a make whole interest provision requiring bifurcation and accounting at fair value because the economic and contractual characteristics of the embedded derivative met the criteria for bifurcation and separate accounting due to the conversion option containing a make whole interest provision  that requires cash payment for forgone interest upon a change of control 
we estimate the fair value of the compound embedded derivative using a black scholes valuation model that combines expected cash outflows with market based assumptions regarding risk adjusted yields  stock price volatility  probability of a change of control and the trading information of our common stock into which the notes are convertible 
the change in the fair value of the bifurcated compound derivative is primarily related to the change in price of the underlying common stock and is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as other income expense 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues years ended december  year to year change percentage change dollars in thousands revenues product sales grants and collaborations revenue total revenues our total revenues decreased by million to million in with such reduction resulting primarily from decreases in product sales 
revenue from product sales decreased by million to million primarily from lower sales of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline purchased from third parties which accounted for million of the reduction  with a decrease in gallons sold and an increase in average selling price per gallon compared to we sold million gallons of ethanol and million gallons of reformulated ethanol blended gasoline in the compared to million gallons of ethanol and million gallons of reformulated ethanol blended gasoline sales in the prior year 
product sales of our farnesene derived products increased million in compared to the prior year 
grants and collaborations revenue in increased by million compared to the prior year primarily due to the revenue recognized upon the amendment of our collaboration agreement with total as described in more detail in financial statements and supplementary data note balance sheet components  which resulted in the recognition of approximately million in collaboration revenue  partially offset by a decline in other collaboration revenue of million 
nearly all of our revenues to date have come from the sale of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline with the remainder coming from renewable products as well as from collaborations and government grants 
we transitioned out of the ethanol and ethanol blended gasoline business during the third quarter of we do not expect to be able to replace much of the revenue lost in the near term as a result of this transition  particularly in while we continue our efforts to establish a renewable products business 
cost and operating expenses years ended december  year to year change percentage change dollars in thousands cost of products sold loss on purchase commitments and write off of production assets nm research and development sales  general and administrative total cost and operating expenses nm not meaningful cost of products sold cost of products sold consists primarily of cost of purchased ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  terminal fees paid for storage and handling  transportation costs between terminals and changes in the fair value of derivative commodity instruments 
starting in the second quarter of  our cost of products sold also included production costs of farnesene derived products  which included cost of raw materials  amounts paid to contract manufacturers and period costs including inventory write downs resulting from applying lower of cost or market inventory valuations 
cost of farnesene derived products sold also includes certain costs related to the scale up in production of such products 
our cost of products sold decreased by million to million in compared to the prior year 
we had a decrease of million in costs of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline purchased from third parties primarily due to a decline in product volume partially offset by an increase in average unit cost 
this decrease in cost of products sold for ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline was partially offset by an increase in product costs of farnesene derived products of million compared to the prior year as we scale up our renewable operations 
we transitioned out of our ethanol and gasoline business in the quarter ended september   which resulted in a reduction of cost of products sold 
as we are now operating our own large scale biofene production plant in brotas  in the state of s o paulo  brazil as of december  we will have a scale up of production from this facility and the associated manufacturing costs 
as we develop cost efficient manufacturing in our first production facility  we expect to seek to work selectively with other brazilian sugar and ethanol producers to build additional facilities adjacent to their existing mills  thereby reducing the capital required to establish and scale our production operations 
we expect our cost per unit of products sold associated with farnesene derived products to decline if and when we achieve full scale commercial production at our large scale manufacturing facility 
we are not able to predict when or if this will occur 
cost of products sold associated with loss on purchase commitments and write off of production assets beginning in march  we initiated a plan to shift a portion of our production capacity from contract manufacturing facilities to amyris owned plants that were then under construction 
as a result  we evaluated our contract manufacturing agreements and  in the first quarter of  recorded a loss of million related to facility modification costs and fixed purchase commitments 
we also recorded an impairment charge of million in the three months ended march  related to amyris owned equipment at contract manufacturing facilities  based on the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value 
we recognized additional charges of million and million  respectively  in the third and fourth quarter of associated with losses on fixed purchase commitments 
we computed the loss on facility modification costs and fixed purchase commitments using the same approach that is used to value inventory the lower of cost or market value 
the computation of the loss on firm purchase commitments is subject to several estimates  including the ultimate selling price of any of our products manufactured at the relevant production facilities  and is therefore inherently uncertain 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses decreased by million in over the prior year  primarily as a result of overall lower spending 
the decreases were attributable to a million reduction in expenses associated with completions of certain outsourced process development projects  a million decrease in outsourced services resulting from completion of certain phases of our government grants project  million reduction in outside consulting expenses  a million decrease in personnel related expenses associated with lower headcount  and a million decrease in travel related expenses and other overhead expenses 
research and development expenses included stock based compensation expense of million in compared to million in sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses decreased by million in compared to the same period of the prior year 
the decrease is attributed primarily to a million reduction in spend for consulting and professional service fees and a million decrease in travel related expenses partially offset by a million increase in personnel related expenses associated with severance and transition costs and higher stock based compensation 
sales  general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense of million and million during and  respectively 
other income expense years ended december  year to year change percentage change dollars in thousands other income expense interest income interest expense other income  net total other income expense total other expense increased by approximately million to million in compared to the prior year 
the increase in total other expense was related primarily to higher interest expense of million associated with increased borrowings to fund our operations including capital expenditures for the coming year 
other income  net for the year ended december  included a gain of million attributable to the change in fair value of a compound embedded derivative liability associated with our senior unsecured convertible promissory notes issued to total which was partially offset by a million expense recognized for the fair market value of a currency interest swap derivative liability  a million loss on the extinguishment of the million debt associated with the december private placement and a million realized loss on foreign currency transactions 
no corresponding amounts related to these transactions were recognized during the year ended december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues years ended december  year to year change percentage change dollars in thousands revenues product sales grants and collaborations revenue total revenues our total revenue increased by million to million in from million in primarily as a result of increases in product sales 
revenue from product sales increased by million to million primarily from sales of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline purchased from third parties in  resulting primarily from an increase in average selling price per gallon and an increase in gallons sold over due primarily to an increase in demand from existing customers

to support production of our products in contract manufacturing and dedicated production facilities  we have incurred  and we expect to continue to incur  capital expenditures as we invest in these facilities 
we plan to continue to seek external debt financing from us and brazilian sources to help fund our investment in these contract manufacturing and dedicated production facilities 
we expect to fund our operations for the foreseeable future with cash and investments currently on hand  with cash inflows from collaboration and grant funding  cash contributions from product sales  and with new debt and equity financing 
our planned working capital needs and our planned operating and capital expenditures for are dependent on significant inflows of cash from existing collaboration partners  as well as additional funding from new collaborations  equity or debt offerings  credit facilities or loans  or combinations of these sources 
we will continue to need to fund our research and development and related activities and to provide working capital to fund production  storage  distribution and other aspects of its business

liquidity 
we have incurred significant losses in each year since our inception and believe that we will continue to incur losses and negative cash flow from operations into at least as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we have significant outstanding debt and contractual obligations related to purchase commitments  as well as capital and operating leases 
as of december   our debt totaled million  of which million matures within the next twelve months 
in addition  our debt agreements contain various covenants  including restrictions on business that could cause us to be at risk of defaults 
in march  we signed a collaboration agreement that included a funding component  and obtained a commitment letter from total with respect to additional convertible note funding as described above under overview total relationship  and we expect to use amounts received under these arrangements to fund our operations 
furthermore  we are expecting additional funding in from collaborations  equity or debt offerings  or combinations of these sources 
our operating plan contemplates securing a portion of this additional funding in the second quarter of however  as of the date of this filing  we have not yet secured this additional funding 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional financing  or if other expected sources of funding are delayed or not received  we would take the following actions as early as the second quarter of to support our liquidity needs through the remainder of and into effect significant headcount reductions in the us and in brazil  particularly with respect to both general and administrative employees and other employees not connected to critical or contracted activities 
shift our focus to existing products and customers with significantly reduced investment in new product and commercial development efforts 
reduce our expenditures for third party contractors  including consultants  professional advisors and other vendors 
suspend operations at our pilot plants and demonstration facilities 
reduce or delay uncommitted capital expenditures  including non essential lab equipment and information technology projects 
the contingency cash plan contemplating these actions is designed to save us an estimated million to million over the next twelve months 
implementing this plan could have a material negative impact on our ability to continue our business as currently contemplated  including  without limitation  delays or failures in our ability to achieve planned production levels  develop and commercialize products within planned timelines or at planned scales  and continue other core activities 
furthermore  any inability to scale back operations as necessary  and any unexpected liquidity needs  could create pressure to implement more severe measures 
such measures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet contractual requirements  including obligations to maintain manufacturing operations  and increase the severity of the consequences described above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity market prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates as described below 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our outstanding debt obligations 
we generally invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms 
accordingly  our interest income fluctuates with short term market conditions 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of money market funds and certificates of deposit  all of which are highly liquid investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal 
additionally  as of december   of our outstanding debt is in fixed rate instruments 
foreign currency risk most of our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and  therefore  our revenues are not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk 
the functional currency of our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary in brazil is the local currency brazilian real in which recurring business transactions occur 
we do not use currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts permanently invested in our foreign subsidiary 
the amount we consider permanently invested in our foreign subsidiary and translated into us dollars using the year end exchange rate is million at december  and million at december  this increase between and is due to additional capital contributions made during  which are partially offset by the depreciation of the brazilian real versus the us dollar and an increase in accumulated deficit of our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary in brazil 
the potential loss in fair value  which would principally be recognized in other comprehensive income loss  resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted brazilian real exchange rates is million and million for and  respectively 
actual results may differ 
we make limited use of derivative instruments  which includes currency interest swap agreements to manage the company exposure to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate related to the company banco pine sa loan

the swap arrangement exchanges the principal and interest payments under the banco pine loan entered into in july for alternative principal and interest payments that are subject to adjustment based on fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and brazilian real 
the swap has a fixed interest rate of 
this arrangement hedges the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and brazilian real 
commodity price risk our primary exposure to market risk for changes in commodity prices currently relates to our purchases of sugar feedstocks 
when possible  we managed our exposure to this risk primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements 
through the third quarter of  we also had commodity market risk related to our purchases of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline in which we used standard derivative commodity instruments to hedge the price volatility of ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline  principally through futures contracts 
however  as of september   we transitioned out of that business and no longer purchase any ethanol and reformulated ethanol blended gasoline or use standard derivative commodity instruments 
the changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded on the balance sheet and recognized immediately in cost of products sold 
we recognized a loss of million  million and million  as the change in fair value for the years ended december   and  respectively see note to our consolidated financial statements
