item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding our financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends that may impact our future performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto 
overview we provide conceptual design  technology  engineering  procurement  fabrication  construction and commissioning services to customers in the energy  petrochemical and natural resource industries 
our reporting segments are comprised of our three business sectors steel plate structures  project engineering and construction  and lummus technology 
we continue to have a broad diversity within the entire energy project spectrum  with approximately of our revenue coming from projects outside the us and approximately of our december  backlog comprised of projects outside the us the geographic mix of our revenue will continue to evolve consistent with changes in our backlog mix  as well as shifts in future global energy demand 
we currently anticipate investment in energy processes projects and storage structures will remain strong in many parts of the world 
investments across the natural gas value chain  specifically lng and gas processing  continue to increase and we are experiencing increases in petrochemical activity 
with respect to technology  we are continuing to experience good petrochemical market conditions and increasing refining activity 
we offer our customers a range of contracting options  including cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  which has both cost reimbursable and fixed price characteristics 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we generally perform our services in exchange for a price that consists of reimbursement of all customer approved costs and a profit component  which is typically a fixed rate per hour  an overall fixed fee or a percentage of total reimbursable costs 
under fixed price contracts  we perform our services and execute our projects at an established price 
the timing of our revenue recognition may be impacted by the contracting structure of our contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts  or hybrid contracts with a more significant cost reimbursable component  generally provide our customers with greater influence over the timing of when we perform our work  and accordingly  such contracts often result in less predictability with respect to the timing of our revenue 
fixed price contracts  and hybrid contracts with a more significant fixed price component  tend to provide us with greater control over project schedule and the timing of when work is performed and costs are incurred  and accordingly  when revenue is recognized 
our december  backlog distribution was comparable to our december  distribution of approximately cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  and lummus technology 
our backlog going into was approximately cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  and lummus technology 
we anticipate that approximately billion to billion approximately to of our consolidated december  backlog will be recognized as revenue during our steel plate structures and project engineering and construction backlog comprised approximately billion and billion  respectively  of our consolidated december  backlog 
this compares to billion and billion  respectively  at december  the composition of this combined backlog by end market at december  was approximately lng including low temp and cryogenic  gas processing  oil sands  refining  and petrochemical and other end markets 
our december  lng backlog was primarily concentrated in the asia pacific region and we anticipate significant opportunities will continue to be derived from this region  in addition to russia and north america 
our gas processing projects were primarily concentrated in the us and the asia pacific region  where we anticipate continued strength 
our oil sands backlog was derived from canada and we anticipate opportunities will continue from this region 
the majority of our refining related backlog was derived from south america 
lummus technology comprised million of our consolidated december  backlog and consists of technology licenses  engineering services  catalysts and specialized heat transfer equipment for the refining  gas processing and petrochemical industries 
equity earnings relate to our owned chevron lummus global clg joint venture and are generated from technology licenses  engineering services and catalysts  primarily for the refining industry 
we have more than projects in backlog  which are being executed in over countries 
these projects vary in size from less than one hundred thousand dollars in contract value to over three billion dollars  with varying durations that can exceed five years 
the differing types  sizes  and durations of our projects  combined with their geographic diversity and stages of completion  often results in fluctuations in our quarterly sector results as a percentage of sector revenue 
in addition  the relative contribution of each of our sectors  and selling and administrative expense fluctuations  will impact our quarterly consolidated results as a percentage of consolidated revenue 
selling and administrative expense fluctuations are primarily impacted by our stock based compensation costs  which are recognized predominantly in the first quarter of each year due to the timing of stock awards and the immediate expensing of awards for participants that are eligible to retire 
although quarterly variability is not unusual in our project oriented business  we are currently not aware of any fundamental change in our sector backlog or business that would give rise to future operating results that would be significantly different from our recent historical norms 

table of contents results of operations our new awards  revenue and income from operations by reporting segment were as follows years ended december  in thousands of total of total of total new awards steel plate structures project engineering and construction lummus technology total new awards of total of total of total revenue steel plate structures project engineering and construction lummus technology total revenue of revenue of revenue of revenue income from operations steel plate structures project engineering and construction lummus technology total income from operations versus consolidated results new awards new awards represent the value of new project commitments received during a given period and are included in backlog until work is performed and revenue is recognized  or until cancellation 
our new awards may vary significantly each reporting period based upon the timing of our major new project commitments 
during  new awards were billion  compared to billion for new awards for were comprised of billion for steel plate structures  billion for project engineering and construction  and million for lummus technology  compared to billion  billion and million  respectively  for new awards for included epc services and module fabrication for an oil sands expansion project in canada approximately billion combined  a gas conditioning award in the asia pacific region approximately million  a petrochemical project in the us approximately million  engineering services for an offshore platform in the uk approximately million  and scope increases on our lng mechanical erection project in the asia pacific region approximately billion and refinery project in colombia approximately million 
new awards for included the award of our lng mechanical erection approximately billion and lng storage tank approximately million projects in the asia pacific region 
see segment results below for further discussion 
backlog backlog at december  was approximately billion  compared to billion at december   reflecting awards exceeding revenue in each of our sectors 
for  our non us dollar denominated backlog was increased by approximately million due to the weakening of the us dollar  primarily against the australian dollar and colombian peso 
while currency fluctuations can cause significant variations in our reported backlog  these fluctuations have not resulted in significant variations in our operating results 
revenue revenue for was billion  representing an increase of million compared with revenue increased million for steel plate structures  million for project engineering and construction and million for lummus technology 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in construction activities on our large lng mechanical erection project  and various lng tank projects  in the asia pacific region approximately million combined  refinery project in colombia approximately million  and gas processing projects in the us and asia pacific region approximately million combined 
revenue from our colombian refinery project was approximately million and million approximately and of our total revenue for and  respectively 
see segment results below for further discussion 
gross profit gross profit was million of revenue for  compared to million of revenue for the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to higher revenue for all three sectors 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to higher margins achieved in our steel plate structures and lummus technology sectors  partly offset by the project engineering and construction sector representing a larger portion of our consolidated revenue 
see segment results below for further discussion 

table of contents selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expense was million of revenue for  compared to million of revenue for the absolute dollar increase for was due primarily to increases associated with our business development efforts  global administrative support  and incentive plans collectively approximately million  with the remaining increase being predominantly inflationary in nature around the world 
other operating expense income  net other operating expense for was million compared to million for the increase in net other operating expense for was primarily attributable to transaction costs associated with the shaw acquisition approximately million  partially offset by net gains on the sale of miscellaneous property and equipment 
equity earnings equity earnings were million for  compared to million for the increase was attributable to higher earnings from our unconsolidated clg joint venture within lummus technology  primarily attributable to higher refining activity in the current year 
income from operations income from operations was million of revenue for  compared to million of revenue during the increase in absolute value and as a percentage of revenue for both periods was due to the reasons noted above 
see segment results below for further discussion 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was million for  compared to million for our results were impacted by interest and fees related to financing commitments associated with the shaw acquisition approximately million and net incremental interest expense associated with uncertain tax positions and the timing of tax payments resulting from our periodic income tax compliance reviews approximately million  partially offset by a lower term loan balance million 
our results were impacted by the resolution of uncertain tax positions  which resulted in the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and associated accrued interest approximately million  partially offset by additional interest expense related to the timing of tax payments approximately million 
interest income was million for  compared to million for the change versus the prior year was commensurate with the average cash balances during the applicable periods 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million of pre tax income  compared to million of pre tax income for our rate increased by approximately over the prior year due to a greater percentage of current year income being earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions  primarily outside the us  and increased by due to non deductible shaw acquisition related costs 
the increase was partly offset by the current year benefiting by approximately over the prior year from the utilization of previously unrecognized net operating losses and credits  primarily in the netherlands  and approximately from a greater portion of pre tax earnings being attributable to our noncontrolling interest partners 
our tax rate may experience fluctuations due primarily to changes in the geographic distribution of our pre tax income 
for  we anticipate increased activity in higher tax rate jurisdictions  primarily canada  australia and the us net income attributable to noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests are primarily associated with our lng mechanical erection and gas processing projects in the asia pacific region and certain operations in the middle east 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was million for  compared to million for the change versus the prior year period was commensurate with the level of applicable operating results for the aforementioned projects in the asia pacific region 
we expect to experience an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in future periods  primarily from additional progress on our lng mechanical erection project 
segment results steel plate structures new awards new awards were billion for  compared to billion for new awards for included scope increases on our lng mechanical erection project approximately billion  a gas storage facility award in the asia pacific region approximately million  a petrochemical storage facility award in the middle east approximately million  petroleum storage tank work in the us approximately million and canada approximately million  oil sands related work in canada approximately million  and various standard storage tank awards throughout the world 
new awards for included our lng mechanical erection project approximately billion and an lng storage tank project approximately million in the asia pacific region  an aluminum complex storage tank project in the middle east approximately million  and storage tank work in canada approximately million and the bahamas approximately million 
revenue revenue was billion for  representing an increase of million compared with our revenue benefited from increased construction activity on our lng mechanical erection project  and various lng tank projects  in the asia pacific region approximately million combined  and progress on storage tank work in the us and canada approximately million  but was partly offset by the wind down of various projects in the caribbean and middle east approximately million 

table of contents income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  compared to million of revenue for our results benefited from higher revenue volume and related leverage of our operating costs  and savings on various projects that were nearing completion in the asia pacific region and caribbean approximately million combined  partly offset by a higher percentage of our revenue being derived from our cost reimbursable lng mechanical erection project in the asia pacific region  and the prior year realizing better margins in the middle east approximately million and benefiting from savings on various projects in the us and canada approximately million combined

lummus technology new awards new awards were million for  compared to million for the increase from the prior year was primarily attributable to significant petrochemical license awards in  including an aromatics complex in india  petrochemical plants in malaysia and russia  propane dehydrogenation units in the us and china  and ethane crackers in the us  and a higher volume of heat transfer awards  including heaters for various refineries in russia 
the award activity for and was primarily located in the asia pacific region  north america  russia and india 
revenue revenue was million for  representing an increase of million compared with the increase for was due primarily to increased catalyst activity resulting from normal variations in the timing of execution of our backlog 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue  compared to million of revenue for our results benefited primarily from increased revenue volume and higher margins on our heat transfer and catalyst activity 
versus consolidated results new awards backlog during  new awards were billion  compared with billion for the increase in new awards over the comparable prior year period was primarily the result of including the awards of a large lng mechanical erection project and lng tank project for steel plate structures in the asia pacific region approximately billion combined 
see segment results below for further discussion 
backlog at december  was approximately billion  compared with billion at december   reflecting the multi year projects awarded in for  our non us dollar denominated backlog was reduced by approximately million due to the strengthening of the us dollar  primarily against the australian dollar and colombian peso 

table of contents revenue revenue for was billion  representing a million increase from revenue increased million for steel plate structures  million for project engineering and construction and million for lummus technology 
the increase in revenue for was primarily due to an increase in construction activities on our large steel plate structure and project engineering and construction projects that were awarded in see segment results below for further discussion 
gross profit our gross profit was million of revenue for  compared with million of revenue for the decrease in gross profit percentage  relative to the comparable prior year period  was due to a higher percentage of our revenue being derived from our significant cost reimbursable backlog and higher precontract costs approximately million associated with increased bid activity  partly offset by better cost recoveries from increased engineering and construction activities 
selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expense for was million of revenue  compared with million of revenue for the absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to the impact of our december  acquisition of the remaining interest in cdtech  a previously unconsolidated lummus technology joint venture investment  and increases associated with our incentive plans and global business development efforts 
the results of cdtech were consolidated and included in our lummus technology results for the aforementioned increases totaled approximately million for  with the remaining increase being predominantly inflationary in nature 
other operating expense income other operating expense for was million  versus income of million for  primarily reflecting the net impact of gains and losses from the sale of miscellaneous property and equipment 
equity earnings equity earnings were million for  compared to million for the decrease was due to our consolidation of the results of cdtech for all of approximately million  partly offset by higher earnings from our unconsolidated clg joint venture approximately million due to increased catalyst sales 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue during the increase in absolute value and decrease as a percentage of revenue were due to the reasons noted above 
see segment results below for further discussion 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was million for  compared to million for approximately million of the decrease was due to the resolution of uncertain tax positions in  which resulted in the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and associated accrued interest 
the remaining decrease was primarily due to our lower term loan balance 
interest income was million for  compared to million for the increase was due to higher average cash balances and higher rates of return 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million of pre tax income  compared with million of pre tax income for our tax rate benefited by approximately during both and from the utilization of previously unrecognized net operating losses 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for was million compared to million for the change compared with was commensurate with the level of applicable operating results for such projects  primarily in the middle east 
segment results steel plate structures new awards new awards were billion for  compared with billion for new awards during included the lng mechanical erection and storage tank awards in the asia pacific region noted above approximately billion combined  an aluminum complex storage tank project in the middle east approximately million  oil sands work in canada and refining storage tank work in the bahamas 
new awards for included lng storage tanks and other work in the asia pacific region in excess of million and three storage tanks in the middle east approximately million combined 
revenue revenue was billion for  representing an increase of million compared with approximately million of this increase was attributable to increased construction activity on our large lng tank project in the asia pacific region and storage tank project in the middle east both awarded in 
the remaining increase was primarily related to other storage projects in the middle east and asia pacific 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue for our results generally benefited from higher revenue volume and better cost recoveries from increased construction activities  partly offset by higher precontract and selling and administrative costs approximately million combined  and the period benefiting from a million claim settlement in the us and better than anticipated margins on several projects executed in the asia pacific region and the middle east 

table of contents project engineering and construction new awards new awards were billion for  compared with billion for new awards during included the full release of epc services for our oil sands project in canada approximately million  a natural gas processing plant in the us approximately million  engineering design services for offshore platforms in the uk approximately million  front end engineering and design and project management services for a refinery in the middle east  and various scope increases on our gas processing project in the asia pacific region and refining project in colombia 
new awards for included incremental releases for our oil sands project in canada approximately million  a gas processing plant in the us approximately million  engineering services for a floating production  storage and offloading facility in europe approximately million  a gas processing plant in peru approximately million  development services for an lng integrated project in russia  and scope increases on our gas processing project in the asia pacific region and refinery project in colombia  both awarded in revenue revenue was billion for  representing an increase of million compared with our results benefited from an increase in engineering and construction activities on our refinery project in colombia approximately million  increased construction activity on our gas processing projects in the asia pacific region and the us approximately million combined  and increased revenue related to our oil sands work in canada 
these increases were partially offset by a lower volume of lng work associated with the completion of projects in south america  europe and the us approximately million combined and less refinery work in the us income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue for our results generally benefited from higher revenue volume and better cost recoveries from increased engineering activities  but were impacted by a higher percentage of revenue being derived from our cost reimbursable projects in the asia pacific region and colombia  and higher precontract and selling and administrative costs approximately million combined 
while our results were impacted by facility realignment costs in the us  comparable charges were recognized in the prior year period 
lummus technology new awards new awards were million for  compared with million for the increase from was primarily due to the consolidation and subsequent growth of cdtech approximately million  higher petrochemical license awards  including a grassroots ethylene plant in russia and an award for the license and engineering design of a propane dehydrogenation unit and polypropylene plant in kazakhstan 
the award activity for was primarily located in the asia pacific region  north america  middle east and russia 
revenue revenue was million for  representing an increase of million compared with the increase was primarily attributable to the consolidation and subsequent growth of cdtech in approximately million  with the remainder attributable to increased licensing  catalyst and heat transfer revenue 
income from operations income from operations for was million of revenue versus million of revenue for the absolute dollar increase from the prior year was due to increased revenue and the consolidation of cdtech in approximately million combined 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year was primarily due to the consolidation of cdtech and a higher volume of heat transfer revenue in  which generally has lower margins than our licenses  engineering services and catalysts 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december   cash and cash equivalents were million 
operating activities during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  as cash generated from earnings  and dividends received from our equity investments  were offset by an overall increase in working capital 
the increase in working capital resulted from an increase in accounts receivable of million and a net increase in contracts in progress of million  partly offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
these balances fluctuate based on the changing mix of cost reimbursable versus fixed price backlog  as our cost reimbursable projects tend to have a greater working capital requirement 
these balances are also impacted at period end by the timing of accounts receivable collections and accounts payable payments for our large projects 
the increases noted above were primarily due to a greater percentage of our revenue being derived from our large cost reimbursable projects 
investing activities during  net cash used in investing activities was million  as capital expenditures of million were partly offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million 
financing activities during  net cash used in financing activities was million  resulting primarily from share repurchases during the first six months of the year totaling million million shares at an average price of per share  including million to repurchase million shares of our outstanding common stock and million to repurchase million shares associated with stock based compensation related withholding taxes on taxable share distributions 
additionally  cash used in financing activities included a final million payment on our term loan see below  dividends paid to our shareholders of million  financing related payments associated with the shaw acquisition of million  of which approximately million was capitalized and will be expensed prospectively  and distributions to our noncontrolling interest partners of million 
these cash outflows were partly offset by tax benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation costs of million and cash proceeds from the issuance of shares associated with our stock plans of million 

table of contents as discussed below  on december   we issued a series of senior notes the senior notes totaling million  in the aggregate  to fund a portion of the shaw acquisition 
the proceeds from the senior notes were immediately funded into an escrow account on december  and remained restricted from use until the acquisition closing date 
accordingly  these escrowed funds were separately recorded as restricted cash on our balance sheet at december  in addition to the shaw acquisition  we continue to evaluate and selectively pursue other opportunities for additional expansion of our business through acquisition of complementary businesses 
these acquisitions may involve the use of cash or may require further debt or equity financing 
effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents during  our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by million due to the impact of changes in functional currency exchange rates against the us dollar for us dollar cash balances  primarily the euro and australian dollar 
the unrealized gain on our cash and cash equivalents balance resulting from this exchange rate movement is reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income loss oci 
our cash and cash equivalents held in non us dollar currencies are used primarily for project related and other operating expenditures in those currencies  and therefore  our exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is not anticipated to be material 
letters of credit bank guarantees debt surety bonds our primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
capacity under a revolving credit facility is also available  if necessary  to fund operating or investing activities 
we have a four year  billion  committed and unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan  as administrative agent  and bank of america  na bofa  as syndication agent  which expires in july the revolving facility was amended effective december   to allow for the shaw acquisition and related financing as further described in the shaw acquisition related financing section below 
the revolving facility  as amended  has a borrowing sublimit of million and certain financial covenants  including a temporary maximum leverage ratio of beginning at the acquisition closing date  with such maximum declining to its previous level of within six quarters of the acquisition closing date  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  and a minimum net worth level calculated as billion at december  the revolving facility also includes customary restrictions regarding subsidiary indebtedness  sales of assets  liens  investments  type of business conducted and mergers and acquisitions  as well as a trailing twelve month limitation of million for dividend payments and share repurchases subject to certain financial covenants among other restrictions 
at december   we had issued million of letters of credit under the revolving facility  providing million of available capacity under this facility 
such letters of credit are generally issued to customers in the ordinary course of business to support advance payments and performance guarantees  in lieu of retention on our contracts  or in certain cases  are issued in support of our insurance program 
in addition to the revolving facility  at december   we had a million committed and unsecured letter of credit and term loan agreement the lc agreement with bofa  as administrative agent  jpmorgan  and various private placement note investors  which was terminated on february  at december   the lc agreement was fully utilized  however  the letters of credit under the lc agreement were replaced with capacity under our revolving facility upon termination of the lc agreement 
the lc agreement had financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the revolving facility 
at december   we had million remaining on our term loan with jpmorgan  as administrative agent  and bofa  as syndication agent 
interest under the term loan was paid quarterly in arrears and  at our election  was based upon libor plus an applicable floating margin 
however  we had an interest rate swap that provided for an interest rate of approximately  inclusive of the applicable floating margin 
the remaining term loan balance was repaid in november we also have various short term  uncommitted revolving credit facilities the uncommitted facilities across several geographic regions of approximately billion 
these facilities are generally used to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees to customers to support advance payments and performance guarantees in the ordinary course of business or in lieu of retention on our contracts 
at december   we had issued million of letters of credit under the uncommitted facilities  providing billion of available capacity under these facilities 
in addition to providing letters of credit or bank guarantees  we also issue surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to support our contract performance 
during  we had no material borrowings under the revolving facility  lc agreement or uncommitted facilities collectively  the existing facilities 
at december   we were in compliance with all of our restrictive and financial covenants  with a leverage ratio of  a fixed charge coverage ratio of  and net worth of billion 
our ability to remain in compliance with our lending facilities could be impacted by circumstances or conditions beyond our control  including  but not limited to  the delay or cancellation of projects  changes in foreign currency exchange or interest rates  performance of pension plan assets  or changes in actuarial assumptions 
further  we could be impacted if our customers experience a material change in their ability to pay us  if the financial institutions associated with our lending facilities were to cease or reduce operations  or if there is a full or partial break up of the european union or its currency  the euro 
see notes and to our financial statements for further discussion of our lending facilities 

table of contents shaw acquisition related financing as more fully described in note to our financial statements  on february  we completed the shaw acquisition for a purchase price of approximately billion  comprised of approximately billion in cash consideration and approximately million in equity consideration 
the cash consideration was funded using approximately billion from existing cash balances of cb i and shaw on the acquisition closing date  and the remainder was funded using billion in debt financing  which consisted of a four year  billion unsecured term loan the acquisition term loan and our million senior notes 
the acquisition term loan was committed on december  by bofa  as administrative agent  and credit agricole corporate and investment bank credit agricole as syndication agent  however  borrowings were not allowed or made until the acquisition closing date  at which time the billion was funded 
the acquisition term loan bears interest at libor plus an applicable floating margin 
annual future maturities for the acquisition term loan are million  million  million  million and million  in    and  respectively  with interest due quarterly 
the senior notes were issued and funded into an escrow account on december   with merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith incorporated  and credit agricole  as administrative agents  however  the funds were restricted from use until the acquisition closing date 
accordingly  the escrowed funds were recorded as restricted cash  and the senior notes were recorded as long term debt  on our balance sheet at december  the senior notes include series a through d  which contain the following terms series a interest due semi annually at a fixed rate of  with principal of  due in december series b interest due semi annually at a fixed rate of  with principal of  due in december series c interest due semi annually at a fixed rate of  with principal of  due in december series d interest due semi annually at a fixed rate of  with principal of  due in december on december   we also entered into a five year  million  unsecured revolving credit facility the second revolving facility with bofa  as administrative agent  and credit agricole  as syndication agent  which expires in february  and has a million borrowing sublimit 
the second revolving facility will supplement our revolving facility and was used to replace million of shaw s existing credit facilities on the acquisition closing date 
however  at december   we had no borrowings or outstanding letters of credit under the second revolving facility as none were permitted until the acquisition closing date 
in addition to the second revolving facility  the uncommitted facilities were used to replace an additional million of shaw s existing credit facilities on the acquisition closing date 
our acquisition term loan  senior notes and second revolving facility collectively  the acquisition facilities include financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the existing facilities and  at december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
shaw acquisition related costs during  we incurred approximately million and million of transaction costs and financing related costs  respectively  which were recognized in other operating expense income  net and interest expense  respectively 
during  we anticipate incurring additional transaction costs and financing related costs related to the shaw acquisition of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  change in control payments of approximately million could be incurred if we take certain actions  including termination or a significant reduction in duties or compensation of certain employees 
at the acquisition closing date  shaw had also incurred approximately million of transaction costs related to existing change in control agreements and the associated change in control payments that were triggered by the shaw acquisition  retention agreements  and investment banking  legal and accounting services 
such costs were or will be paid  at or subsequent to the acquisition closing date  and recorded as goodwill on our acquisition closing date balance sheet 
share issuance agreement on august   we filed a prospectus with the sec  under a previously filed shelf registration statement  which provided for the offer and sale of up to million shares of our common stock shares through july   its expiration date 
we cumulatively offered and sold approximately million shares under the prospectus  however  no shares were sold during shelf registration statement on june   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that expires on june  the shelf registration statement enables us to offer and sell shares of our common stock and issue debt securities collectively  the securities from time to time subsequent to the filing of a prospectus supplement which  among other things  identifies the sales agent  specifies the number and value of securities that may be sold  and provides the time frame over which securities may be offered 

table of contents contractual obligations at december   our contractual obligations were as follows contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases senior notes self insurance obligations pension funding obligations postretirement benefit funding obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations includes approximately million of minimum lease payments that are contractually recoverable through our cost reimbursable projects 
includes interest accruing on our million senior notes discussed above at a weighted average rate of 
represents expected payments associated with our self insurance program 
payments beyond one year have not been included as amounts are not determinable 
represents expected contributions to fund our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
contributions beyond one year have not been included as amounts are not determinable 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into commitments for the purchase of materials and supplies on our projects 
these purchase commitments which are expected to be recovered from our customers are generally settled in less than one year 
we do not enter into long term purchase commitments on a speculative basis for fixed or minimum quantities 
payments for reserved tax contingencies of million are not included as the timing of specific tax payments is not determinable 
other we believe our cash on hand  funds generated by operations  amounts available under our existing facilities and acquisition facilities  and other external sources of liquidity  such as the issuance of debt and equity instruments  will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures  settle our commitments and contingencies as more fully described in note to our financial statements and address our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funding will continue to be available  as our ability to generate cash flow from operations and our ability to access funding under our existing facilities and acquisition facilities at reasonable terms  may be impacted by a variety of business  economic  legislative  financial and other factors  which may be outside of our control 
additionally  while we currently have significant uncommitted bonding facilities  primarily to support various commercial provisions in our contracts  a termination or reduction of these bonding facilities could result in the utilization of letters of credit in lieu of performance bonds  thereby reducing the available capacity under our existing facilities and acquisition facilities 
although we do not anticipate a reduction or termination of the bonding facilities  there can be no assurance that such facilities will continue to be available at reasonable terms to service our ordinary course obligations 
a portion of our pension plans assets are invested in european union government securities  which could be impacted by economic turmoil in europe or a full or partial break up of the european union or its currency  the euro 
however  given the long term nature of pension funding requirements  in the event any of our pension plans including those with investments in european union government securities become materially underfunded from a decline in value of our plan assets  we believe our cash on hand and amounts available under our existing facilities and acquisition facilities would be sufficient to fund any increases in future contribution requirements 
see note to our financial statements for further discussion of our pension plan assets 
we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the normal course of business and we have in place appropriate insurance coverage for the type of work that we perform 
as a matter of standard policy  we review our litigation accrual quarterly and as further information is known on pending cases  increases or decreases  as appropriate  may be recorded 
see note to our financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation  including lawsuits wherein plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos due to work we may have performed 
off balance sheet arrangements we use operating leases for facilities and equipment when they make economic sense  including sale leaseback arrangements 
our sale leaseback arrangements are not material to our financial statements  and we have no other significant off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents new accounting standards see the applicable section of note to our financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our supervisory board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our contracts are awarded on a competitive bid and negotiated basis 
we offer our customers a range of contracting options  including cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  which has both cost reimbursable and fixed price characteristics 
our contract revenue is primarily recognized using the poc method  based on the percentage that actual costs to date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract 
we follow the guidance of financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification revenue recognition topic for accounting policies relating to our use of the poc method  estimating costs  and revenue recognition  including the recognition of profit incentives  unapproved change orders and claims  and combining and segmenting contracts 
we utilize the cost to cost approach as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress 
under the cost to cost approach  the use of estimated costs to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts 
significant estimates that impact the cost to complete each contract are costs of engineering  materials  components  equipment  labor and subcontracts  labor productivity  schedule durations  including subcontract and supplier progress  liquidated damages  contract disputes  including claims  achievement of contractual performance requirements  and contingency  among others 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known  including  to the extent required  the reversal of profit recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress 
due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting  actual results could differ from those estimates 
contract revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for approved change orders and estimated recoveries on unapproved change orders and claims 
we recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent that related costs have been incurred  recovery is probable and the value can be reliably estimated 
profit incentives are generally included in the determination of contract revenue upon achievement of the relevant performance requirements and customer approval 
at december  and  we had unapproved change orders and claims of approximately million and million  respectively  factored into the determination of revenue and estimated costs for a project in our project engineering and construction sector  but had no material profit incentives factored into the determination of revenue 
our recorded unapproved change orders and claims reflect our best estimate of recovery amounts  however  the ultimate resolution and amounts received could differ from these estimates 
with respect to our epc services  our contracts are generally not segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  if each of the epc components is negotiated concurrently or if the pricing of any such services is subject to the ultimate negotiation and agreement of the entire epc contract 
if an epc contract includes both technology and epc services  such contract is segmented between technology and the epc services when the technology scope is independently negotiated and priced 
in some instances  we may combine contracts that are entered into in multiple phases  but are interdependent and include pricing considerations by us and the customer that are impacted by all phases of the project 
otherwise  if each phase is independent of the other and pricing considerations do not give effect to another phase  the contracts will not be combined 
financial instruments we utilize derivative instruments in certain circumstances to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  as described below foreign currency exchange rate derivatives we do not engage in currency speculation  however  we do utilize foreign currency exchange rate derivatives on an on going basis to hedge against certain foreign currency related operating exposures 
we generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges 
therefore  gains and losses exclusive of credit risk and forward points which represent the time value component of the fair value of our derivative positions are included in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings 
changes in the fair value of credit risk and forward points  instruments deemed ineffective during the period and instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges are recognized within cost of revenue 
interest rate derivatives during  our interest rate derivatives were limited to a swap arrangement in place to hedge against interest rate variability associated with our term loan 
the swap arrangement was designated as a cash flow hedge  as its critical terms matched those of the term loan at inception and through november  when we paid the remaining term loan balance of million 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the swap arrangement were included in aoci until the associated underlying exposure impacted our earnings 

table of contents income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted income tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the final realization of deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate jurisdictions 
at december   we had a recorded net deferred tax asset dta of million related to net operating losses nols generated in the uk we also had a valuation allowance against million of uk nols for which we believe it is more likely than not that the nols will not be utilized 
the uk nol dta was recorded primarily in and and relates to losses incurred during those years on two large fixed price projects that were completed in the first quarter of we have had no material release of valuation allowance since it was initially recorded 
on a periodic and ongoing basis we evaluate our recorded u 
k nol and assess the appropriateness of our valuation allowance 
our assessment includes  among other things  the value and quality of backlog  an evaluation of existing and anticipated market conditions  an analysis of historical results and projections of future income  and strategic plans and alternatives for our uk operations 
we consider the impact of these and other factors  including the indefinite lived nature of the uk nols  and determine whether an adjustment to our valuation allowance is required 
based on this analysis  we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our uk nol dta 
in order to realize the uk nol dta  our uk operations will need to generate future taxable income of approximately million 
based on this same analysis and as described above  we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize our uk nols in excess of the amounts recorded 
however  better than anticipated future operating results or a significant increase in backlog could impact our assessment and result in future changes in valuation allowance 
we provide income tax and associated interest reserves  where applicable  in situations where we have and have not received tax assessments 
tax and associated interest reserves are provided in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional tax will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide 
at december  and  our reserves totaled million and million  respectively 
as a matter of standard policy  we continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and as further information is known or events occur  changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within income tax expense and interest expense  respectively 
insurance we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
however  we retain a portion of anticipated losses through the use of deductibles and self insured retentions for our exposures related to third party liability and workers compensation 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims through analysis of historical and projected trends  in conjunction with actuaries and other consultants  and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a hypothetical ten percent change in our self insurance reserves at december  would have impacted our pre tax income by approximately million for recoverability of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is not amortized to earnings  but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually  absent any indicators of impairment 
we are required to review goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units  which we have identified as our three reporting segments 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of our annual impairment assessment  we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
based upon this qualitative assessment  a two phase quantitative assessment was not required to be performed for any of our reporting units 
if  based on future qualitative assessments  the two phase quantitative assessment is deemed necessary  it would require us to allocate goodwill to the applicable reporting unit  compare its fair value to the carrying amount  including goodwill  and then  if necessary  record a goodwill impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess  if any  of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
to the extent a quantitative assessment is required  the implied fair value of each applicable reporting unit would be derived using the discounted cash flow method 
this methodology is based  to a large extent  on assumptions about future events  which may or may not occur as anticipated  and such deviations could have a significant impact on the calculated estimated fair values of our reporting units 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  estimates of future growth rates  discount rates and terminal values of reporting units 
our goodwill balance at december  was million  including million for steel plate structures  million for project engineering and construction and million for lummus technology 
based upon our current goodwill impairment assessment  each of our reporting units continue to have estimated fair values that are substantially in excess of their carrying values 
finite lived identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years  absent any indicators of impairment 
we review tangible and finite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if a recoverability assessment is required  the estimated future cash flow associated with the asset or asset group will be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment exists 
we noted no indicators of impairment in or see note to our financial statements for further discussion regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
one form of exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating financial statements of foreign operations primarily australian dollar  canadian dollar and euro denominated into our reporting currency  which are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in aoci 
we generally do not hedge our exposure to potential foreign currency translation adjustments 
we do not engage in currency speculation  however  we do utilize foreign currency exchange rate derivatives on an on going basis to hedge against certain foreign currency related operating exposures 
we generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges 
therefore  gains and losses exclusive of credit risk and forward points are included in aoci until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings 
changes in the fair value of credit risk and forward points  instruments deemed ineffective during the period and instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges are recognized within cost of revenue and were not material during at december   the notional value of our outstanding forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exchange related operating exposures was million  including net foreign currency exchange rate exposure associated with the purchase of us dollars million  euros million  thai baht million and singapore dollars million 
the total net fair value of these contracts was a loss of approximately million at december  the potential change in fair value for our outstanding contracts resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
this potential change in fair value of our outstanding contracts would be offset by the change in fair value of the associated underlying operating exposures 
interest rate risk during  we continued to utilize a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with our term loan 
the swap arrangement was designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the term loan at inception  and through november when we paid the remaining balance of million 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap were recognized in aoci until the associated underlying exposure impacted our earnings 
other the carrying values of our cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short term nature of these instruments 
at december   the fair value of our million senior notes  which were issued and funded into an escrow account on december   approximated their carrying value 
at december   the fair value of our term loan  based upon the current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturity  approximated its carrying value as interest was based upon libor plus an applicable floating spread and was paid quarterly in arrears 
as noted above  our remaining term loan balance was paid in see note to our financial statements for additional discussion of our financial instruments
