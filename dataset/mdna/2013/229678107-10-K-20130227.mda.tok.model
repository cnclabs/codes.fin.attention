overview cubist strategic intent is to become the leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing therapies for acutely ill patients those in treatment for serious but acute illnesses for days or weeks in hospitals or outpatient acute care settings 
revenue growth we derive most of our revenues from our iv antibiotic  cubicin  which we currently commercialize on our own in the us our worldwide net product revenues represent net us product revenues of cubicin and  beginning in december  entereg  as well as international product revenues  which relate to the payments we receive from international distributors in connection with their commercialization of cubicin 
the cash flow generated from sales of cubicin for the treatment of patients with certain serious infections caused by gram positive bacteria  including mrsa  funds important investments to drive our future growth 
our total revenue growth for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   includes contributions from cubicin net us product revenues  which increased to million primarily due to an increase of approximately in vial shipments and cubicin price increases  
table of contents international product revenues from sales of cubicin by our ex us marketing partners  which increased to million  entereg net us product revenues  which were million 
we re launched entereg  the first and only fda approved therapy to accelerate the time for gi recovery following bowel resection surgery  in january  following our acquisition of adolor in december of  and service revenues of million under our co promotional agreement with optimer for the launch of its acute care therapeutic  dificid 
in  service revenues included a payment of million for the achievement of an annual sales target under the terms of the co promotion agreement and a million payment representing a portion of optimer gross profits on net sales of dificid in the us that exceeded the annual sales target for the first sales year 
our two year agreement with optimer will expire in july late stage clinical pipeline during  we advanced our clinical pipeline as we sought to leverage the acute care focused business model we have created 
as of december   we were enrolling patients in phase clinical trials for three product candidates 
two of these late stage product candidates  assuming successful clinical trial results and approvals  would be used to treat hospitalized patients with serious infections ceftolozane tazobactam an iv antibiotic in development as a potential treatment for certain infections caused by gram negative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa 
we are currently conducting ongoing  global phase clinical trials in cuti and ciai  which began in pseudomonas aeruginosa has been cited as a pathogen of concern by the us congress as well as the idsa due to the levels of multi drug resistance which exist in many hospitals 
the fda recently designated ceftolozane tazobactam as a qualified infectious disease product  or qidp 
as a result of this qualification  ceftolozane tazobactam is eligible for certain incentives  including an accelerated review period upon filing of an nda  and if ceftolozane tazobactam is ultimately approved by the fda  a five year extension of hatch waxman exclusivity 
surotomycin an oral antibiotic in development as a potential treatment for cdad 
we began phase clinical trials of surotomycin in july cdad is a serious disease in the us and many parts of the world  with significant levels of recurrence associated with increasing risk of mortality 
data from our phase clinical trial  as announced in  demonstrated that treatment with surotomycin reduced recurrence by more than when compared with standard of care  oral vancomycin 
in late  the fda designated surotomycin as a qidp  and as a result  surotomycin is also eligible for the same incentives as ceftolozane tazobactam  as discussed above 
bevenopran an oral therapy in development as a potential treatment for oic  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of adolor in december we began a phase long term safety study of bevenopran in oic in late oic is the most common side effect for patients undergoing long term treatment with opioids to relieve chronic pain  such as serious back pain 
we expect to begin enrollment in phase efficacy trials of bevenopran in patients with oic in the first half of assuming clinical trial success and regulatory approval  we believe bevenopran would address an important unmet medical need in the chronic care setting

acquisition of adolor in december  we completed our acquisition of adolor 
under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  we paid adolor stockholders in cash for each share of adolor common stock  or approximately million  in aggregate  which we funded from our existing cash balances 
adolor former stockholders also received one non transferable cpr  which represents the right to receive up to an additional in cash for each share of adolor common stock owned  or up to approximately million in aggregate  which cubist is required to pay upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones  sales milestones or a combination of both  related to bevenopran 
the fair value of the purchase price was estimated to be million and was allocated to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of the ipr d asset related to bevenopran  which we acquired in connection with the acquisition of adolor  was impaired as a result of our decision in the fourth quarter of to deprioritize and delay efforts to develop bevenopran for the eu market 
this decision was based on our current assessment of the regulatory path and the commercial opportunity for oic agents in the eu 
we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the ipr d asset related to bevenopran and recorded contingent consideration income of million during the fourth quarter of to adjust the fair value of the contingent consideration liability

results of operations for the years ended december  and revenues the following table sets forth revenues for the periods presented for the years ended december  change in millions us product revenues  net international product revenues service revenues other revenues total revenues  net product revenues  net cubist net us product revenues included million of sales of cubicin and million of sales of entereg for the year ended december   as compared to million of sales of cubicin and million of sales of entereg for the year ended december  gross us product revenues totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in gross us product revenues was primarily due to i price increases of for cubicin in july  january and july  which resulted in million of additional gross cubicin us product revenues  ii an increase of approximately 
table of contents in vial sales of cubicin in the us  which resulted in higher gross cubicin us product revenues of million  and iii the addition of entereg to our product portfolio in december  which resulted in additional gross us product revenues of million 
gross us product revenues are offset by provisions for the years ended december  and  as follows for the years ended december  change in millions gross us product revenues provisions offsetting us product revenues contractual adjustments governmental rebates total provisions offsetting product revenues us product revenues  net contractual adjustments include pricing and early payment discounts extended to our customers  as well as sales returns and wholesaler distribution fees 
governmental rebates represent estimated amounts for medicaid program rebates and medicare coverage gap discount programs  as well as chargebacks related to b phs and fss drug pricing programs 
the increase in provisions against gross product revenue was primarily driven by increases in chargebacks  pricing discounts and medicaid rebates due to increased us sales of cubicin and the price increases described above 
we expect net revenues from sales of cubicin in the us to continue to increase due primarily to increased vial sales and price increases we may implement 
we also expect an increase in entereg product revenues as a result of targeted efforts by our sales force in the hospital setting 
there are a number of events  trends and uncertainties that are impacting or may impact our revenues from cubicin and entereg and the growth of such revenues 
these events  trends and uncertainties are set forth in the risk factors section in item a of part i to this annual report on form k 
international product revenues are primarily based on sales of cubicin by novartis  our distribution partner in the eu 
international product revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily related to an increase in product sold by novartis and msd japan for their distribution of cubicin in their respective territories 
we expect our international product revenues to increase from as a result of an increase in anticipated sales of cubicin by our international alliance partners 
service revenues service revenues for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
service revenues for the years ended december  and  related to quarterly fees earned under the co promotion agreement with optimer to promote dificid in the us in addition  during the year ended december   we recorded a million payment for the achievement of an annual sales target under the terms of the co promotion agreement and a million payment representing a portion of optimer gross profits on net sales of dificid in the us that exceeded the annual sales target for the first sales year as stipulated in the co promotion agreement 
we expect service revenues to decrease in as compared to  as the arrangement with optimer terminates in july 
table of contents other revenues other revenues for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
other revenues for the year ended december   included a million sales milestone during the year ended december   as a result of novartis achieving a predetermined level of aggregate sales of cubicin to third parties  which we recognized as other revenue upon achievement 
costs and expenses the following table sets forth costs and expenses for the periods presented for the years ended december  change in millions cost of product revenues research and development impairment of ipr d n a contingent consideration selling  general and administrative restructuring charges total costs and expenses cost of product revenues cost of product revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in our cost of product revenues are royalties owed on net sales of cubicin under our license agreement with eli lilly  costs to procure  manufacture and distribute cubicin and entereg  and the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets 
the increase in cost of product revenues of million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is primarily attributable to the increase in sales of cubicin in the us  the addition of entereg to our product portfolio and amortization expense related to the entereg intangible asset 
our gross margin for the years ended december  and  was and  respectively 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage from the year ended december   is primarily due to the gross margin for entereg  which was impacted by million of amortization expense related to the entereg intangible asset 
we expect our gross margin percentage in to be similar to our gross margin percentage in 
table of contents research and development expense the following table contains a breakdown of our research and development expenses for the periods presented for the years ended december  change in millions external expenses marketed products phase programs ceftolozane tazobactam surotomycin n a bevenopran n a earlier stage programs milestone and upfront payments research and development employee related expenses other unallocated internal research and development expenses total research and development program had not reached phase development for the period presented 
for each of our research and development programs  we incur both external and internal expenses 
external expenses include clinical and non clinical activities performed by cros  lab services  purchases of drug product materials and manufacturing development costs 
we track external research and development expenses by individual program  with the phase costs associated with development activities for our three current phase programs identified in the table above 
marketed product expenses include external expenses for post marketing phase trials for cubicin and entereg 
external expenses for earlier stage programs primarily include expenses incurred for cb  as well as costs incurred prior to phase for ceftolozane tazobactam  surotomycin and bevenopran 
milestone and upfront payments included in research and development expense relate to the licensing or purchase of research and development assets that did not qualify as business combinations 
research and development employee related expenses include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense 
other unallocated internal research and development expenses are incurred to support overall research and development activities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is primarily due to i an increase of million in external expenses related to ceftolozane tazobactam as a result of incurring a full year of phase clinical trial expenses for cuti and ciai  in which first patient enrollment commenced in july and december  respectively  ii an increase of million in external expenses related to surotomycin as a result of first patient enrollment in phase clinical trials  which commenced in july  iii an increase of million in external expenses related to bevenopran as a result of the start up of a phase long term safety study in october  and iv an increase of million in employee related expenses due to additional headcount 
we expect research and development expenses to increase by approximately million in the increase in expense is expected to be driven by our phase clinical trial expenses for activities related to ceftolozane tazobactam  surotomycin and bevenopran  including the cost to purchase the 
table of contents material for use in clinical trials  and continued investment in process and development  as well as an increase in headcount 
impairment of ipr d in connection with the acquisition of adolor in december  we acquired an ipr d asset related to bevenopran with an acquisition date fair value of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we made a decision to deprioritize and delay efforts to develop bevenopran for the eu market based on our current assessment of the regulatory path and the commercial opportunity for oic agents in the eu 
as a result of this decision  and in conjunction with our annual impairment test  we updated the fair value estimate of the ipr d asset to incorporate a low probability of pursuing bevenopran in the eu 
we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the ipr d asset to its revised fair value  which was recorded within our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  see note f  fair value measurements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
contingent consideration contingent consideration income was million for the year ended december   and contingent consideration expense was million for the year ended december  this income expense represents the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability relating to remaining amounts potentially payable to calixa former stockholders pursuant to our agreement to acquire calixa in december and to adolor former stockholders pursuant to our agreement to acquire adolor in december the change in the fair value for the year ended december   primarily related to recording contingent consideration income of million with respect to bevenopran during the fourth quarter of as a result of decreasing the probability of achieving a regulatory approval milestone in the eu  which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the cprs owed to the former stockholders of adolor 
this was partially offset by contingent consideration expense for ceftolozane tazobactam related to the time value of money 
the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for the year ended december   primarily relates to achieving the milestones for first patient enrollment in the phase clinical trials of ceftolozane tazobactam for cuti and ciai  increasing the probabilities of success for subsequent associated milestones and recognizing expense related to the time value of money  which resulted in approximately million of contingent consideration expense 
in addition  the probability of enrollment in a phase clinical trial of ceftolozane tazobactam as a potential treatment for habp and vabp was increased  and the resulting fair value of the associated milestone was increased  which resulted in additional contingent consideration expense of million 
contingent consideration expense income may fluctuate significantly in future periods depending on changes in estimates  including probabilities associated with achieving the milestones and the period in which we estimate these milestones will be achieved 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily related to an increase of million in payroll  benefits and other employee related expenses due to an increase in headcount and an increase of million in promotional expenses for entereg and cubicin 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in transaction fees related to the acquisition of adolor in december 
table of contents we expect selling  general and administrative expense in to increase modestly  in the aggregate  primarily due to an increase in salaries  benefits and employee related expenses due to an increase in headcount during  as well as expenses related to patent infringement litigation with hospira related to hospira anda and nda filings 
restructuring expense in connection with our acquisition of adolor  we committed to a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of  which included severance benefits to former adolor employees and execution of a lease termination agreement for adolor operating lease for its facility in exton  pennsylvania  as of december  cubist incurred charges of million in the fourth quarter of related to these activities 
we paid employee related severance of million and the lease termination obligation of million during using our existing cash balances 
the remaining severance payments will be made in the first half of other income expense  net the following table sets forth other income expense  net for the periods presented for the years ended december  change in millions interest income interest expense other income expense total other income expense  net interest expense interest expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the cessation of capitalizing interest as a result of completing construction at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  or hayden  in december  partially offset by the retirement of our notes in june and november see note m  debt  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded contingent consideration income that is not subject to income tax  which decreased the effective tax rate for the year ended december   by approximately 
in addition  the effective tax rate for the year ended december   was impacted by the resolution of uncertain state tax positions in the second quarter of  resulting in the recognition of an million net of federal tax benefit 
the impact of the reversal of uncertain tax positions on the effective tax rate for the year ended december   was approximately 
for the year ended december   the difference between the effective tax rate of and the us federal statutory income tax rate of is primarily due to contingent consideration income recorded in the fourth quarter of and the resolution of uncertain tax positions  as discussed above 
for the year ended december   the difference between the effective tax rate of and the us federal statutory income tax rate of is primarily due to the impact of non deductible contingent consideration expense 
cubist and its subsidiaries file income tax returns with the us federal government and with multiple state and local jurisdictions in the us changes in the effective tax rates from period to period may be significant as they depend on many factors including  but not limited to  changes in circumstances surrounding the need for a valuation allowance  size of our income or loss  or one time activities occurring during the period 
contingent consideration expense related to potential future milestone payments will have a negative impact on our effective tax rate in the year the expense is recognized as it is largely non deductible for tax purposes 
conversely  contingent consideration income will lower our effective tax rate as contingent consideration income is not taxable 
the effective tax rate will include the benefit of the federal research credit  which was extended retroactively through december   by the american taxpayer relief act of  enacted on january  the benefit of the federal research credit will be reflected in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of our effective tax rate would have been reduced by approximately had the credit been effective for the year ended december

commitments and contingencies legal proceedings in february  we received a paragraph iv certification notice letter from hospira notifying us that it had submitted an anda to the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of cubicin  and in may  we received a second paragraph iv certification notice letter from hospira notifying us that it had submitted to the fda an amendment to its anda 
in august  we received a third paragraph iv certification notice letter from hospira notifying us that it had submitted an nda to the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of cubicin 
in march  we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against hospira in response to its anda filing  and in july  we filed a new complaint against hospira in response to hospira amendment to its anda filing 
in september  we filed a patent infringement complaint against hospira in response to its nda filing 
see the intellectual property portfolio section in item of part i of this annual report on form k for additional information 
in april  we entered into a settlement agreement with teva and its affiliates to resolve patent infringement litigation with respect to cubicin 
we originally filed the patent infringement lawsuit in march in response to the february notification to us by teva that it had submitted an anda to the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of cubicin 
the settlement agreement provides for a full settlement and release by both us and teva of all claims that were or could have been asserted in the patent infringement litigation and all resulting damages or other remedies 
among other things  we granted teva a non exclusive  royalty free license to sell a generic daptomycin for injection product in the us beginning on the later of i december   and ii if our daptomycin for injection product receives pediatric exclusivity  june  see the business section in item of part i of this annual report on form k for additional information on the agreement  including  among other things  a summary of the licenses granted under the

contingent consideration adolor if certain regulatory milestones  sales milestones or a combination of both are achieved with respect to bevenopran  we have committed  under the terms of the merger agreement pursuant to which we acquired adolor in december  to make future payments to the former stockholders of adolor 
we granted non transferable cprs to the former stockholders of adolor  which represent the right to receive payments in addition to the upfront purchase price  up to a maximum amount of in cash for each share owned by adolor former stockholders upon achievement of such milestones 
the aggregate remaining  undiscounted amount of contingent consideration that cubist could pay to the former stockholders of adolor under the merger agreement ranges from zero to approximately million 
the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to bevenopran decreased million during the year ended december   primarily due to decreasing the probability of achieving a regulatory milestone in the eu  partially offset by the time value of money 
if the probability of developing bevenopran for the eu market is further decreased or terminated  the contingent consideration liability could be further reduced 
calixa if certain development  regulatory  or commercial milestones are achieved with respect to ceftolozane tazobactam  or other products that incorporate a novel anti pseudomonal cephalosporin  cxa  we have committed  under the terms of the merger agreement pursuant to which we acquired calixa in december  to make future milestone payments to the former stockholders of calixa 
first patient enrollment in phase clinical trials for ciai triggered a million milestone payment that we made to the former stockholders of calixa in january the aggregate remaining  undiscounted amount of contingent consideration that cubist could pay to the former stockholders of calixa under the merger agreement is million  which includes a million milestone payment expected to be triggered in related to first patient enrollment in an open label  phase clinical trial for vabp 
in accordance with accounting for business combinations guidance  contingent consideration liabilities are required to be recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant assumptions primarily relating to expectations regarding the probability of achieving certain development  regulatory  and sales milestones  the expected timing in which these milestones will be achieved and a discount rate 
the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates of fair value 
as of december  and  the contingent consideration related to the adolor and calixa acquisitions are our only financial liabilities measured and recorded using level inputs in accordance with accounting guidance for fair value measurements and represents of the total financial liabilities measured at fair value 
see note f  fair value measurements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period year or less years years more than years total in millions convertible senior notes interest on convertible senior notes royalty payments inventory purchase obligations contingent consideration obligations other purchase obligations other liabilities total contractual cash obligations the convertible senior notes consist of a remaining million aggregate principal amount of our notes  due in november the notes require semi annual interest payments in may and november through maturity 
the royalty payments listed above represent amounts expected to be owed through december   to i eli lilly on sales of cubicin  ii eli lilly and shire on sales of entereg  and iii glaxo on sales of entereg 
committed payments do not reflect the impact of royalties on future sales of cubicin and entereg beyond december   because we are unable to reliably estimate such total cubicin and entereg sales on which royalties would be due 
the inventory purchase obligations listed above primarily represent purchases for the manufacturing of cubicin api by our supplier  acsd  under the amended manufacturing and supply agreement with acsd  as well as payments for converting cubicin api into its finished  vialed and packaged formulation under separate agreements for these services 
the expected payments for minimum inventory purchase obligations have been translated to us dollars using the exchange rate between us dollars and euros at december  the contingent consideration obligation included above represents an amount for which we can reliably estimate the timing and amount of payments expected to be made to i the former stockholders of calixa upon the achievement of certain development milestones with respect to ceftolozane tazobactam in connection with our acquisition of calixa  and ii the former stockholders of adolor upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones with respect to bevenopran 
this contingent consideration obligation has not been probability adjusted or discounted 
the total undiscounted amounts potentially payable to the former stockholders of calixa and adolor  in excess of the amount included in the table above  are million and million  respectively  the payment of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales based milestones 
other purchase obligations listed above primarily represent expected amounts owed to our cros and independent clinical investigators related to clinical trials of candidates in our product pipeline  as well as amounts owed to our third party service provider for the purposes of conducting clinical trials on our behalf related to ceftolozane tazobactam 
other purchase obligations also include expected amounts for future research funding under our collaboration agreements 

table of contents other liabilities listed above primarily represent amounts owed to glaxo as a result of the termination agreement entered into between adolor and glaxo in june adolor agreed to pay glaxo million  of which million was paid in august  payable in annual installments through in exchange for the return to adolor of full commercialization rights to entereg 
in december  we assumed the remaining obligations owed to glaxo as a result of the acquisition of adolor  and in september  we made an annual payment of million to glaxo 
the annual payments included above have not been discounted 
in addition to the commitments discussed above  we have commitments to make potential future milestone payments to third parties under our license and collaboration arrangements totaling approximately billion  which include million for development milestones  million for regulatory milestones and million for sales based milestones 
these milestones primarily include the commencement and results of clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval in various jurisdictions and the future commercial success of development programs  the outcome and timing of which are difficult to predict and subject to significant uncertainty 
in addition to the milestones discussed above  we are obligated to pay royalties on future sales  which are contingent on generating levels of sales of future products that have not been achieved and may never be achieved 
since we are unable to reliably estimate the timing and amounts of such milestone and royalty payments  or whether they will occur at all  these contingent payments have been excluded from the table above 
see note c  business agreements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our license  collaboration and acquisition arrangements 
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of million have also been excluded from the table above due to our inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements  including off balance sheet arrangements as described in sec regulation s k item as such we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  which requires management to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventories  clinical research costs  investments  business combinations  intangible assets and impairment  income taxes  
table of contents stock based compensation  and contingent consideration 
i 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are i sales of cubicin and entereg in the us  ii revenues derived from sales of cubicin by our international distribution partners  iii license fees and milestone payments that are derived from collaboration  license and distribution agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and iv service revenues derived from our promotion and support of dificid 
in all instances  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
multiple element arrangements we account for revenue arrangements with multiple elements entered into or materially modified after january   by separating and allocating consideration in a multiple element arrangement according to the relative selling price of each deliverable 
the selling price of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence is not available 
deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting  provided i a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we entered into the co promotion agreement with optimer in april to co promote dificid in the us the term of the co promotion agreement is approximately two years from the date of first commercial sale of dificid in the us  which occurred in july we assessed the co promotion agreement under the accounting guidance on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
the deliverables under the co promotion agreement with optimer include co promotion of dificid  participation in joint committees and providing medical affairs support for dificid 
each identified deliverable within the arrangement was determined to be a separate unit of accounting  and the performance period of each deliverable was deemed to be the term of the co promotion agreement 
there are no performance obligations extending beyond the term of the arrangement 
as a result  we are recognizing the service fees ratably over the performance period ending july  cubist other existing license and collaboration agreements continue to be accounted for under previously issued revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements 
under this guidance  we recognize non refundable upfront license payments as revenue upon receipt if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered obligations  if any  can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of cubist performance for such undelivered items or services 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations are recorded as deferred revenue once received and generally are recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligation only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered by cubist 
we sell cubicin to international distribution partners based upon transfer price arrangements that are generally adjusted annually  based upon the terms of the agreements 
once our distribution partner sells cubicin to a third party  we may be owed an additional payment or royalty based on a percentage of the net selling price to the third party  less the initial transfer price our partners previously paid us for the product 
under no circumstances would the subsequent adjustment result in a refund to the distribution partner of the initial transfer price 
certain agreements with our distribution partners contain multiple elements in which we have continuing performance obligations 

table of contents in such arrangements in which we determined that the undelivered elements in each arrangement did not have objective evidence of fair value  payments from distribution partners are recorded as deferred revenue 
we amortize deferred revenue over the remaining performance obligation 
milestone payments under our license  collaboration and commercialization agreements  we may be entitled to receive consideration in the form of milestone payments 
consideration for an event that meets the definition of a substantive milestone in accordance with the accounting guidance for the milestone method of revenue recognition is recognized as revenue in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if all of the following conditions are met i the milestone is commensurate with either cubist performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii the consideration relates solely to past performance  and iii the amount of the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms  including other potential milestone consideration  within the arrangement 
otherwise  the milestone payments are not considered to be substantive and are  therefore  deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as cubist completes its remaining performance obligations 
us product revenues  net we maintain a drop ship program under which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users  which are generally hospitals and acute care settings 
we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin or entereg 
this results in sales trending closely to actual hospital and acute care settings purchases 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for returns  chargebacks  discounts  wholesaler management fees  medicaid program rebates and medicare coverage gap discount program rebates in the same period the related sales are recorded 
our return policy allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date of the product 
our estimate of the provision offsetting returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors  including historical experience of actual returns  analysis of the level of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  and re order rates of end users 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin and entereg  our net product sales may be impacted 
we analyze our estimates and assumptions for chargebacks  medicaid program rebates and medicare coverage gap discount program rebate reserves quarterly 
our reserves for chargebacks  medicaid program rebates and medicare rebates represent our estimates of outstanding claims for end user rebate eligible sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received 
our estimates are based on an analysis of customer sales mix data  prior claims history and third party studies to determine which sales may flow through to a rebate or chargeback eligible customer 
effective march   the affordable care act extended medicaid rebates to drug volume issued to medicaid patients whose drug coverage is managed by mcos under individual agreements with states 
we accrue for the expected liability at the time we record the sale  however  the time lag between sale and payment of medicaid and medicare rebates can be lengthy 
in addition  we continue to experience delays in billing by state authorities under the mco plans 
as a result  in any particular period our medicaid and medicare rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

table of contents reserves for medicaid program rebates and medicare coverage gap discount program rebates are included in accrued liabilities and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
reserves for returns  discounts  chargebacks and wholesaler management fees are offset against accounts receivable and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves to vary 
due to the drop ship model under which we currently operate and our experience to date of actual product returns and chargebacks  we do not expect that the differences in these reserves would be material 
if actual results vary with respect to our medicaid reserve  we may need to adjust our estimates  which could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period of adjustment 
ii 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo basis 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels and write down inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory in excess of expected sales requirements and inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications  with a corresponding charge to cost of product revenues 
charges for inventory write downs are not reversed if it is later determined that the product is saleable 
therefore  any such written down inventory would be sold at significantly higher margin 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we dispose of our expired inventory 
inventory that is in excess of the amount expected to be sold within one year is classified as long term inventory and is included in other assets within the consolidated balance sheets 
iii 
clinical research costs we engage external entities such as cros  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
contracts and studies vary significantly in duration and are generally composed of a fixed management fee  variable indirect reimbursable costs and amounts owed on a per patient enrollment basis 
we record costs for clinical study activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each study and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments made by us for research and development activities  including clinical research activities  until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
milestones paid to collaborators are expensed as incurred if the payment is not payment for future services 
we monitor the activity levels and patient enrollment levels of the studies through communication with the service providers  detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of actual expenses against budget  pre approval of any changes in scope and review of contractual terms 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs 
the level of clinical study expense may vary from period to period based on the number of studies that are in process  the duration of each study  the level of patient enrollment  the number of sites involved in each study and the global location of sites 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those that have a significant number of sites  require significantly high patient enrollment rates  have complex patient screening requirements or that span multiple years 
if we receive incomplete or inaccurate information from our third party service providers  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we 
table of contents could record adjustments to prior period accruals that increase or reverse research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
iv 
investments investments with original maturities of greater than days and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with remaining maturities of greater than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long term investments 
our short term and long term investments may include bank deposits  corporate and municipal notes  us treasury securities and federal agency securities 
investments are considered available for sale as of december  and  and are carried at fair value 
in accordance with fair value measurement guidance  we categorize investments within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to estimate fair value  which may be based on observable and or unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect certain market assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy level is determined by asset class based on the lowest level of significant input 
as of december   the fair value estimates for our investments utilize observable inputs and are categorized as level or level of the fair value hierarchy  which is described in note b  accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
investments are initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued using information obtained through a third party pricing service 
the pricing service uses various market inputs to determine value  including trade information  broker or dealer quotes  bids  offers  market interest rates or a combination of these data sources 
we corroborate the prices provided by our third party pricing service by obtaining and analyzing market data from other pricing sources and confirming that the relevant markets are active 
see note e  investments  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
unrealized gains and temporary losses on investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses  dividends and declines in value judged to be other than temporary credit losses are included in other income expense within the consolidated statements of income 
any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and or accreted to interest income within the consolidated statements of income 
v 
business combinations on december   we acquired adolor for total consideration of million  consisting of a cash payment of million and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million 
the transaction was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting 
accordingly  the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value 
transaction costs were expensed as incurred 

table of contents the following table summarizes these estimated fair values in millions december  as adjusted cash investments inventory ipr d entereg intangible asset deferred tax assets goodwill other assets acquired total assets acquired deferred tax liabilities payable to glaxo other liabilities assumed total liabilities assumed total net assets acquired the purchase price allocation was prepared on a preliminary basis and adjusted during the measurement period to reflect information existing at the acquisition date but that became available only post acquisition 
the measurement period adjustments primarily related to certain entereg inventory batches acquired from adolor that were deemed saleable and additional deferred tax assets recorded as a result of the finalization of the internal revenue code  section study performed in connection with the acquisition of adolor nols and the filing of its tax return 
goodwill of million was initially recognized on the date of acquisition and purchase price accounting adjustments of million  which reduced goodwill  were recorded through the measurement period 
none of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 
we acquired commercial entereg inventory and recorded it at its fair value  which required a step up adjustment to recognize the inventory at its expected net realizable value 
the inventory step up is recorded to cost of product revenues within the consolidated statement of income as the related inventory is sold 
we expect to consume substantially all of the entereg api over a remaining period of approximately eight years based on our long range sales projections of entereg 
see note g  inventory  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
of the identifiable assets acquired through our acquisition of adolor  million related to ipr d for bevenopran 
bevenopran is an oral  peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonist currently in development as a potential treatment for oic in patients with chronic  non cancer pain 
cubist initiated a phase long term safety study of bevenopran as a potential treatment for oic in patients with chronic  non cancer pain in october see intangible assets and impairment within this critical accounting policies and estimates section for additional information 
we also recorded million of finite lived intangible assets  as adjusted  related to the rights to entereg 
the fair value of the acquired entereg intangible asset was determined using an income approach  including a discount rate applied to the projected cash flows 
the entereg intangible asset is being amortized using the straight line method over approximately nine years 
estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination requires significant judgment 
the use of different estimates could result in materially different fair values 

table of contents vi 
intangible assets and impairment ipr d upon acquisition  ipr d assets are recorded at their acquisition date fair value 
until the underlying project is completed  these assets are accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets and are subject to impairment testing 
once the project is completed  the carrying value of the ipr d is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
post acquisition research and development expenses related to the ipr d projects are expensed as incurred 
in july  the fasb issued amended accounting guidance for testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the amendments permit a company to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  a company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value  then the company is not required to take further action 
a company also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
cubist would be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
as provided for in the amended guidance  cubist elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and instead performed the quantitative impairment test for its indefinite lived intangible assets 
ipr d is tested for impairment on an annual basis  in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
if ipr d becomes impaired or is abandoned  the carrying value of the ipr d is written down to its revised fair value with the related impairment charge recognized in the period in which the impairment occurs 
if the carrying value of the asset becomes impaired as the result of unfavorable data from any ongoing or future clinical trial  changes in assumptions that negatively impact projected cash flows  or because of any other information regarding the prospects of successfully developing or commercializing our programs  we could incur significant charges in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the projected discounted cash flow models used to estimate the fair values of our ipr d reflects significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate a drug development asset  including probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval  market size and market growth projections  estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to advance our clinical programs to commercialization  estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales  and a discount rate 
the use of different assumptions or changes in assumptions used could result in materially different fair value estimates 
in connection with the acquisition of calixa in december  we identified and recorded million as ipr d assets relating to ceftolozane tazobactam for cuti  ciai  habp and vabp indications 
as of the date of acquisition  the ipr d asset related to ceftolozane tazobactam for habp and vabp had an estimated fair value of million  and the ipr d asset related to ceftolozane tazobactam for cuti and ciai had an estimated fair value of million 
we assessed the fair value of ipr d assets using an income approach  including discounted cash flow models that are probability adjusted for assumptions relating to the development and potential commercialization of 
table of contents ceftolozane tazobactam 
development of ceftolozane tazobactam requires various levels of in house and external testing  clinical trials and approvals from the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it could be commercialized in the us or other territories 
the estimated research and development cost to complete ceftolozane tazobactam  which includes potential development milestones but excludes contingent consideration milestones  ranges from million to million for the cuti and ciai indications and from million to million for the habp and vabp indications 
assuming successful results in clinical trials and regulatory approval  we expect to commercially launch ceftolozane tazobactam with cuti and ciai indications in and with the habp and vabp indications in the estimated costs to complete each ipr d project represent management best estimate of expected costs  but are subject to change based on additional information to be received as development activities advance 
in connection with the acquisition of adolor in december  we also identified and recorded ipr d relating to bevenopran of million 
the fair value of the acquired ipr d asset was determined using an income approach  including a discount rate  applied to the probability adjusted cash flows 
the estimated research and development cost to complete bevenopran ranges from million to million  which includes potential development milestones but excludes contingent consideration milestones 
assuming successful results in clinical trials and regulatory approval  we intend to commercially launch bevenopran in during the fourth quarter of  we made a decision to deprioritize and delay efforts to develop bevenopran for the eu market based on our current assessment of the regulatory path and the commercial opportunity for oic agents in the eu 
as a result of this decision  and in conjunction with our annual impairment test  we updated the fair value estimate of the ipr d asset to incorporate a low probability of pursuing bevenopran in the eu 
we determined the fair value using an income approach  including a discount rate applied to the probability adjusted cash flows  which was deemed to be a level input 
we believe the assumptions are representative of those a market participant would use in estimating fair value 
as of december   the ipr d asset related to bevenopran is our only asset measured and recorded using level inputs in accordance with accounting guidance for fair value measurements and represents approximately of the total assets measured at fair value 
the resulting fair value of the ipr d asset related to bevenopran was million at december  accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the ipr d asset to its revised fair value  which was recorded within our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  we did not recognize any impairment charges related to ipr d during the years ended december  and see note f  fair value measurements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the successful development of new pharmaceutical products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
given these uncertainties  there can be no assurance that our clinical programs will be successfully developed for the pursued indications or  if successfully developed  that these programs will be developed in the timeframes described above 
if such development is not successful or completed in a timely manner or is more expensive than currently anticipated  we may not realize the financial benefits expected from our clinical programs or from the related acquisitions as a whole  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill goodwill totaled approximately million as of december   and relates to our acquisitions of adolor and calixa in december and december  respectively 
goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment within our single reporting unit on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter

we performed step one of the two step goodwill impairment test by assessing the fair value of our reporting unit as compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we determined that the carrying value of our single reporting unit did not exceed its fair value  and therefore  goodwill was not impaired as of december  we did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended december   and other intangible assets other intangible assets consist of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles with finite lives 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from nine to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates and can materially impact our operating results 
other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain long lived assets are impaired 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition 
we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our other intangible assets during the years ended december   and vii 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a deferred tax asset is established for the expected future benefit of nol and credit carryforwards 
a valuation reserve against net deferred tax assets is required if  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accounting for uncertain tax positions  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
any changes to these estimates  based on the actual results obtained and or a change in assumptions  could impact our income tax provision in future periods 
during the year ended december   we reversed million of gross uncertain tax positions primarily due to an agreement reached with the massachusetts tax authorities in related to the filing of amended state tax returns 
interest and penalty charges  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as a provision for income tax in the consolidated statement of income

stock based compensation we expense the fair value of employee stock based compensation using the straight line recognition method over the employees service periods  which are generally the vesting period of the equity award 
in order to determine the fair value of option awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  estimated option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock  which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based on the exercise behavior and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns  if applicable 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of pre vesting cancellations for terminated employees 
we believe that our estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
see note k  employee stock benefit plans  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

contingent consideration each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain acquisitions to their fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as contingent consideration income 
changes in contingent consideration result from changes in the assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related milestones  the estimated timing in which the milestones are achieved and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability 
contingent consideration may change significantly as development of our clinical programs in certain indications progress and additional data is obtained  impacting our assumptions 
the assumptions used in estimating fair value require significant judgment 
the use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value

recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued amended accounting guidance for reporting accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments require a company to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  a company is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  a company is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued amended accounting guidance for testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the amendments permit a company to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not 
table of contents that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this guidance for the year ended december  the adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as provided for in the amended guidance  we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and instead performed the quantitative impairment test for our indefinite lived intangible assets 
see note b  accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  which may include money market instruments  bank deposits  corporate and municipal notes  us treasury securities and federal agency securities 
these investments are primarily denominated in us dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
we currently own securities that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective in managing our cash is to preserve capital and provide adequate liquidity to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive securities are held for trading purposes 
the potential change in the fair value of our fixed rate investments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a decrease in fair value of million and million on our fixed rate investments at december  and  respectively 
in november  we retired the remaining million outstanding amount of our notes 
see note m  debt  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
as of december  and  the fair value of the notes was estimated by us to be million and million  respectively 
we determined the estimated fair value of the notes by using quoted market rates 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  the fair value of our notes would decrease approximately million and million at december  and  respectively
