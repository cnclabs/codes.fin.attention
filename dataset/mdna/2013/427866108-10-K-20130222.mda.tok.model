item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview results for the year ended december  were strong with increases in net sales  earnings per share and profitability despite continued macroeconomic challenges 
net sales increased compared with due to net price realization and volume increases in the united states and key international markets as we continued our focus on core brands and innovation 
advertising expense increased for the year supporting core brands along with new product launches 
net income and earnings per share diluted also increased at greater rates than our long term growth targets 
the investments we have made in both productivity and cost savings resulted in a business model that is more efficient and effective  enabling us to deliver predictable  consistent and achievable marketplace and financial performance 
we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations and our financial position remains solid 
adjusted non gaap financial measures our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for each of these non gaap financial measures  we are providing below the most directly comparable gaap measure  a reconciliation of the differences between the non gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure  an explanation of why our management believes these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors  and additional purposes for which we use these non gaap measures 
we believe that the disclosure of these non gaap measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year to year operating results 
we exclude the effects of certain items from income before interest and income taxes ebit  net income and income per share diluted common stock eps when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally  and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business 
we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business 
adjusted non gaap financial measures exclude the impacts of charges or credits recorded during the last four years associated with our business realignment initiatives and impairment charges related to goodwill and certain trademarks 
non service related pension expenses are also excluded for each of the last four years  along with acquisition closing and integration costs  primarily associated with the acquisition of brookside in  and a gain on the sale of certain non core trademark licensing rights in non service related pension expenses include interest costs  the expected return on pension plan assets  the amortization of actuarial gains and losses  and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits 
non service related pension expenses may be very volatile from year to year as a result of changes in interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets 
therefore  we have excluded non service related pension expense from our results in accordance with gaap 
we believe that non gaap financial results excluding non service related pension expenses will provide investors with a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our ongoing business 
we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from year to year 
our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants after  resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable

l in may  we entered into an agreement with godrej beverages and foods  ltd  a consumer goods  confectionery and food company  to manufacture and distribute confectionery products  snacks and beverages across india 
under the agreement  we owned a controlling interest in godrej hershey ltd 
in september  we acquired the remaining interest in godrej hershey ltd 
for approximately million 
payments to noncontrolling interests associated with godrej hershey ltd 
were partially offset by equity contributions of million by the noncontrolling interests in hershey do brasil  in addition to the contribution from the noncontrolling interests in hershey do brasil received in l we paid cash dividends of million on our common stock and million on our class b stock in l cash used for the repurchase of common stock was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options and the impact of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation

we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders equity 
l in october  we entered into a new five year agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to billion  with an option to increase borrowings by an additional million with the consent of the lenders 
as of december   billion was available to borrow under the agreement

registration statements l in may  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities 
this registration statement was effective immediately upon filing under securities and exchange commission regulations governing well known seasoned issuers the wksi registration statement 
l in november  we issued million of notes due november  and  in december  we issued million of notes due december  the notes were issued under the wksi registration statement

these may include reducing existing borrowings  financing capital additions  and funding contributions to our pension plans  future business acquisitions and working capital requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows payments due by year in thousands of dollars contractual obligations thereafter total unconditional purchase obligations lease obligations minimum pension plan funding obligations long term debt total obligations in entering into contractual obligations  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution  conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties 
as of december   we did not have any material obligations with european financial institutions 
our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 
purchase obligations we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials 
these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third party brokers and dealers 
these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations 
total obligations for each year presented above consisted of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december  the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods 
we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments to hedge our costs for those periods 
increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments 
this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december  and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts 
taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts 
for each of the three years in the period ended december   we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 
lease obligations lease obligations include the minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for offices  retail stores  warehouse and distribution facilities  and certain equipment 
minimum pension plan funding obligations our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa and federal income tax laws 
effective january   we complied with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of we fund non domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans 
minimum pension plan funding obligations include our current assumptions and estimates of the minimum required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans through for more information  see note  pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
long term debt long term debt primarily includes obligations associated with the issuance of long term debt instruments 
in february  we entered into agreements with ferrero  forming an alliance to mutually benefit from various warehousing  co packing  transportation and procurement services in north america 
the initial terms of the agreements are years  with three renewal periods  each with a term of years 
the agreements include the construction of a warehouse and distribution facility in brantford  ontario  canada for the mutual use of the company and ferrero 
ferrero is responsible for construction of the warehouse and we are responsible for development and implementation of related information systems 
over the term of the agreements  costs associated with the warehouse construction and the information systems will essentially be shared equally 
during  ferrero made payments of approximately million and we made payments of approximately million for construction of the facility 
because we were involved with the design of the facility and made payments during the construction period  the company has been deemed to be the owner of the warehouse and distribution facility for accounting purposes 
as a result  we recorded a total of million in construction in progress as of december   including the payments made by ferrero  the legal owner of the facility 
a corresponding financing obligation of million was recorded as of december   reflecting the amount paid by ferrero 
of the total financing obligation  million was recorded in the current portion of long term debt reflecting our expected payments in and the remainder of million was recorded in long term debt 
asset retirement obligations we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities 
our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations 
current regulations require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished 
costs associated with the removal of asbestos related to the closure of a manufacturing facility under the next century program were recorded in and included in business realignment and impairment charges 
the costs associated with the removal of asbestos from the facility were not material 
with regard to other facilities  we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities 
we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and  therefore  sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 
we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos 
as of december   certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program was being held for sale 
obligations related to the environmental remediation of this real estate have been reflected in our current estimates 
income tax obligations we base our deferred income taxes  accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income  statutory tax rates  the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws 
we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in assessments of additional tax 
we maintain reserves for such assessments 
we adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 
assessments of additional tax require cash payments 
we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments 
the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 
accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments we use certain derivative instruments  from time to time  to manage risks 
these include interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities futures and options contracts to manage commodity market price risk exposures 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures 
these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
we enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments for varying periods 
these commodity derivative instruments are intended to be  and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases  energy requirements and transportation costs 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 
in entering into these contracts  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution  conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties 
we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 
accounting policies associated with derivative instruments we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income 
we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  if any  must be recognized currently in earnings 
fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet 
for fair value hedges  our policy is to record the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item 
the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 
as of december   we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments  including interest rate swap agreements  foreign exchange forward contracts and options  commodities futures and options contracts  and other commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with long term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december  note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 
long term debt the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long term debt  including the current portion  as of december  we determined the fair value of long term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 
maturity date thereafter total fair value in thousands of dollars except for rates long term debt interest rate we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december  interest rate swaps in order to manage interest rate exposure  the company  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements 
in april  the company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated million of term financing expected to be executed during to repay million of notes maturing in april the weighted average fixed rate on these forward starting swap agreements was 
in may  the company entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated million of term financing expected to be executed during to repay million of notes maturing in august the weighted average fixed rate on these forward starting swap agreements was 
the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million as of december  our risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates 
as of december   the potential net loss associated with interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in interest rates of ten percent was approximately million 
in march  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated million of term financing expected to be executed during in september  the forward starting interest rate swap agreements which were entered into in march matured  resulting in cash payments by the company of approximately million 
also in september  we entered into forward starting swap agreements to continue to hedge interest rate exposure related to the term financing 
these swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the notes due november   resulting in cash payments by the company of million 
the losses on the swap agreements are being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the term of the notes 
in december  we terminated forward starting swap agreements which were entered into in august to hedge the anticipated execution of term financing 
the swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the notes due december   resulting in cash receipts of million 
the gain on the swap agreements is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the notes 
for more information see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
foreign exchange forward contracts and options we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment  raw materials and finished goods 
we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the united states 
these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements 
we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from to months 
foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments or forecasted transactions 
we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives 
the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows december  contract amount primary currencies contract amount primary currencies in millions of dollars foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies euros british pound sterling euros british pound sterling foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies canadian dollars canadian dollars the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period 
we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms  adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 
a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows december  in millions of dollars fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts  net asset liability potential net loss associated with foreign exchange forward contracts resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in market rates of ten percent our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
commodities price risk management and futures contracts our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products  sugar  dairy products  peanuts and almonds 
for more information on our major raw material requirements  see raw materials on page the cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts and costs for certain other raw materials historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors 
these factors include l commodity market fluctuations  l currency exchange rates  l imbalances between supply and demand  l the effect of weather on crop yield  l speculative influences  l trade agreements among producing and consuming nations  l political unrest in producing countries  and l changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies 
we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products  sugar  corn sweeteners  natural gas and certain dairy products primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs 
currently  active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing our other major raw material requirements  primarily peanuts and almonds 
we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for to months 
however  the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and  therefore  it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time 
we use diesel swap futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs 
our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs  but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 
during  the average cocoa futures contract prices decreased compared with  and traded in a range between and per pound  based on the intercontinentalexchange futures contract 
after trading at year highs in early  cocoa prices moderated in our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 
during  prices for fluid dairy milk ranged from a low of to a high of per pound  on a class ii fluid milk basis 
higher feed prices resulting from the historic drought in the us caused dairy prices to rise starting in july  but not to the price levels experienced during our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 
in early  sugar supplies in the us were negatively impacted by government import restrictions  however  ideal weather in the north american sugar growing regions caused prices to trade lower in the fall of as a result  refined sugar prices have decreased compared to  trading lower in a range from to per pound 
our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices 
peanut prices in the us began the year around per pound and decreased during the year to per pound 
price decreases were driven by a record crop of million tons  up from almond prices began the year at per pound and increased to per pound during the year driven by a decrease in almond production of approximately versus our costs for peanuts and almonds will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices 
we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the intercontinentalexchange or various other exchanges 
these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses 
we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income 
the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials  energy requirements and transportation costs 
commodity position sensitivity analysis the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of  based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year 
our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities 
inventories  fixed price forward contracts and anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations 
we define a loss  for purposes of determining market risk  as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement 
the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices  including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 
for the years ended december  fair value market risk hypothetical change fair value market risk hypothetical change in millions of dollars highest long position lowest long position average position long decreases or increases in fair values from to primarily reflected changes in net commodity positions 
the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 
use of estimates and other critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in various instances  gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following l accrued liabilities l pension and other post retirement benefits plans l goodwill and other intangible assets l commodities futures and options contracts l income taxes management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note  summary of significant accounting policies 
accrued liabilities accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 
liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition 
information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars promotional costs l we determine the amount of the accrued liability by analysis of programs offered  historical trends  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  sales and payment trends  and experience with payment patterns associated with similar  previously offered programs 
l the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation  particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products 
l reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range a reduction in costs of approximately million  and an increase in costs of approximately million 
l changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes 
l over the three year period ended december   actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than approximately 
l reasonably possible near term changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products l at the time of sale  we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future 
the estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales 
l a related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends  seasonal timing and sales patterns  and product movement at retail 
l estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  changes in consumer demand  the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs 
l over the three year period ended december   costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately of gross sales 
l reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from million to million 
l over the three year period ended december   actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than approximately 
l reasonably possible near term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
pension and other post retirement benefits plans overview we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans 
the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees 
these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january  we also sponsor two primary post retirement benefit plans 
the health care plan is contributory  with participants contributions adjusted annually  and the life insurance plan is non contributory 
we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of and federal income tax laws 
beginning january   we complied with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of we fund non domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans 
we broadly diversify our pension plan assets  consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities 
short term and long term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations 
these calculations consider payroll and employee data  including age and years of service  along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements 
we take into consideration long term projections with regard to economic conditions  including interest rates  return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
with regard to liabilities associated with post retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance  we take into consideration the long term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits 
we review the discount rate assumptions and revise them annually 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption asset return assumption for funded plans is of a longer duration and revised only when long term asset return projections demonstrate that need 
an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans is required to l recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position 
for a pension plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for any other post retirement benefit plan  such as a retiree health care plan  the benefit obligation is the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
l recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
l measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position 
l disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit costs for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations 
pension plans our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows for the years ended december in millions of dollars service cost and amortization of prior service cost interest cost  expected return on plan assets and amortization of net loss administrative expenses net periodic pension benefit cost assumptions average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation asset return assumptions net periodic pension benefit costs we believe that the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost reflect the ongoing operating cost of our pension plans  particularly since our most significant plans were closed to most new entrants after the increase in net periodic pension benefit cost from to was primarily due to the higher amortization of actuarial losses in the current year 
in addition to the increase in net periodic pension benefit cost in  the level of lump sum withdrawals during from two of the company pension plans by employees retiring or leaving the company resulted in a pension settlement loss of million 
our service cost and prior service cost amortization is expected to be approximately million higher in interest cost  expected return on plan assets and amortization of net loss is expected to decrease in by million due primarily to the lower discount rate in  in addition to expected pension settlement costs of million in for more information  see note  pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations 
we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of of a respective plan s projected benefit obligation  or the fair market value of assets  if greater 
the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for is million 
the recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was million 
projections beyond are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 
average discount rate assumption net periodic benefit cost the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations 
in order to estimate this rate for to  a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the towers watson rate link discount curve 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost l a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit expense by million 
l a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit expense by million 
average discount rate assumption benefit obligations the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost as described above 
we reduced our discount rate assumption due to the declining interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations l a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
l a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
asset return assumptions for  we reduced the expected return on plan assets assumption to from the assumption used during  reflecting lower expected future returns on plan assets 
we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit cost on the fair market value of pension plan assets 
to determine the expected return on plan assets  we consider the current asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets 
the historical geometric average return over the years prior to december  was approximately 
the actual return on assets was as follows for the years ended december  actual return on assets the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost l a one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit expense by million 
l a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit expense by million 
our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class 
the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows asset class allocation range equity securities debt securities cash and certain other investments as of december   actual allocations were within the specified ranges 
we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes 
as of december  and  the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the barclays capital us aggregate bond index 
for and  minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material 
however  we made contributions of million in and million in primarily to pay benefits under our non qualified pension plans 
these contributions were fully tax deductible 
a one percentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans 
for  minimum funding requirements of our pension plans are approximately million 
post retirement benefit plans other post retirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net periodic other post retirement benefit cost assumptions average discount rate assumption the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other post retirement benefit cost l a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic other post retirement benefit cost by million 
l a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic other post retirement benefit cost by million 
for the post retirement benefit plans  a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the post retirement benefit obligation 
other post retirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows december  in millions of dollars other post retirement benefit obligation assumptions benefit obligations discount rate assumption l a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
l a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
goodwill and other intangible assets we classify intangible assets into categories intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
our intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of certain trademarks  customer related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions 
we are amortizing trademarks with finite lives over their estimated useful lives of approximately years 
we are amortizing customer related intangible assets over their estimated useful lives of approximately years 
we are amortizing patents over their remaining legal lives of approximately years 
we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets 
our intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of trademarks obtained through business acquisitions 
we do not amortize existing trademarks whose useful lives were determined to be indefinite 
we conduct impairment tests for other intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year  or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 
we evaluate our trademarks with indefinite lives for impairment by comparing their carrying amount to their estimated fair value 
the fair value of trademarks is calculated using a relief from royalty payments methodology 
this approach involves a two step process 
in the first step  we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each trademark 
in the second step  we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
this fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
the estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 
we use a two step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record 
in the second step  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets 
we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 
the assumptions we use to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans 
we also adjust the assumptions  if necessary  to estimates that we believe market participants would use 
such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 
based on our annual impairment evaluations  we determined that no goodwill or other intangible assets were impaired as of december  and december  as a result of operating performance that was below expectations  we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets of godrej hershey ltd 
during the second quarter of as a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows from lower than expected profitability  we determined that the carrying amount of godrej hershey ltd 
exceeded its fair value 
we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of godrej hershey ltd 
to its fair value  including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests 
there was no tax benefit associated with this charge 
commodities futures and options contracts we use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the effect of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs 
additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net after tax losses gains on cash flow hedging derivatives reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income hedge ineffectiveness gains losses recognized in income  before tax l we reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in cost of sales 
l no gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur 
l we recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment 
the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives  including interest rate swap agreements  foreign exchange forward contracts and options  commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments  expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next months was approximately million after tax as of december  this amount was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 
income taxes we base our deferred income taxes  accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income  statutory tax rates  the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws 
we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in assessments of additional tax 
we maintain reserves for such assessments 
we adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 
assessments of additional tax require cash payments 
we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments 
we apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
accordingly  we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement 
we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are recorded for deferred income taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
valuation allowances are primarily associated with tax loss carryforwards from operations in various foreign tax jurisdictions 
future changes in judgment and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position  for which we have unrecognized tax benefits  is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome 
accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense 
we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state  canada and mexico 
during the second quarter of  the irs completed its audit of our us income tax returns for and with no significant adjustments 
tax examinations by various state taxing authorities could be conducted for years beginning in we are no longer subject to canadian federal income tax examinations by the canada revenue agency cra and mexican federal income tax examinations by servicio de administracion tributaria sat for years before during the third quarter of  the cra commenced its audit of our canadian income tax returns for through us  canadian and mexican federal audit issues typically involve the timing of deductions and transfer pricing adjustments 
we work with the irs  the cra and the sat to resolve proposed audit adjustments and to minimize the amount of adjustments 
we do not anticipate that any potential tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million within the next months because of the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlements of tax audits
