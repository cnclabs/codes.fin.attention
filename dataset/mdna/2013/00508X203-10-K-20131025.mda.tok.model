item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background as discussed in item  business  we are a global diversified company that manufactures a broad range of industrial products and systems and are organized into three reportable segments  industrial  energy and engineered solutions 
the industrial segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools to the maintenance  industrial  infrastructure and production automation markets 
the energy segment provides joint integrity products and services  customized offshore vessel mooring solutions  as well as rope and cable solutions to the global oil gas  power generation and energy markets 
the engineered solutions segment provides highly engineered position and motion control systems to oems in various vehicle markets  as well as a variety of other products to the industrial and agricultural markets 
our businesses provide a vast array of products and services across multiple customers and geographies which results in significant diversification 
the long term sales growth and profitability of our segments will depend not only on improved demand in end markets and the overall economic environment  but also on our ability to identify  consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions  develop and market innovative new products  expand our business activity geographically and continuously improve operational excellence 
we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength by adjusting our cost structure to reflect changes in demand levels and by proactively managing working capital and cash flow generation 
our priorities during fiscal include a continued focus on operational excellence  cash flow generation and growth initiatives new product development  market share gains  geographic expansion and strategic acquisitions

table of contents business segment  geographic and customer information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding segment revenues  operating profits and assets 
segment results industrial segment core sales growth in the industrial segment moderated throughout fiscal  as economic conditions globally weakened 
the segment continues to focus on innovative integrated solutions  the commercialization of new products and the expansion of its business in fast growing regions and vertical markets 
despite tepid economic conditions globally we believe the industrial segment will continue to generate low single digit core sales growth over the next twelve months  driven by our vertical market initiatives  new product introductions and the benefit of g i activities 
the following table sets forth summary results of operations for the industrial segment for the three most recent fiscal years in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit operating profit fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal industrial segment net sales increased by million to million 
higher global integrated solutions sales and market share gains contributed to the modest core sales growth in a time of global economic weakness and tough prior year comparables 
operating profit was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a million increase 
operating profit and related margins improved in fiscal due to productivity improvements  slightly higher sales and lower incentive compensation expense  which were somewhat offset by unfavorable product mix 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal industrial segment net sales increased by million to million  the result of solid industrial tool demand across most geographies 
excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes million  year over year core sales growth for fiscal was 
growth innovation initiatives  including targeted vertical market strategies on mining and bolting and integrated solutions market share gains  also contributed to sales growth 
these higher sales volumes  coupled with favorable product mix and lower incentive compensation costs  resulted in operating profit margin expansion during fiscal operating profit in fiscal grew to million  compared to million in fiscal energy segment increased global demand for oil gas and other sources of energy have driven positive end market demand trends for the energy segment 
the energy segment continues to focus on expanding its presence in the global energy markets and successfully integrating the recent viking acquisition 
the energy segment is expected to generate modest core sales growth in fiscal  the result of solid maintenance and umbilical activity  offset by continued soft demand from non energy markets defense  marine and aerospace 
the following table sets forth summary results of operations for the energy segment for the three most recent fiscal years in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit operating profit 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal energy segment net sales for the fiscal year ended august  increased million to million from million in the prior year 
excluding million of sales from acquisitions and the million unfavorable impact of foreign currency rate changes  year over year core sales grew in fiscal due to overall market growth 
energy segment operating profit was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal excluding a million favorable adjustment to an acquisition earn out provision in fiscal  fiscal operating profit improved million  as a result of increased operating leverage driven by higher sales volumes  favorable product mix and lower incentive compensation costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal energy segment net sales for the fiscal year ended august  increased from million to million 
excluding million of sales from the jeyco acquisition in and the impact of foreign currency rate changes which unfavorably impacted sales by million  core sales grew in fiscal the core sales growth reflects market share gains and continued strong demand for our products  rental assets and technical manpower services across the global energy market 
energy segment operating profit increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the year over year improvement in operating profit margins is primarily the result of continued productivity improvements  higher sales volumes and a favorable adjustment to an acquisition earn out provision 
engineered solutions segment despite wide spread weak demand during the first half of fiscal partially due to oem inventory reduction efforts  demand has since improved in the off highway and heavy duty truck markets 
although end market demand is anticipated to be modest  we expect core sales growth in the engineered solutions segment in fiscal  the result of new product launches and the lack of inventory destocking by oems 
the segment continues to focus on the commercialization of new products and execution of restructuring initiatives to reduce cost and improve market competitiveness 
the following table sets forth summary results of operations for the engineered solutions segment for the three most recent fiscal years in millions year ended august  net sales operating profit operating profit fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in the engineered solutions segment decreased million from fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the benefit of million of sales from acquired businesses and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which unfavorably impacted sales by million  core sales declined from the prior year 
the core sales decline was broad based across most served end markets and geographies and primarily reflected challenging economic conditions and oem inventory destocking in the heavy duty truck and off highway markets 
engineered solutions segment operating profit declined to million during fiscal compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to the impact of lower volumes  unfavorable sales mix and million of restructuring costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in the engineered solutions segment increased million to million in fiscal excluding the benefit of million of sales from acquired businesses and the headwind from the weaker euro which unfavorably impacted sales by million  core sales declined from the prior year 
this decline resulted from sharply lower demand and reduced production schedules from vehicle oem s serving the convertible top auto and european and china heavy duty truck markets 
engineered solutions segment operating profit declined modestly to million during fiscal compared to million in the prior year  primarily the result of lower sales and unfavorable product mix 
financing costs  net all debt is considered to be for general corporate purposes and we therefore do not allocate financing costs to our segments 
net financing costs were million  million and million for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the reduction in interest expense in fiscal reflects the conversion of our convertible notes into 
table of contents common stock  as well as the benefit of lower interest rates following the refinancing of our senior notes in the third quarter of fiscal income tax expense our income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are higher or lower than the us federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  tax minimization planning and our ability to utilize various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards to reduce income tax expense 
income tax expense also includes the impact of provision to return adjustments  changes in valuation allowances and reserve requirements for unrecognized tax benefits 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the lower fiscal effective tax rate reflects the benefits of tax minimization planning  the utilization of tax net operating losses  favorable changes in tax laws  increased foreign tax credit utilization and favorable discrete items 
discrete period income tax benefits in fiscal included a million reversal of tax reserves established in prior years as a result of the lapsing of non us income tax statues of limitations and an million adjustment to properly state deferred tax balances related to equity compensation programs see to note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fiscal income tax expense included a million discrete income tax benefit resulting from debt refinancing while fiscal income tax expense included a million benefit from a favorable adjustment to a valuation allowance 
discontinued operations the electrical segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of a broad range of electrical products to the retail diy  wholesale  oem  solar  utility  marine and other harsh environment markets 
our mastervolt business was acquired in december and is comprised of two product lines  solar and marine 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million related to the mastervolt reporting unit 
we recorded a further million impairment charge in fiscal  due to our decision to divest the entire electrical segment 
since its acquisition in fiscal  financial results for mastervolt have been volatile  attributable to challenging business and market conditions and regulatory changes 
substantially all of mastervolt solar sales are in europe 
solar demand has been adversely impacted by weak european economic conditions  government subsidy policy changes and budget challenges and the resulting austerity actions that have impacted solar subsidies  consumer confidence and access to credit 
as a result of financial challenges facing european governments  significant reductions were made to solar feed in tariff fit incentives  which increased the volatility of solar demand  and made investments in solar systems less attractive to potential buyers 
reduced fit unfavorably impact our customers return on investment in solar systems  thereby creating downward pressure on solar inverter pricing 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  reduced incentive schemes were announced and implemented in mastervolt key served markets united kingdom  france  belgium  germany and italy 
the combination of all of these factors reduced mastervolt solar sales and margins 
this necessitated several actions  including negotiating lower product cost from mastervolt suppliers  increasing our efforts to reduce solar inventory levels  initiating management changes  narrowing the focus of the solar business to certain key markets and product lines and reducing overhead through facility closures and headcount reductions 
mastervolt generated million in sales and million in operating profit in fiscal  excluding the million fourth quarter non cash impairment charge 
despite the year over year improvement in operating results in the second half of fiscal relative to operating losses in the prior year comparable periods the business continued to underperform relative to expectations in its solar product line 
while we believe the solar industry will continue to grow  we reduced mastervolt long term sales and profitability expectations as a result of continued pricing pressure  the frequent imbalance between solar industry inverter supply and demand resulting in excess inventory and the volatile nature of end market demand given frequent unfavorable fit changes 
we also reviewed the long term strategic fit of the mastervolt business in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as part of our annual strategic plan and portfolio management process 
various actions to address the mastervolt business  and the solar product line in particular  were considered  including continuing to operate and invest in the business  implementing significant restructuring and downsizing actions or exiting the entire business or the solar product line through a possible closure or sale 
the adverse business  economic and competitive factors  coupled with the uncertainty regarding the long term strategic fit of the business  resulted in a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal this consisted of the write down of million of goodwill and million of indefinite lived intangible assets tradename 
the remaining carrying value of the mastervolt business was million at august  including million of net tangible assets and million of intangible assets  goodwill and deferred income taxes 

table of contents during the first half of fiscal  we initiated additional restructuring actions including headcount reductions and facility closures in the electrical segment to respond to weak overall demand and negative year over year core sales growth for the segment 
following additional portfolio management discussions  we committed to a plan to divest the entire electrical segment in may we have engaged an investment bank to assist us in the sale process and believe that a sale will be completed in the first half of fiscal  subject to terms that are usual and customary for the sale of a business 
the divestiture will allow us to streamline our business portfolio and refocus on the remaining three segments in a way that better positions the company to take advantage of our core competencies  current business model and global growth trends 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge in fiscal of million  including a write down of million of goodwill and million of tradenames 
following this write down  there is no remaining goodwill associated with the mastervolt reporting unit and million of remaining north american electrical goodwill 
refer to note  discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the carrying value of assets held for sale 
the results of operations for the electrical segment have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations in millions for the last three fiscal years year ended august  net sales operating profit impairment charges net loss on disposal income tax benefit expense income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes in fiscal the company completed the sale of its european electrical business for cash proceeds of million 
as a result of the sale transaction  the company recognized a pre tax loss on disposal of million  including an million charge to cover future lease payments on an unfavorable real estate lease used by the divested business 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the cash flow attributable to operating  investing and financing activities in millions year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities during fiscal were million  primarily consisting of net earnings and effective working capital management  offset by the payment of million of fiscal incentive compensation costs 
investing activities during fiscal included million of net capital expenditures and the receipt of million in proceeds related to the divestiture of the nielsen sessions business 
existing cash  borrowings under the revolving credit facility and operating cash flows funded the million purchase price of the viking acquisition  the repurchase of approximately million shares of the company s common stock million and the annual dividend 
cash flows from operating activities in fiscal were million  the result of strong cash earnings and effective working capital management  which were partially offset by the use of million in the debt refinancing 
this net operating cash flow and the proceeds from the debt refinancing funded million of share repurchases  million of business acquisitions and the repayment of revolving credit facility borrowings 
proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment which included the sale leaseback of certain equipment and the sale of a vacant facility were million  while capital expenditures totaled million 

table of contents during fiscal we generated million of cash flow from operations  a combination of strong earnings from continuing operations and the ongoing focus on working capital management 
we utilized this cash flow  as well as borrowings under our senior credit facility and the million of proceeds from the sale of the european electrical business to fund the mastervolt and weasler acquisitions totaling million and million of capital expenditures 
primary working capital management we use primary working capital pwc as a percentage of sales as a key indicator of working capital management 
we define this metric as the sum of net accounts receivable and net inventory less accounts payable  divided by the past three months sales annualized 
we view this as a measure of asset management efficiency 
the following table shows the components of the metric amounts in millions august  august  pwc pwc accounts receivable  net inventory  net accounts payable net primary working capital liquidity our senior credit facility  which matures on july   includes a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan and a million expansion option 
quarterly principal payments of million begin on the term loan on september   increasing to million per quarter beginning on september   with the remaining principal due at maturity 
at august   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of unused capacity on the revolver all of which was available to borrow 
we believe that the availability under the senior credit facility  combined with our existing cash on hand and anticipated operating cash flows will be adequate to meet operating  debt service  stock buyback  acquisition funding and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
see note  debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the senior credit facility 
seasonality and working capital we have met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and revolver availability under our senior credit facility 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
we have no single customer which generated or more of fiscal net sales 
capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing activities consist of the assembly of components which are sourced from a variety of vendors 
as a result  we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
capital expenditures which have historically been funded by operating cash flows were million in fiscal and million in both fiscal and capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be in the range of to million  but could vary from that depending on business and growth opportunities 
commitments and contingencies given our desire to allocate available cash flow and revolver availability to fund growth initiatives  we typically lease much of our operating equipment and facilities 
we lease certain facilities  computers  equipment and vehicles under various operating lease agreements  generally over periods ranging from one to twenty years 
under most arrangements  we pay the property taxes  insurance  maintenance and expenses related to the leased property 
many of the leases include provisions that enable us to renew the lease based upon fair value rental rates on the date of expiration of the initial lease 
see note  leases  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the contractual obligations table below for further information 
we are contingently liable for certain lease payments under leases of businesses that we previously divested or spun off 
some of these businesses were subsequently sold to third parties 
if any of these businesses do not fulfill their future lease 
table of contents payment obligations under the leases  we could be liable for such leases 
the present value of future minimum lease payments for these leases was million at august  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and million at august  and  respectively  the majority of which secure self insured workers compensation liabilities 
contractual obligations the timing of payments due under our contractual commitments is as follows in millions payments due thereafter total long term debt principal interest on long term debt operating leases deferred acquisition purchase price our operating lease obligations generally relate to amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for real estate leases  information technology services including software and hardware support services and leases and telecommunications services 
only those obligations that are not cancelable are included in the table 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are generally cancelable with reasonable notice to the vendor  and are therefore excluded from this table 
we have long term obligations related to our deferred compensation  pension and postretirement plans that are excluded from this table  summarized in note  employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have unrecognized tax benefits of million at august  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was not included in the table of contractual obligations because the timing of the potential settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
for product sales  delivery does not occur until the passage of title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer generally when products are shipped 
revenue from services are recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term 
we record allowances for discounts  product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends 
we also offer warranty on our products and accrue for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period  historical warranty cost trends and any other related information 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for a portion of us owned inventory approximately and of total inventories at august  and  respectively 
the first in  first out or average cost method is used for all other inventories 
if the lifo method were not used  the inventory balance would be higher than the amount in the consolidated balance sheet by approximately million at august  and million at august  we perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value 
the inventory valuation assumptions used are based on historical experience 
we believe that such estimates are made based on consistent and appropriate methods  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents goodwill and long lived assets annual impairment review  estimates and sensitivity our business acquisition purchase price allocation typically results in recording goodwill and other intangible assets  which are a significant portion of our total assets 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if triggering events occur  we compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss  if any  is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the estimated fair value represents the amount we think a reporting unit could be bought or sold for in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
in estimating the fair value  we generally use a discounted cash flow model  which is dependent on a number of assumptions including estimated future revenues and expenses  weighted average cost of capital  capital expenditures and other variables 
the expected future revenue growth rates and operating profit margins are determined after taking into consideration our historical revenue growth rates and earnings levels  our assessment of future market potential and our expectations of future business performance 
under the discounted cash flow approach  the fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows over a discrete seven year period plus an estimated terminal value 
in certain circumstances we also review a market approach in which a trading multiple is applied to a forecasted ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization of the reporting unit to arrive at the estimated fair value 
our fourth quarter fiscal impairment calculations included one reporting unit mastervolt in which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value see discussion below on fiscal impairment charge and one reporting unit north american electrical that had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by 
the carrying value of the north american electrical reporting unit was million at august   including million of goodwill from previously completed acquisitions 
key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the north american electrical reporting unit included single digit sales growth including in the terminal year and a discount rate 
the estimated future cash flows assumed improved profitability relative to actual fiscal results driven by savings and efficiencies from the consolidation of manufacturing facilities which was completed in late fiscal 
the assumptions that have the most significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit are market valuation multiples  the discount rate and sales growth rates 
a basis point increase in the discount rate results in a decrease to the estimated fair value by approximately  while a reduction in the terminal year sales growth rate assumption by basis points would decrease the estimated fair value by approximately 
for the remaining seven reporting units  our annual goodwill impairment testing in fiscal indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value expressed as a percentage of the carrying value in excess of 
at august   the fair value of each of our six reporting units from continuing operations exceeded the carrying value in excess of 
key assumptions utilized to estimate the fair value of the reporting units under a discounted cash flow model included discount rates ranging from to  modest revenue growth rates including in the terminal year and a slight improvement in margins as a result of increased operating leverage 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets 
while we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 
significant negative industry or economic trends  disruptions to the company business  loss of significant customers  inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses  unexpected significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets or in entity structure and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations and ultimately result in future impairment charges 
fiscal impairment charge as a result of the uncertainty regarding the long term strategic fit of the mastervolt business a triggering event in the fourth quarter  the fiscal mastervolt goodwill impairment test utilized both market and income valuation approaches under various scenarios  which were weighted based on the probability of future outcomes  as a single discounted cash flow model with a holding period into perpetuity was no longer appropriate 
key assumptions included market multiples  a higher discount rate relative to our remaining reporting units and the expectation of continued positive cash flows in future years 
financial projections also assumed moderate sales growth in the marine market and a projected rebound in solar sales levels in fiscal  with single digit annual sales growth in future years 
the prior mastervolt valuation was determined solely based on an income valuation approach and utilized a consistent discount rate  terminal year growth rate and expected long term profit margin assumption 
however  sales and cash flow projections during the discrete projection period in the fiscal impairment calculation were reduced by approximately relative to prior assumptions 
the assumptions that have the most significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit are market valuation multiples  the discount rate and sales growth rates 
a basis point increase in the discount rate results in a decrease to the estimated fair value by approximately  while a reduction in the terminal year sales growth rate assumption by basis points would decrease the estimated fair value by approximately 
while we use the best available information 
table of contents to prepare the cash flow assumptions  actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ  resulting in future impairment charges related to goodwill 
fiscal interim impairment charge the material changes in assumptions from the fourth quarter fiscal impairment tests to third quarter fiscal mastervolt and north american electrical impairment tests were principally a reduction in market valuation multiples as updated information regarding potential buyers  m a market conditions and multiples of comparable transactions supported a lower valuation and lower projected sales volumes  which adversely impacted margin and cash flow assumptions 
uncertainty regarding the long term growth prospects of the solar market  given its volatile nature and recent industry consolidations exits by suppliers  also negatively impacted market multiple assumptions consistent with declining valuations of public solar companies 
our decision to divest the electrical segment in may also impacted the impairment calculations  shortening the holding period of the businesses and placing more weighting on the market approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
while the mastervolt marine product line generated sales growth in fiscal  the continued volatility in the solar market  reduced government solar incentives to buyers  increased competitive pricing pressure due to excess inventory throughout the solar industry  coupled with delays in new product launches  business interruption caused by a fire in our research and development lab and the narrowing of our solar product focus collectively resulted in significantly reduced sales projections for the mastervolt business unit 
similar to other solar industry suppliers  we no longer expect a significant near term rebound in solar sales that was previously anticipated and therefore revised our financial projections to include lower solar sales levels and reduced profit levels in the future 
the revised financial projections and an increase in the discount rate from to given the associated risk premium and market outlook resulted in a million goodwill impairment 
while we believe that our north american electrical business diverse electrical products and technologies will continue to generate positive cash flows and earnings  the decision to divest the electrical segment represented a triggering event requiring an interim impairment review 
the third quarter fiscal goodwill impairment charge of million reflected current market conditions lower projected market multiples  a discount rate compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal and a consistent expectation regarding moderate to long term sales growth  including a terminal year growth rate 
sales projections for the north american electrical business incorporated developments during the first nine months of fiscal  in which sales were below prior year levels by approximately 
this decline resulted from the loss of certain low margin retail diy business  channel inventory reductions across served markets and reduced transformer product line demand from major oem customers 
despite the reduced sales volumes  profit margins remained consistent with prior projections the result of controlled spending and the benefits of current year headcount reductions 
to the extent actual proceeds on the ultimate electrical segment divestiture are less than current projections  or there are changes in the composition of the asset disposal group  further write downs of the carrying value of the electrical segment may be required 
long lived assets indefinite lived intangible assets are also subject to annual impairment testing 
on an annual basis  the fair value of the indefinite lived assets  based on a relief of royalty income approach  are evaluated to determine if an impairment charge is required 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized a million impairment of the mastervolt tradename the result of a reduction in the assumed royal rate from to and lower projected long term mastervolt solar sales 
in the third quarter of fiscal we also reassessed the recoverability of all electrical segment tradenames as a result of the plan to divest the segment  and recognized an additional million tradename impairment 
the estimated fair value of the tradenames were adversely impacted by further reductions in royalty rate assumptions  an increase in the discount rate and lower projected sales volumes 
we also review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such indicators are present  we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized an million impairment of electrical segment long lived assets  representing the excess of the net book value of the assets held for sale over the estimated fair value  less selling costs 
we re assessed our initial estimate of fair value less selling costs based on additional information available as a result of the sale process as of august  and recognized an million increase to the carrying value of the electrical segment assets 
business combinations and purchase accounting we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting  and accordingly  the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill 
assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values  and the values of assets in use  and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions 
while the ultimate responsibility resides with management  for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including intangible assets and tangible long lived assets 
acquired intangible assets  excluding goodwill  are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology based 
table of contents on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased 
this methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions  the most significant being projected revenue growth rates  earnings margins  and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate 
employee benefit plans we provide a variety of benefits to employees and former employees  including in some cases  pensions and postretirement health care 
plan assets and obligations are recorded based on a august measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return and health care cost trend rates 
we determine the discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of our benefit obligations  with appropriate consideration of local market factors  participant demographics and benefit payment forecasts 
at august  and  the weighted average discount rate on domestic benefit plans was and  respectively 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider the historical returns on plan assets  forward looking considerations  inflation assumptions and the impact of the management of the plans invested assets 
domestic benefit plan assets consist primarily of participating units in mutual funds  index funds and bond funds 
the expected return on domestic benefit plan assets was and at august  and  respectively 
a basis point change in the assumptions for the discount rate or expected return on plan assets would not materially change fiscal domestic benefit plan expense 
we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of any modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by independent actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note  employee benefit plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense also reflects our best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income and the effect of various tax planning strategies 
however  future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded use of estimates we record reserves or allowances for customer rebates  returns and discounts  doubtful accounts  inventory  incurred but not reported medical claims  environmental matters  warranty claims  workers compensation claims  product and non product litigation and incentive compensation 
these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that such estimates are made on a consistent basis and with appropriate assumptions and methods 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included within note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk we maintain operations in the us and various foreign countries 
our non us operations  the largest of which are located in the netherlands  united kingdom  mexico and china  have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers  payments to suppliers and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
under certain conditions  we enter into hedging transactions  primarily forward foreign currency swaps  that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rate risk see note  derivatives in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions  as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
the strengthening of the us dollar could also result in unfavorable translation effects on our results of operations and financial position as the results of foreign operations are translated into us dollars 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the translation of our results of operations  annual sales and operating profit were remeasured assuming a ten percent reduction in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
under this assumption  annual sales and operating profit would have been million and million lower  respectively  for the twelve months ended august  this sensitivity analysis assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction 
table of contents relative to the us dollar and excludes the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have on actual sales or price levels 
similarly  a ten percent decline in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our august  financial position would result in a million reduction to equity accumulated other comprehensive loss  as a result of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities being translated into us dollars  our reporting currency 
interest rate risk we have earnings exposure related to interest rate changes on our outstanding floating rate debt that is indexed off of libor interest rates 
we periodically utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage overall financing costs and interest rate risk 
as discussed in note  debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  at august  we were a party to interest rate swap agreements that converted million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate of interest 
these swaps were terminated during fiscal as part of the debt refinancing transaction 
a basis point increase or decrease in the applicable interest rates on our variable rate debt as of august  would result in a corresponding change in financing costs of approximately million on an annual basis 
commodity risk we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials  such as steel  plastic resin and copper  are subject to price fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our results 
we strive to pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion and utilize lead initiatives to further mitigate the impact of commodity raw material price fluctuations as improved efficiencies across all locations are achieved
