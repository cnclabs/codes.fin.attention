we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason 
overview we design  manufacture  and sell internet protocol ip based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology it industry and provide services associated with these products and their use 
we provide a broad line of products for transporting data  voice  and video within buildings  across campuses  and around the world 
our products are designed to transform how people connect  communicate  and collaborate 
our products are utilized at enterprise businesses  public institutions  telecommunications companies and other service providers  commercial businesses  and personal residences

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal financial performance revenue increased  with product revenue increasing and service revenue increasing 
total gross margin decreased by percentage points 
various items such as higher amortization of purchased intangible assets and the tivo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal contributed to the product gross margin percentage decline 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by percentage points  primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenses and lower general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were lower due primarily to the absence in the current fiscal year of impairment charges on real estate held for sale 
operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points  primarily as a result of an increase in revenue  lower restructuring charges  and our continuing focus on expense management 
diluted earnings per share increased by from the prior year  a result of both a increase in net income and also  to a lesser degree  from a slight decline of million shares in our diluted share count 
a significant driver of the increase in net income in fiscal was our realization of additional tax benefits of billion  primarily related to a tax settlement with the irs and the reinstatement of the us federal r d tax credit 
fiscal compared with fiscal business summary our solid fiscal performance reflects our continued execution on our financial strategy to deliver profitable growth to maximize shareholder value for the long term 
in what continues to be a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment  we grew profits faster than revenue  with revenue increasing by  while net income increased by 
in fiscal  revenue increased by billion 
the americas contributed billion of the increase  led by higher sales in the united states 
apjc contributed billion to the revenue increase  led by strong sales growth in india 
emea added billion to the revenue increase in fiscal both our product and service categories experienced revenue growth across each of our geographic segments 
we encountered certain challenges from a geographic perspective  including those related to macroeconomic challenges in much of europe 
we also faced some macroeconomic challenges in apjc  particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which most notably involved china and japan 
partially offsetting these challenges was solid revenue growth in fiscal in certain emerging countries such as mexico within the americas  india within apjc  and russia within emea 
from a customer markets standpoint  in fiscal we had solid revenue growth in the commercial market  as well as growth in the service provider market  due in large part to the acquisition of nds 
the enterprise and public sector customer markets experienced slight declines in revenue in fiscal as compared with fiscal global public sector spending was a challenge for us in fiscal  particularly in the americas  attributable in part to lower us public sector spending during parts of fiscal as compared with fiscal in fiscal  product revenue increased by billion  while service revenue increased by billion 
the product revenue increase was driven by the following an increase of billion from service provider video products  driven primarily by the acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal  an increase of billion from data center products  due to continued strong customer demand  and an increase of billion from wireless products  due to continued demand for these solutions 
these product revenue increases  along with the service revenue contribution  reflect  in our view  the success we are experiencing with our technology architectures and our ability to deliver customer solutions  particularly in both the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments 
overall  our product revenue from our core product areas was flat as an increase in revenue from our switching products was offset by a decrease in revenue from our ngn routing products 
we achieved solid and profitable growth in fiscal  and did so in a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment 
this included  in particular  weakness in the european economy  lower global public sector spending  and a conservative approach to it related capital spending by customers 
notwithstanding improvements we saw in some of these areas during the latter part of fiscal  our business in fiscal may continue to be impacted by these challenges  as well as other macroeconomic challenges including weakness in certain emerging countries  such as china 
in order to invest more significantly in our growth opportunity areas of our portfolio including cloud  data center  mobility  services  software and security  we will rebalance our resources in fiscal as a result  we have announced a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately  employees or of our global workforce 
we expect that these actions will position cisco to invest in these growth opportunities as our business continues to evolve and to drive operational efficiencies 

table of contents fourth quarter snapshot for the fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal  revenue increased by  with both product and service revenue increasing by 
with regard to our geographic segment performance  on a year over year basis  revenue increased by in the americas  increased by in emea  and decreased by in apjc 
total gross margin decreased by percentage points  primarily as a result of the tivo patent litigation settlement 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by percentage points  primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal  general and administrative expenses included million of real estate charges  primarily related to impairment charges on real estate held for sale 
operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points  primarily as a result of lower general and administrative expenses  lower restructuring and other charges  and also the impact of our revenue increase 
diluted earnings per share increased by from the prior year period  primarily as a result of an increase in net income 
strategy and focus areas our focus continues to be on our five foundational priorities leadership in our core business routing  switching  and associated services which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions collaboration data center virtualization and cloud video architectures for business transformation we believe that focusing on these priorities best positions us to continue to expand our share of our customers information technology spending

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
contracts  internet commerce agreements  and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility is reasonably assured 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
when a sale involves multiple deliverables  such as sales of products that include services  the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting  and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price 
revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and  if so  our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables 
according to the accounting guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition  we use vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those units  when available 
we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by approximately of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus of the median rates 
when vsoe does not exist  we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple deliverable arrangements 
under the selling price hierarchy  third party evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist  and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
generally  we are not able to determine tpe because our go to market strategy differs from that of others in our markets  and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers 
in determining esp  we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors  based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company specific factors such as geographies  competitive landscape  internal costs  profitability objectives  pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing  and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 
some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components 
such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in asc  software revenue recognition 
as our business and offerings evolve over time  our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly  which could result in changes in selling prices  including both vsoe and esp  in subsequent periods 
there were no material impacts during fiscal  nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe  tpe  or esp 
revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements  service  support  and other factors 
financing arrangements may include sales type  direct financing  and operating leases  loans  and guarantees of third party financing 
our deferred revenue for products was billion and billion as of july  and july   respectively 
technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed  which typically is from one to three years 
advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
our deferred revenue for services was billion and billion as of july  and july   respectively 

table of contents we make sales to distributors which we refer to as two tier systems of sales to the end customer 
revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sell through method using information provided by them 
our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs  and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs 
if actual credits received by our distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates  which are based on historical experience  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowances for receivables and sales returns the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions  except percentages july  july  allowance for doubtful accounts percentage of gross accounts receivable allowance for credit loss lease receivables percentage of gross lease receivables allowance for credit loss loan receivables percentage of gross loan receivables the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience  credit quality and age of the receivable balances  as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates  which are published by major third party credit rating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis 
we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts 
if a major customer creditworthiness deteriorates  if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts 
we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis 
when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis  we consider historical experience  credit quality and age of receivable balances  and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis  we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third party credit rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default  while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions  concentration of risk and correlation 
determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings  as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions  concentration of risk  and correlation  are complex and subjective 
our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future  which could adversely affect our operating results 
both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 
a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates 
the reserve for future sales returns as of july  and july  was million and million  respectively  and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers our inventory balance was billion and billion as of july  and july   respectively 
inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories  determined primarily by future demand forecasts 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market  based upon assumptions about future demand  and are charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of our cost of sales 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
we record a liability for firm  noncancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory 
as of july   the liability for these purchase commitments was million  compared with million as of july   and was included in other current liabilities 

table of contents our provision for inventory was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in our provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for fiscal was primarily due to the increase in demand for our products resulting in lower inventory levels with our contract manufacturers during fiscal if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory write downs  and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers  and accordingly our profitability  could be adversely affected 
we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments 
inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence  particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast 
warranty costs the liability for product warranties  included in other current liabilities  was million as of july   compared with million as of july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from days to five years  and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and associated overhead 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 
the provision for product warranties issued during fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected  our profitability could be adversely affected 
share based compensation expense share based compensation expense is presented as follows in millions years ended july  july  july  share based compensation expense restricted stock units are valued using the market value of our common stock on the date of grant  discounted for the present value of expected dividends 
restricted stock unit awards with market based conditions are valued using a monte carlo simulation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
for employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights  these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the risk free interest rate  and expected dividends as of the grant date 
for employee stock options  we historically have used the implied volatility for two year traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the lattice binomial model 
for employee stock purchase rights  we used the implied volatility for traded options with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights on our stock 
the selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the valuation of employee stock options granted in prior fiscal years  but for which expense was recognized during the fiscal years presented is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness  which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for forfeitures 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates  the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year 

table of contents fair value measurements our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities  collectively  are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of billion as of july   compared with billion as of july  our fixed income investment portfolio  as of july   consisted primarily of high quality investment grade securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent  objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments 
it encompasses three classes of investments level consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities  level consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level inputs are used  such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model derived valuations for which the variables are derived from  or corroborated by  observable market data  and level consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 
our level securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data 
we use inputs such as actual trade data  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  and other similar data  which are obtained from independent pricing vendors  quoted market prices  or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities 
we use such pricing data as the primary input  to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal and  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio 
we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 
the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness  may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information  and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value 
the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective 
however  given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio  and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets  we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july  we had no level investments in our total portfolio as of july  other than temporary impairments we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
the ultimate value realized on these securities  to the extent unhedged  is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost  we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary 
an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security  ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis  or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security 
if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence  the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings 
if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii  the amount representing credit loss  defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security  will be recognized in earnings  and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci 
in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected  we consider all available information  including past events  current conditions  the remaining payment terms of the security  the financial condition of the issuer  expected defaults  and the value of underlying collateral 
for publicly traded equity securities  we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were not material in fiscal   and there were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal   and our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future  which could adversely affect our net income 
we also have investments in privately held companies  some of which are in the startup or development stages 
as of july   our investments in privately held companies were million  compared with million as of july   and were included in other assets 
we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required  based primarily on the financial condition and near term prospects of these companies 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 

table of contents goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques 
goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date  which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired  including contingent consideration 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit 
the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 
the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july  and july  was billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in goodwill for fiscal was due in large part to our acquisitions of nds and meraki 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
there was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal   and for the annual impairment testing in fiscal  the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was billion for the americas  billion for emea  and billion for apjc 
we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of july  would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
there was no impairment charge related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future  which could adversely affect our net income 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate  primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes  foreign operations  r d tax credits  domestic manufacturing deductions  tax audit settlements  nondeductible compensation  international realignments  and transfer pricing adjustments 
our effective tax rate was   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  by expiration of or lapses in the r d tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws  by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives  by transfer pricing adjustments  including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r d cost sharing arrangement and legal structure  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation  by tax costs related to intercompany realignments  by changes in accounting principles  or by changes in tax laws and regulations  including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income  or the foreign tax credit rules 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions  including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital 
further  as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments  our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax 
our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
third parties  including customers  have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent  copyright  trademark  and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us 
these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions  particularly in the united states 
if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful  or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents results of operations revenue the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions  except percentages years ended july  july  variance in dollars variance in percent july  july  variance in dollars variance in percent revenue product percentage of revenue service percentage of revenue total we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis  organized into three geographic segments 
our revenue  which includes product and service  for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions  except percentages years ended july  july  variance in dollars variance in percent july  july  variance in dollars variance in percent revenue americas percentage of revenue emea percentage of revenue apjc percentage of revenue total fiscal compared with fiscal for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  total revenue increased by 
within total revenue growth  product revenue increased by  while service revenue increased by 
our product and service revenue totals reflect revenue growth across each of our geographic segments 
the revenue increase was primarily due to the following the solid performance of our service offerings  our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal  and increased demand for our data center and wireless products 
we conduct business globally in numerous currencies 
the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies  such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non us customers and thereby reduces demand 
a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect 
however  the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 
in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors  including a reduced it spending environment and budget driven reductions in spending by government entities  revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition  including the complexity of transactions such as multiple element arrangements  the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers  and final acceptance of the product  system  or solution  among other factors 
in addition  certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases  and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition  which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment 
as has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time  customers require greater levels of financing arrangements  service  and support  and these activities may occur in future periods  which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue

table of contents gross margin the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions  except percentages amount percentage years ended july  july  july  july  july  july  gross margin product service total product gross margin fiscal compared with fiscal the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal to fiscal product gross margin percentage fiscal sales discounts  rebates  and product pricing mix of products sold productivity tivo patent litigation settlement amortization of purchased intangible assets acquisition fair value adjustment to inventory and other fiscal productivity includes overall manufacturing related costs  shipment volume  and other items not categorized elsewhere 
product gross margin decreased by percentage points compared with fiscal higher sales discounts  rebates  and unfavorable product pricing contributed to our decreased product gross margin percentage in fiscal these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments 
additionally  our product gross margin for fiscal was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold  primarily as a result of revenue increases for our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products 
these impacts were offset by continued productivity improvements 
the productivity improvements were in large part due to increased benefits from cost savings  particularly in certain of our switching and ngn routing categories in which product transitions have been taking place  and were driven by value engineering efforts  favorable component pricing  and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations 
value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign  board configuration  test processes  and transformation processes 
because the preceding factors largely offset each other  the decline in our product gross margin percentage was largely driven by our acquisition of nds  which resulted in higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets along with costs resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired as part of that acquisition 
in addition  during fiscal we incurred charges related to the tivo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter that were included as part of cost of sales 
the combined effect of these items was a negative impact to our product gross margin of percentage points for fiscal our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and could be adversely affected by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins  such as cisco unified computing system products 
our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue and  as was the case in fiscal and  may be adversely affected by increased sales discounts  rebates  and product pricing attributable to competitive factors 
additionally  our manufacturing related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain  which in turn could negatively affect gross margin 
if any of the preceding factors that in the past have negatively impacted our gross margins arise in future periods  our gross margins could continue to decline 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal to fiscal product gross margin percentage fiscal sales discounts  rebates  and product pricing mix of products sold productivity amortization of purchased intangible assets restructuring and other charges fiscal beginning in fiscal  we refined our methodology for presenting the items in the preceding table  and accordingly certain reclassifications have been made to fiscal amounts to conform to the presentation made for the fiscal amounts 
in fiscal  product gross margin decreased by percentage points compared with fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts  rebates  and unfavorable product pricing  which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue 
these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments 
additionally  our product gross margin for fiscal was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold  primarily as a result of revenue increases in our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products and increased revenue in other lower margin products 
in fiscal  we experienced a positive mix impact from the absence of the lower margin consumer related products due to our exit from the flip video camera product line in fiscal the negative impacts to product gross margin were partially offset by lower restructuring charges  the absence of significant impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets  lower amortization expense in fiscal and productivity improvements 
the productivity improvements were in part due to increased benefits from our value engineering efforts  particularly in certain of our switching products  favorable component pricing  and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations 
service gross margin fiscal compared with fiscal our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by percentage points for fiscal  as compared with fiscal although we experienced higher sales volume from growth in both advanced services and in technical support services  the resulting benefit to gross margin was offset by increased cost impacts such as headcount related costs  partner delivery costs  and unfavorable mix 
the mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services business contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal  as compared with fiscal our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals  our strategic investments in headcount  and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business 
other factors include the mix of service offerings  as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 
fiscal compared with fiscal our service gross margin percentage increased by percentage points for fiscal  as compared with fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume for both technical support services and advanced services 
the benefit to gross margin of increased volume was partially offset by increased headcount related and partner delivery costs  and unfavorable mix 
the mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services revenue contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal  as compared with the prior year 
lower share based compensation expense in fiscal as compared with fiscal also added to the increase in service gross margin 
for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  gross margin from technical support services was flat as the benefits from a increase in revenue combined with lower supply chain costs were offset by higher headcount related costs 
for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  gross margin in advanced services increased primarily due to a increase in revenue in fiscal partially offsetting the volume benefit were higher delivery team costs which were  in part headcount related  and higher partner delivery costs 
our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers networking devices  applications  and infrastructures

we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 
fiscal compared with fiscal we experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our americas and apjc segments  while our emea segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase 
the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline due to the impact of higher sales discounts  rebates and unfavorable pricing  and also due to unfavorable mix impacts  partially offset by productivity improvements 
the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was primarily the result of productivity improvements from lower overall manufacturing costs and  to a lesser degree  favorable mix impacts and higher service gross margin 
partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from higher sales discounts  rebates and unfavorable pricing 
the apjc segment gross margin percentage declined due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts  rebates and unfavorable pricing  lower service gross margin  and unfavorable mix impacts 
partially offsetting these factors were productivity improvements  driven in large part by lower overall manufacturing costs and higher volume 
the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate  and period to period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment 
our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities  and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods 
fiscal compared with fiscal for fiscal  we experienced a gross margin percentage decline across all of our geographic segments as compared with fiscal the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline with the impact of higher sales discounts  rebates and unfavorable pricing being substantially offset by higher volume  higher service gross margin  lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs  and favorable mix impacts 
significantly lower revenue from the consumer market resulted in a positive gross margin mix impact to the americas segment for fiscal the gross margin percentage decline in our emea segment was primarily the result of unfavorable mix impacts  higher sales discounts  rebates and unfavorable pricing  and lower service gross margin due to increased headcount related costs 
these decreases were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs and increased volume in this segment 
the apjc segment experienced the largest gross margin percentage decline of all of our geographic segments due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts  rebates and unfavorable pricing  lower service gross margin  and unfavorable mix impacts 
these decreases were partially offset by increased volume and lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs 

table of contents factors that may impact revenue and gross margin product revenue may continue to be affected by factors  including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty  that have resulted in cautious it related capital spending in our enterprise  service provider  public sector  and commercial markets  changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions  competition  including price focused competitors from asia  especially from china  new product introductions  sales cycles and product implementation cycles  changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets  changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales  variations in sales channels  and final acceptance criteria of the product  system  or solution as specified by the customer 
sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases  especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our collaboration and data center product categories 
in addition  service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles  require a broader range of services  including network design services  and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition 
certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases  and the revenue related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition 
as we focus on new market opportunities  customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements  service  and support  especially in certain emerging countries  which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition 
to improve customer satisfaction  we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead time performance  which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog 
a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter to quarter revenue and operating results 
product revenue may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products  especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and internet businesses  whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market  price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry  introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products  adoption of new networking standards  and financial difficulties experienced by our customers 
we may  from time to time  experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers ability to provide specific components  resulting in delayed shipments 
to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future  and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity  it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter 
for additional factors that may impact product revenue  see part i  item a 
risk factors 
our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs 
increased sales to our distributors generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and  to a certain degree  the timing of orders from our customers 
we recognize revenue for sales to our distributors generally based on a sell through method using information provided by them  and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 
product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold  including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products  introduction of new products  including products with price performance advantages  and new business models for our offerings such as xaas  our ability to reduce production costs  entry into new markets  including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures  as a result of internal development or through acquisitions  changes in distribution channels  price competition  including competitors from asia  especially those from china  changes in geographic mix of our product revenue  the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals  sales discounts  increases in material or labor costs  including share based compensation expense  excess inventory and obsolescence charges  warranty costs  changes in shipment volume  loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing  effects of value engineering  inventory holding charges  and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans 
additionally  our manufacturing related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain 
service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services  the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals  share based compensation expense  and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business

fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease in r d expenses for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  was primarily due to lower headcount related expenses resulting from our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and lower share based compensation expense 
additionally  r d expenses declined due to lower acquisition related expenses  which were driven by the absence in fiscal of certain compensation payments that were paid in the prior year 
sales and marketing expenses fiscal compared with fiscal for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  primarily due to lower share based compensation expense and  to a lesser degree  lower discretionary spending and contracted services

fiscal compared with fiscal for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased by million 
marketing expenses decreased by million  which were partially offset by an increase of million in sales expenses 
the decrease in marketing expenses for the period was due to lower advertisement expenses  lower headcount related expenses  and lower share based compensation expense 
the increase in sales expenses was due primarily to higher project related services  partially offset by lower headcount related expenses and lower share based compensation expense 
the decline in headcount related expenses for both sales and marketing was in part attributable to our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal g a expenses fiscal compared with fiscal g a expenses decreased in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  primarily due to the absence in the current year of million of impairment charges on real estate held for sale recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal lower share based compensation expense in fiscal and a recovery in the market value of property held for sale recorded during fiscal also contributed to the decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by higher headcount related expenses resulting in part from our acquisitions and also by higher corporate level expenses 
corporate level expenses  which tend to vary from period to period  
table of contents included operational infrastructure activities such as it project implementations  which included investments in our global data center infrastructure  and investments related to operational and financial systems 
fiscal compared with fiscal g a expenses increased in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  primarily due to a net increase of approximately million in real estate charges  primarily for impairments on real estate held for sale  followed by other increased corporate level expenses

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in share based compensation expense for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of share based awards granted in recent periods  the timing of the annual grants to employees in fiscal  and stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value 

table of contents amortization of purchased intangible assets the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses in millions years ended july  july  july  amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal and from our other fiscal acquisitions  partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized during fiscal the decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to the absence of significant impairment charges during fiscal and also due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired in fiscal the impairment charges in fiscal were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain products from our then consumer product lines 
for additional information regarding purchased intangible assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of acquired technology and patents  as well as acquired technology under development  is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate 
we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high technology communications industry  and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets

table of contents provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates  higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates  and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives 
our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries 
if these earnings were distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise  or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred  we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
further  as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments  our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax 
our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 
fiscal compared with fiscal the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of for fiscal  compared with for fiscal the net percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a net tax benefit of million  or percentage points  due to a tax settlement with the irs and an increase in tax benefits of million  or percentage points  due to the retroactive reinstatement of the us federal r d tax credit in fiscal for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes  see note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet  our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends  our contractual obligations  and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions july  july  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents fixed income securities publicly traded equity securities total the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of billion  an increase from billion provided for fiscal  and issuance of common stock of billion pursuant to employee stock incentive plans 
these sources of cash were partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions of billion  cash dividends paid of billion  the repurchase of common stock of billion under the stock repurchase program  and capital expenditures of billion 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in net income 
our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was billion and billion as of july  and july   respectively 
under current tax laws and regulations  if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the united states were to be distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
the balance available in the united states as of july  and july  was billion and billion  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire sourcefire  which will reduce our current balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the united states by approximately billion upon completion of the acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
we classify our investments as short term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations 
we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong  with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment grade securities 
we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies  for acquisitions  for customer financing activities  for working capital needs  and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 
free cash flow and capital allocation in august  as part of our capital allocation strategy  we announced our intent to return a minimum of of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock  which objective we accomplished in fiscal we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment 
the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions years ended july  july  july  net cash provided by operating activities acquisition of property and equipment free cash flow we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity  the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables  inventory and supply chain management  deferred revenue  excess tax benefits resulting from share based compensation  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments 
for additional discussion  see part i  item a 
risk factors in this report 

table of contents we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases 
we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to  among other things  invest in our business  make strategic acquisitions  repurchase common stock  and pay dividends on our common stock  after deducting capital investments 
a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period 
in addition  we have other required uses of cash  including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness 
free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles  and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 
the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions  except per share amounts dividends stock repurchase program total years ended per share amount shares weighted average price per share amount amount july  july  july  on september   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per common share to be paid on october  to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on october  accounts receivable  net the following table summarizes our accounts receivable  net in millions  and dso july  july  increase decrease accounts receivable  net dso our accounts receivable net  as of july  increased by approximately compared with the end of fiscal our dso as of july  was higher by days compared with the end of fiscal  primarily due to the timing of product shipments  as a higher proportion of shipments were made in the latter part of the fourth quarter in fiscal inventory supply chain the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions  except annualized inventory turns july  july  increase decrease inventories annualized inventory turns purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers inventory as of july  decreased by from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal  and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 
on a combined basis  inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were flat compared with the end of fiscal the inventory decrease was primarily due to lower levels of manufactured finished goods  which in turn was due in part to inventory sold as part of the sale of our linksys product line 
the increase in purchase commitments in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  was driven primarily by new product introductions and an increase in customer demand 
we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts 
our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods 
distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers 
manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build to order and build to stock products 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply  we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity 
a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  noncancelable  and unconditional commitments 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  
table of contents and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
our purchase commitments are for short term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity 
inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 
financing receivables and guarantees we measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue 
as of july   our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows in millions financing receivables financing guarantees total july  lease receivables loan receivables financed service contracts and other total channel partner end user customers total gross amount less unearned income allowance for credit loss deferred revenue net balance sheet exposure financing receivables gross financing receivables less unearned income increased by compared with the end of fiscal the change was primarily due to a increase in lease receivables and an increase in financed service contracts and other  partially reduced by an decline in loan receivables 
we provide financing to certain end user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products  services  and networking solutions 
these financing arrangements include leases  financed service contracts  and loans 
arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets 
lease receivables include sales type and direct financing leases 
we also provide certain qualified customers financing for long term service contracts  which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services 
our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 
we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 
financing guarantees in the normal course of business  third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs 
the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years 
in some cases  we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements 
the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short term financing provided by third parties  generally with payment terms ranging from to days 
in certain instances  these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party 
the receivables are derecognized upon transfer  as these transfers qualify as true sales  and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms 
these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners  and in some cases  we guarantee a portion of these arrangements 
we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end user customers 
historically  our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial 
where we provide a guarantee  we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies  or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees 
in either case  the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed 
deferred revenue related to financing receivables and guarantees the majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts 
the majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts  which primarily relates to technical support services  is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed 
a portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met

the amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was million and million as of july  and july   respectively 
commercial paper in fiscal  we established a short term debt financing program of up to billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes 
as of july  and july  we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program 
credit facility on february   we terminated our then existing credit facility and entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on february  any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to  based on certain conditions  either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus  bank of america s prime rate as announced from time to time  or one month libor plus or ii libor plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard poor s financial services  llc and moody s investors service  inc the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants  including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
as of july   we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants  and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 
we may also  upon the agreement of either the then existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement  increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional billion and or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to february  deferred revenue the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions july  july  increase decrease service product total reported as current noncurrent total the increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals  partially reduced by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue 
the increase in deferred product revenue was primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously 
in addition  we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july  in millions payments due by period july  total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase obligations long term debt other long term liabilities total by period other long term liabilities uncertainty in the timing of future payments total operating leases for more information on our operating leases  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  noncancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we record a liability for firm  noncancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory 
see further discussion in inventory supply chain 
as of july   the liability for these purchase commitments was million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 
other purchase obligations other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers  for which we have not received the goods or services 
purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 
long term debt the amount of long term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other long term liabilities other long term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable  accrued liabilities for deferred compensation  noncurrent deferred tax liabilities  and certain other long term liabilities 
due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments  our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately  million and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table 
noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other commitments in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases  we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreed upon technology  development  product  or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds  some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed upon milestones  and some of which are required to be funded on demand 
the funding commitments were million as of july   compared with million as of july  insieme networks  inc in the third quarter of fiscal  we made an investment in insieme  an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market 
as set forth in the agreement between cisco and insieme  this investment includes million of funding and a license to certain of our technology 
in addition  pursuant to a november amendment to the agreement between cisco and insieme  we agreed to invest an additional million in insieme upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
as of july   we owned approximately of insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of insieme in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in connection with this investment  we have entered into a put call option agreement that provides us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in insieme 
in addition  the noncontrolling interest holders can require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events 
if we acquire the remaining interests of insieme  the noncontrolling interest holders are eligible to receive two milestone payments  which will be determined using agreed upon formulas based on revenue for certain of insieme s products 
we will begin recognizing the amounts due under the milestone payments when it is determined that such payments are probable of being earned  which may occur in the first half of fiscal when such a determination is made  the milestone payments will then be recorded as compensation expense by us based on an estimate of the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned  pursuant to a vesting schedule 
subsequent changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned and the continued vesting will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense 
the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately million 
this amount was increased from a previous maximum of million as a result of the november amendment  as the parties recognized that higher staffing levels may be necessary to perform additional product development 
the milestone payments  if earned  are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal and fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off balance sheet arrangements 
in the ordinary course of business  we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers 
these privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities 
we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings  and we have determined that as of july  there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 
vce is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal with emc corporation emc  with investments from vmware  inc vmware and intel corporation 
vce helps organizations leverage best in class technologies and disciplines from cisco  emc  and vmware to enable the transformation to cloud computing 
as of july   our cumulative gross investment in vce was approximately million  inclusive of accrued interest  and our ownership percentage was approximately 
during fiscal  we invested approximately million in vce 
we account for our investment in vce under the equity method  and our portion of vce s net loss is recognized in other income loss  net 
as of july   we have recorded cumulative losses since inceptions from vce of million 
our carrying value in vce as of july  was million 
over the next months  as vce scales its operations  we expect that we will make additional investments in vce and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership 
from time to time  emc and cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of vce to indemnify third parties  such as customers  for monetary damages 
such guarantees were not material as of july  on an ongoing basis  we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance 
as a result of this ongoing assessment  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities 
because we may not control these entities  we may not have the ability to influence these events 
we provide financing guarantees  which are generally for various third party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end user customers 
we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end user customers 
see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under financing receivables and guarantees 
securities lending we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available for sale investments 
these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities  and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis 
the average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal and was billion and billion  respectively 
we require collateral equal to at least of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid  high quality assets 
we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties  and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses 
as of july  and july   we had no outstanding securities lending transactions 
we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements 
liquidity and capital resource requirements based on past performance and current expectations  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  investments  cash generated from operations  and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy  through at least the next months  our liquidity requirements  both in total and domestically  including the following working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  pending acquisitions  stock repurchases  cash dividends  contractual obligations  commitments  principal and interest payments on debt  future customer financings  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations 
there are no other transactions  arrangements  or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of  as well as our requirements for capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks  including interest rate risk  equity price risk  and foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate risk fixed income securities we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk 
at any time  a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates  including the impact from lower credit spreads  could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio 
we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives 
we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july  our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading 
our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks  including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
as of july   of our fixed income securities balance consisted of us government and us government agency securities 
we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 
the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities  including the hedging effects when applicable  as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates 
the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  plus bps  and plus bps 
due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal and fiscal  we did not believe a parallel shift of minus bps or minus bps was relevant 
the hypothetical fair values as of july  and july  are as follows in millions valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of july  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps fixed income securities n a n a valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of july  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps fixed income securities n a n a financing receivables as of july   our financing receivables had a carrying value of billion  compared to billion as of july  as of july   a hypothetical bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately billion  respectively 
debt as of july   we had billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding  which consisted of billion floating rate notes and billion fixed rate notes 
the carrying amount of the senior notes was billion  and the related fair value was billion  which fair value is based on market prices 
as of july   a hypothetical bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt  excluding the billion of hedged debt  by a decrease or increase of billion  respectively 
however  this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed rate debt  which is not hedged 

table of contents equity price risk the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility 
we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio 
our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard poor s index or nasdaq composite index 
these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading 
to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities  we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 
publicly traded equity securities the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio  excluding hedged equity securities  if any 
potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus   and were selected based on potential near term changes in those security prices 
the hypothetical fair values as of july  and july  are as follows in millions valuation of securities given an x decrease in each stock s price fair value as of july  valuation of securities given an x increase in each stock s price publicly traded equity securities valuation of securities given an x decrease in each stock s price fair value as of july  valuation of securities given an x increase in each stock s price publicly traded equity securities investments in privately held companies we have also invested in privately held companies 
these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method 
as of july   the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was million  compared with million at july  some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in  including  among other factors  the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal year end are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions july  july  notional amount fair value notional amount fair value forward contracts purchased sold option contracts purchased sold we conduct business globally in numerous currencies 
the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies  such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non us customers and thereby reduces demand 
a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect 
however  the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 
approximately of our operating expenses are us dollar denominated 
in fiscal  foreign currency fluctuations  net of hedging  decreased our combined r d  sales and marketing  and g a expenses by million  or approximately  compared with fiscal  and in fiscal  they increased our combined r d  sales and marketing  and g a expenses by million  or approximately as compared with fiscal to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non us dollar denominated operating expenses and costs  we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts 
these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons 
in designing a specific hedging approach  we consider several factors  including offsetting exposures  significance of exposures  costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument  and potential effectiveness of the hedge 
the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities 
the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables  investments  and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances 
our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities maturities forward and option contracts forecasted transactions related to operating expenses and service cost of sales up to months forward contracts current assets and liabilities up to months forward contracts net investments in foreign subsidiaries up to months forward contracts long term customer financings up to years we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes
