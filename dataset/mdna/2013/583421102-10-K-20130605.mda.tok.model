we compete in growing global market segments driven by demand for products that are smarter  safer  more energy efficient  and environmentally friendly 
we deliver a strong value proposition to our customers through our willingness to customize sensor solutions  leveraging our innovative portfolio of core technologies and exploiting our low cost manufacturing model based on our year presence in china 
executive summary our vision is to be the supplier of choice to oems and select end users for all their physical sensing needs 
to that end  meas continues to expand our market position as a leading global sensor supplier 
over the past ten years  the compounded annual growth rate cagr of our sales of has exceeded overall market increases 
cagr is calculated by taking the nth root of the total percentage growth rate  where n is the number of years in the period being considered or  
the company s strong recovery since fiscal reflects the positive returns from our significant investments in research and development for new programs and the approximately  invested since june through april in our acquisitions  expanding our product offerings and geographic reach 
the company remains focused on creating long term shareholder value through continued development of innovative technologies and strengthening our market position by expanding customer relationships 
to accomplish this goal  we continue to take measures we believe will result in sales performance in excess of the overall market and generation of positive adjusted earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda 
a core tenant of our long term strategy to increase profitability is to grow the size and scale of the company in order to improve our leverage of sg a expenses 
accordingly  we believe we can achieve adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda as a percent of net sales in fiscal and improve this metric as we grow sales at a higher rate than costs in fiscal and beyond 
additionally  as previously announced  we have negotiated an insourcing agreement with sensata  our largest customer  that establishes minimum  declining volumes with meas through december given sensata carries a lower gross margin than our average  the decline in sensata sales will improve our overall mix and associated margin 
we expect this mix shift to improve our adjusted ebitda margin by to bps over the next three years 
we have implemented aggressive actions that continue to position the company for future growth in sales and profitability  all of which we ultimately expect to translate to enhanced shareholder value 
as part of these continued measures to improve profitability  the company has started implementing a restructuring to consolidate the company s manufacturing operations in scotland to other meas sites  which is expected to  among other things  improve operational efficiencies 
the company expects to record approximately  in restructuring charges associated with the restructuring of its scotland operations  however  the company expects to realize annual cost efficiencies of approximately  beginning in fiscal for a further discussion concerning the restructuring  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe we continue to have one of the strongest product development pipelines in the history of the company  which we expect to lay the foundation for future sales growth 
research and development will continue to play a key role in our efforts to maintain product innovations for new sales and to improve profitability 
our broad range of products and geographic diversity provide the company with a variety of opportunities to leverage technology  products  manufacturing base and our financial performance 
acquisitions are a key component of the company s growth strategy 
consistent with this strategy  the company made six acquisitions since april  on april   the company acquired the capital stock of spectrum  a leader in the design and manufacture of custom temperature probes  high reliability encoders and inertial sensors 
on october   the company acquired certain assets of rtd  a designer and manufacturer of temperature sensors and probes based in ham lake  minnesota 
on april   the company acquired the assets of cosense  a long island  new york based manufacturer of ultrasonic sensors and switches used in semiconductor  medical  aerospace and industrial applications 
on october   the company completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of timesquest limited  a holding company and the sole shareholder of gentech  a designer and manufacturer of position sensors used largely for tank liquid level measurement  including urea tank level in heavy truck scr systems sensor based in ayrshire  scotland 
on september   the company purchased the stock of celesco  a manufacturer of a range of position sensors  including short and long stroke string pot  linear potentiometer and rotary sensors 
on july   the company purchased the assets of eureka  a manufacturer of a multi probe sensor for monitoring water quality 
trends there are a number of trends that we expect to materially affect our future operating results  including changing global economic conditions with the resulting impact on our sales  profitability  and capital spending  changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  shifts in our taxable income between tax jurisdictions and the resulting impact on our overall effective tax rate  changes in our debt levels and applicable interest rates  and prices of raw materials and other costs  such as labor 
additionally  our earnings could be impacted by changes in the fair value of acquisition earn out contingencies and furthermore  sales and results of operations could be impacted by additional acquisitions and the impact of restructurings 
overall  the company expects solid sales growth for fiscal  in spite of the impact of an in sourcing arrangement with sensata and the continued effect on sales since many customers remain cautious due to challenging economic conditions with  among other factors  the euro zone debt crisis and continued slow economic growth in certain markets 
as discussed in item of our quarterly report on form q filed on february   the company has worked closely with sensata  our largest customer and a large automotive supplier  on an in sourcing program  whereby a majority of our business will be manufactured by sensata under a royalty arrangement 
the agreement with sensata is expected to result in an overall improvement in our gross margins by approximately to basis points over the next two to three years 
the impact on our sales in fiscal is expected to be a decrease of approximately  in net sales 
as a result of continued limited customer visibility in product demand and the impact of the long term supply agreement with sensata  we have set our outlook for sales accordingly including acquisitions made in fiscal and the recent acquisition of spectrum made in april  the company expects to generate sales of approximately  to  for fiscal we remain positive with regard to sales contribution coming from product developments and expect solid contributions over the next several years driven by key development programs  including urea level quality sensors  digital temperature sensors and new barometric pressure sensors  which we have discussed on our past several investor calls 
one key development program in particular relates to increased diesel emission standards 
all diesel truck and eventually passenger car oems are migrating to selective catalytic reduction systems scr  which inject urea into the exhaust stream to reduce nox emissions 
we expect oems to implement urea quality sensors over the next years in the us in europe  to achieve new standards set in euro c in  we believe eu oems will integrate urea quality monitoring as well as push for continuous level in tank as ways to improve system efficiency and close the monitoring dosing loop 
china is several years behind us and eu emission standards  so requirements for urea quality in china should phase in after additionally  we expect the sensor market will continue to perform well relative to the overall economy as a result of the increase in sensor content in various products across most end markets in the us  europe and asia 
sensor content continues to increase at a faster rate than overall product unit growth  as oems add intelligence in products across most market verticals to promote improved energy efficiency and cleaner technologies  to meet regulatory compliance requirements and to improve user safety and convenience 
the following graph details the company s quarterly net sales and adjusted ebitda over the previous two years 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is not in accordance with  or an alternative to  measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company believes certain financial measures which meet the definition of non gaap financial measures provide important supplemental information 
the company considers adjusted ebitda an important financial measure because it provides a financial measure of the quality of the company s earnings from a cash flow perspective prior to taking into account the effects of changes in working capital and purchases of property and equipment and debt service 
other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  which might limit its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda is used by management in addition to and in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with gaap 
additionally  we believe quarterly adjusted ebitda provides the current run rate for trending purposes rather than a trailing twelve month historical amount 
the following table details quarterly net sales and also provides a non gaap reconciliation of quarterly adjusted ebitda to the applicable gaap financial measures 
quarter ended net sales quarterly adjusted ebitda quarterly adjusted ebitda margin income loss from continuing operations interest foreign currency exchange loss gain depreciation and amortization income taxes share based compensation other adjusted ebitda income from continuing operations before interest  foreign currency exchange loss gain  depreciation and amortization  income taxes  share based compensation and other 
other represents legal fees incurred related to certain international traffic in arms regulations matters  professional fees related to acquisitions  impairment of asset held for sale  restructuring and fair value adjustments to earn out contingencies 
adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda divided by net sales 
for the quarter ended september   professional fees were  impairment of asset held for sale  restructuring costs of and income from the fair value adjustments to earn out contingencies was  for the quarter ended december   restructuring costs totaled and professional fees were for the quarter ended march   restructuring costs totaled  professional fees were and income from fair value adjustments to earn outs of the primary factors that impact our costs of sales include production and sales volumes  product sales mix  foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the price of raw materials  china wage rate increases and the impact of various cost control measures 
although we expect continued pressures on our gross margins given our expectation that costs  including raw material and labor costs  will increase  we expect product mix to improve  largely due to lower sensata sales and sales growth of other more profitable product lines  and expect to continue to increase leverage of our fixed manufacturing overhead 
also impacting our costs  as part of the company s ongoing efforts to review our business for opportunities to reduce operating expenses and leverage core competencies  the company has started implementing a restructuring to consolidate all of the company s manufacturing operations in scotland to other meas sites 
the restructuring includes initiatives designed to centralize certain operating activities  and is expected to  among other things  improve operational efficiencies and performance 
the scottish restructuring could change but is expected to be implemented over the next to months 
costs associated with this restructuring will include payments for severance charges  costs for termination of benefits and other related activities  in addition to possible contract termination  all of which will be reported in the statement of operations as restructuring costs 
at march   the company recorded a liability for an estimate of for severance costs related to the facility closure in scotland  and the company expects to incur additional severance costs with the scottish restructuring plan of approximately during the next twelve months 
costs for the scottish restructurings incurred through march  total  and total cumulative restructuring costs are expected to total approximately  for a further discussion concerning the scottish restructuring  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect our overall gross margins  excluding costs associated with the restructuring in scotland  to range from approximately to  during fiscal  though gross margins for certain quarters could be outside this expected range 
as with all manufacturers  our gross margins are sensitive to the overall volume of business ie  economies of scale in that certain costs are fixed 
during the year ended march   the rmb appreciated approximately  and during fiscal  the rmb appreciated approximately relative to the us dollar 
there are indications this trend may continue in the near term 
we estimate in for every increase in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar  our gross margins decline by approximately  total selling  general and administrative expenses total sg a as a percentage of net sales were higher in fiscal as compared to the prior year  mainly reflecting increases in acquisition related expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets  as well as restructuring costs 
long term  the company plans to continue to control costs and leverage our sg a expenses by growing sales at a higher rate than sg a expenses 
as a percent of sales  total sg a was approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in  we expect a decrease in our sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales  assuming no new acquisitions  mainly due to higher sales  which we expect to be partially offset by continued investment in r d for new programs  increased amortization expense from recent acquisitions and restructuring costs 
amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred financing costs increased over the past three years mainly due to acquisitions 
amortization is disproportionately loaded more in the initial years of the acquisition  and therefore amortization expense is higher in the quarters immediately following a transaction  and declines in later years based on how various intangible assets are valued and the differing useful lives for which the respective intangible assets are amortized 
for example  backlog is amortized over a period less than year and patents are amortized over a weighted average life of years 
amortization of acquired intangible assets for fiscal is expected to approximate the level of amortization expense in fiscal  excluding amortization of intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions in fiscal and no significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition to margin exposure  the company also has foreign currency exchange exposures related to balance sheet accounts 
when foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  there is a resulting revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated and accounted for in foreign currencies other than the subsidiary s functional currency  resulting in foreign currency exchange fx losses or gains 
for example  our swiss company  which uses the swiss franc or chf as its functional currency  holds cash denominated in foreign currencies us dollar and euro 
as the swiss franc appreciates against the us dollar and or euro  the cash balances held in those denominations are devalued when stated in terms of swiss francs 
these fx transaction gains and losses are reflected in our foreign currency exchange gain or loss 
aside from cash  our foreign and domestic entities hold receivables and payables in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange losses or gains due to the revaluation of local subsidiary balance sheet accounts with realized and unrealized fx transactions fluctuated from a loss last year to a net gain this year 
during the year ended march   the company recorded net fx gain of  which reflects fx gains in europe resulting from the fluctuation of the euro relative to the us dollar offset by fx losses in asia with the appreciation of the rmb 
we recorded net fx gains of in and net fx losses of in the company s operations outside of the us and the volume of business denominated in other currencies have expanded over the years from acquisitions 
we expect to see continued fx losses or gains associated with volatility of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses and may continue to use foreign currency contracts to hedge these fx exposures 
the company does not hedge all of its fx exposures  but has accepted some exposure to exchange rate movements 
the company does not apply hedge accounting when derivative financial instruments are used to manage these fx exposures 
since the company does not apply hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of those derivative financial instruments are reported in earnings in the fx gains or losses caption 
we expect the value of the us dollar will continue to fluctuate relative to the rmb  euro  swiss franc and british pound 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amounts of sales  profits  and assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
we believe the company has a relatively low overall effective cash tax rate with the utilization of our nols  as well as an overall low effective tax rate due to the low tax rates afforded to the company in several tax jurisdictions in which we operate  including china  ireland and switzerland 
our overall effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate as a result of the shift in earnings among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and their varying tax rates 
this is particularly challenging due to the different timing and rates of economic activity around the world 
we expect our overall estimated effective tax rate without discrete tax adjustments to range from approximately to approximately  an increase as compared to the prior year 
the increase in the estimated overall effective tax rate mainly reflects a higher proportion of taxable earnings to tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates 
the overall estimated effective tax rate is based on expectations and other estimates and involves complex domestic and foreign tax issues  which the company monitors closely  but are subject to change 
the company s subsidiary in china  meas china  received approval from the chinese authorities for high new technology enterprise hnte status through december  hnte status decreased the tax rate for meas china from to 
to qualify for this reduced rate the company must continue to meet various criteria in regard to its operations related to sales  research and development activity  and intellectual property rights 
if the company does not continue to receive hnte status  the company s income tax rate in china would increase to 
the company plans to continue investing in various capital projects in fiscal to generate higher sales in new and expanded programs  and expects these expenditures to range between and of sales 
this range of expected capital expenditures excludes investments in the new greenfield manufacturing facility in china and other such facility investments  such as the purchase of a facility to replace a leased facility or to expand an existing facility 
there is no specific timeline or commitment to acquire a facility  but the company does from time to time contemplate making such facility investments 
the company s investment in the new greenfield manufacturing facility in chengdu  china will continue through fiscal the chengdu facility is expected to be cost approximately  excluding vat  of which has been incurred to date 
as part of the transition to new facility  the company expects to temporarily increase certain inventory levels 
asset held for sale and impairment of asset held for sale with the purchase of psi  the company acquired an additional facility in hampton  virginia 
the company completed the consolidation of the former psi facility into the existing meas hampton facility 
since may  the psi facility was no longer utilized for manufacturing and is held for sale 
accordingly  the former psi facility is classified as an asset held for sale since it meets the held for sale criteria under the applicable accounting guidelines 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company concluded it had a triggering event requiring assessment of impairment since the former psi facility had not been sold and overall economic trends and market conditions not being positive for commercial real estate 
as a result  the company reviewed the asset for impairment and recorded a impairment charge 
based on continued softening of the real estate market in hampton  virginia  the company re assessed the market value of the asset held for sale and as a result  the company recorded an additional impairment charge of during the three months ended september  to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
the inputs utilized in the analysis are classified as level inputs within the fair value hierarchy as defined in the related accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures 
the carrying value of the former psi facility is as of march   and approximates fair value less cost to sell 
changes in our business acquisitions  divestures and restructurings as described in the executive summary above  the company made six acquisitions through april since april  see item i 
business of this annual report on form k for further details concerning the sale of the consumer segment to fervent group limited fgl  effective december  accordingly  the related financial statements detailed in item select financial data of this annual report on form k for the consumer segment are reported as discontinued operations 
all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended march   and  and consolidated balance sheets as of march  and  exclude the results of these discontinued operations 
the company has started implementing a restructuring to consolidate all of the company s manufacturing operations in scotland to other meas sites 
these restructuring activities are expected to  among other things  improve operational efficiencies 
for a further discussion concerning the scottish restructuring  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards in june  the fasb issued new accounting standards for reporting comprehensive income 
the new accounting standards revise only the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements and require that net income and other comprehensive income be reported either in a single  continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
presentation of components of comprehensive income in the statements as changes in stockholders equity will no longer be allowed 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the new accounting standards for reporting comprehensive income with the deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive  which defers the changes that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
these new reporting requirements were effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   which is the company s fiscal year 
early adoption of the standard was permitted 
the company applied the new reporting requirements effective april  in september  the fasb issued new guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
entities will have an option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of their reporting units 
if  based on the qualitative assessment  an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  quantitative testing for impairment is not necessary 
the new accounting standard is applicable for goodwill impairment testing performed in years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
the company applied the new reporting requirements effective april  recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued new accounting standards for reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
under this standard  entities will be required to disclose additional information with respect to changes in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci balances by component and significant items reclassified out of aoci 
expanded disclosures for presentation of changes in aoci involve disaggregating the total change of each component of other comprehensive income for example  unrealized gains or losses on available for sale marketable securities as well as presenting separately for each such component the portion of the change in aoci related to amounts reclassified into income and current period other comprehensive income 
additionally  for amounts reclassified into income  disclosure in one location would be required  based upon each specific aoci component  of the amounts impacting individual income statement line items 
disclosure of the income statement line item impacts will be required only for components of aoci reclassified into income in their entirety 
therefore  disclosure of the income statement line items affected by aoci components such as net periodic benefit costs would not be included 
the disclosures required with respect to income statement line item impacts would be made in either the notes to the consolidated financial statements or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements 
the company will apply these new accounting standards effective beginning april  since this standard only impacts presentation and disclosure requirements  its adoption will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
management has reviewed the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates and assumptions with the company s audit committee of the board of directors 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of sensors and sensor based systems 
in order for revenue and related cost of sales from product sales to be recognized there must persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company s standard terms are fob shipping point  but a portion of our customers have fob destination terms 
based on the above criteria  revenue is recognized depending on the specific terms of the arrangement either at the point of shipment for those sales under fob shipping point terms or when it is received by the customer for sales under fob destination terms 
for those transactions that are shipped at or near the end of the reporting period for which the sales terms are fob destination  the company confirms receipt of the shipment  and if delivery has not occurred  then the revenue is not recognized 
product sales are recorded net of trade discounts at the point of sale including volume and early payment incentives because these allowances reflect a reduction in the price for the products  sales returns  value added tax and similar taxes 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenue  and shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales 
sales to customers generally include a right of return 
the company provides for allowances for returns based upon historical and estimated return rates 
sales returns have not historically been significant to our revenues and have been within the estimates made by management 
the amount of actual returns could differ from estimates 
changes in estimated returns would be accounted for in the period of change 
many of our products are designed and engineered to meet customer specifications  and customer arrangements do not involve post installation or post sale testing and acceptance 
there is no significant variation in sales terms geographically  or among product lines and industries 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm 
for purposes of analyzing the lcm  market is current replacement cost 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates historical cost under the first in  first out method 
market cannot exceed the net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicted costs of completion and disposal and market shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin 
in evaluating lcm  management also considers  if applicable  other factors as well  including known trends  market conditions  currency exchange rates and other such issues 
if the utility of goods is impaired by damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in price levels or other causes  a loss shall be charged as cost of sales in the period which it occurs 
the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to our operations include slowdown in customer demand  customer delay in the issuance of sales orders  miscalculation of customer requirements  technology changes that render raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
generally  products that have existed in inventory for months with no usage and that have no current demand or no expected demand  will be considered obsolete and fully reserved 
obsolete inventory approved for disposal is written off against the reserve 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters  which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may be necessary for additional inventory reserves and write downs  which would be accounted for in the period of change 
the level of inventory reserves reflects the nature of the industry whereby technological and other changes  such as customer buying requirements  result in impairment of inventory 
cash flows from the purchase and sale of inventory are included in cash flows from operating activities 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at fiscal year end or more frequently under certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the implied fair value approach or a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed and goodwill is not impaired 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  the fair value of the company s reporting unit was determined using the implied fair value approach for fiscal years ended march   and the implied fair value approach consists of comparing the company s market capitalization to the company s book value  and if the market capitalization exceeds book value  there is no impairment of goodwill 
based on our analyses and the applicable guidelines  there was no impairment of the company s goodwill at march    and acquisitions acquisitions are recorded as of the purchase date  and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in all acquisitions  the purchase price of the acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the fair values of these items are based upon management s best estimates using various valuation approaches  including the relief from royalty method  cost approach and income approach  depending on the circumstances 
certain of the acquired assets are intangible in nature  including customer relationships  patented and proprietary technology  covenants not to compete  trade names and order backlog  which are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
there can be acquisition related contingent payment obligations  which are based on certain financial thresholds  for which the company records at estimated fair value 
the estimated fair values for such earn outs are based on a number of key assumptions and actual amounts could differ significantly 
changes to the estimated fair value of earn out after the measurement period are recorded to earnings 
the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets is recorded as goodwill 
all such valuation methodologies  including the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
purchased intangibles and goodwill are usually not deductible for tax purposes in stock acquisitions 
however  purchase accounting requires the establishment of deferred tax liabilities on purchased intangible assets excluding goodwill to the extent the carrying value for financial reporting exceeds the tax basis 
long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with standards for accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  decision to restructuring a site  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and significant change in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using projected undiscounted cash flow at the lowest level at which cash flows is identifiable 
in the event impairment is indicated  fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method  appraisal or other accepted techniques 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
other factors could include  among other things  quoted market prices  or other valuation techniques considered appropriate based on the circumstances 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
impairment charges would be included in our consolidated statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
there were no indicators of potential impairment in and requiring impairment charges  except for that relating to the asset held for sale  as previously discussed in the above section concerning asset held for sale 
foreign currency translation and transactions the functional currency of the company s foreign operating companies is the applicable local currency 
in consolidation  the foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss includes net income for the period and the cumulative impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company is subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions  such as receivables and payables 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in foreign currency exchange in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
however  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany notes of a long term investment nature which management does not intend to repay in the foreseeable future are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable income 
the company evaluates all positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required 
the company annually evaluates positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is required 
consideration of current and expected future taxable income of the company indicated that an overall valuation allowance is not needed 
transfer pricing refers to the prices that one member of a group of related companies charges to another member of the group for goods  services  or the use of intellectual property 
the company prepares various transfer pricing studies and other such procedures to assist in determining and supporting transfer pricing 
if two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries  the laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those charged by unrelated companies dealing with each other at arm s length 
if one or more of the countries in which our affiliated companies are located believes that transfer prices were manipulated by our affiliate companies in a way that distorts the true taxable income of the companies  the laws of countries where our affiliated companies are located could require us to re determine transfer prices and thereby reallocate the income of our affiliate companies in order to reflect these transfer prices 
any reallocation of income from one of our companies in a lower tax jurisdiction to an affiliated company in a higher tax jurisdiction would result in a higher overall tax liability to us 
moreover  if the country from which the income is being reallocated does not agree to the reallocation  the same income could be subject to taxation by both countries 
contingencies and litigation liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimates that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
share based payments the company has five active share based compensation plans  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the company receives a tax deduction for certain stock options and stock option exercises during the period the options are exercised  generally for the excess of the fair value of the stock over the exercise price of the options at the exercise date 
the company is required to report excess tax benefits from the award of equity instruments as financing cash flows 
for purposes of measuring the tax benefit related to stock options  the company applied the tax law ordering approach  whereby the tax benefits were considered realized for current year exercises of share based compensation awards 
these amounts are considered realized because such deductions offset taxable income on the company s tax return  thereby reducing the amount of income subject to tax 
when the tax deduction exceeds the compensation expense  the tax benefit associated with any excess deduction is considered an excess tax benefit  or windfall 
the windfall portion of the share based compensation deduction reduces income tax payable and is credited to additional paid in capital apic 
the windfall credited to apic increases the company s apic pool available to offset future tax deficiencies shortfalls 
shortfalls are the amount the compensation expense exceeds the tax deduction

organic sales  defined as net sales excluding sales attributed to the eureka  celesco  gentech  cosense and rtd acquisitions of  for the year ended march  and excluding sales of  attributed to eureka  celesco and gentech for the year ended march   increased  or 
sales increases were in all sensor product lines  except optical  position  vibration and temperature  with the largest increases in sales to humidity  pressure  piezo and sensata 
the overall increase in organic sales is mainly due to new sales from broader product adoptions and new programs  partially offset by weak macro economic environmental conditions and the translation decrease in sales from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in sales to sensata was not as high as the prior year  and sales to sensata are expected to decline in future periods due to a customer insourcing program whereby a majority of our sensata business will be manufactured by sensata under a royalty arrangement 
also impacting sales is the continued uncertainty and cautiousness with customers across most markets  particularly with the financial instability in europe 
we expect the sensor market to continue to perform well relative to the overall economy as a result of the increase in sensor content in various products across most end markets in the us  europe and asia 
sensor content continues to increase at a faster rate than overall product unit growth  as oems add intelligence in products across most market verticals to promote improved energy efficiency and cleaner technologies  to meet regulatory compliance requirements and to improve user safety and convenience 
partially offsetting the increase in sales is the translation decrease in sales resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if the average us dollar euro exchange rate had not changed during the twelve months ended march  as compared to the twelve months ended march   the company s organic net sales would have been higher by approximately  since a portion of the company s sales are denominated in euros and translated into us dollars  there can be a translation decrease or a translation increase in the company s net sales depending on changes in exchange rates 
the us dollar appreciated relative to the euro in comparing average exchange rates for the twelve months ended march  to the twelve months ended march  for example   is translated to  based on the twelve month weighted average exchange rate ended march   but the same  is translated to  using twelve month average exchange rate ended march  gross margin gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to approximately from approximately 
the increase in gross margin is mainly due to  among other factors  improved product sales mix and lower scrap  partially offset by increases in direct labor costs and the appreciation of the rmb 
the company sold a larger proportion of products with higher gross margins as compared to the prior year  mainly reflecting the increase in sales from acquisitions and the decline in the proportionate level of sales to sensata 
in comparing fiscal to  the rmb appreciated approximately relative to the us dollar 
this translates to an annualized decrease in profits of approximately based on an estimate decrease in our operating income of approximately  for every appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar 
on a continuing basis  our gross margin may vary due to product mix  sales volume  availability and cost of raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates  and other factors

the increase in r d costs is mostly due to the company s continued investment in new programs 
the decrease in customer funding of tooling and other r d is due to a variety of factors  including economic factors with the largest decreases in europe and asia  as well the completion of a number of non recurring development programs during the prior year

foreign currency exchange gains and losses foreign currency exchange gains and losses represent the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates with  among other things  the revaluation of balance sheet accounts and foreign currency contracts

for example  our irish subsidiary  which uses the euro as its functional currency  holds cash denominated in foreign currencies  including the us dollar 
as the euro appreciates against the us dollar  the cash balances held in other denominations are devalued when stated in terms of euro  resulting in a foreign currency exchange loss 
the increase in the foreign currency exchange gain is mainly due to the foreign currency exchange gains recorded with the favorable fluctuations of the european currencies relative to the us dollar with the company s european operations  partially offset by the lower foreign exchange losses with the fluctuation of the rmb relative to the us dollar

key assumptions include discount rates for present value factor  which are based on industry specific weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for  among other things  time and risk  as well as forecasted annual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and forecasted annual revenues over the life of the earn outs 
adjustments to the fair value of earn outs are recorded to earnings with that portion of the adjustment relating to the time value of money as interest expense and the non interest portion of the change in earn outs as a separate non operating item in the statement of operations 
as a result of the assessment of actual and projected earnings and sales scenarios  the company determined that eureka s earnings and gentech s sales were expected not to reach estimated earn out levels

seasonality as a whole  there is no material seasonality in our sales 
however  general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results  and certain end use markets experience certain seasonality 
for example  european sales are often lower in summer months and oem sales are often stronger immediately preceding and following the introduction of new products 
inflation we compete on the basis of product design  features  and value 
accordingly  our prices generally have kept pace with inflation  notwithstanding that inflation in the countries where our subsidiaries are located has been consistently higher than inflation in the united states 
we have recently experienced increases in material and labor costs  including the direct impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and as a result  we have had pressure on our margins 
off balance sheet arrangments we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
the company does have an unconsolidated joint venture in japan  n t  which is not considered to be a special purpose entity or variable interest entity for the purposes of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or such limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
the company has acquired and divested of certain assets  including the acquisition of businesses and the sale of the consumer business 
in connection with these acquisitions and divestiture  the company often provides and receives representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities  such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters  commercial disputes  environmental matters or tax matters 
the company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations  warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  the company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations  warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
aggregate contractual obligations as of march   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows contractual obligations payment due by period total year years years years long term debt obligations   interest obligation on long term debt   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations   health care self insurance liability other long term obligations    total      other long term obligations on the company s balance sheet under gaap primarily consist of obligations under warranty polices  foreign currency contracts  acquisition earn outs  restructuring liabilities  contractual obligations related to the construction of new facilities and tax liabilities 
the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management s estimate over the terms of these arrangements and are largely based on historical experience 
the above contractual obligation table excludes certain contractual obligations  such as possible severance payments to certain executives  since these contractual commitments are not accrued as liabilities at march  or are otherwise indeterminable 
these contractual obligations are accrued as liabilities when the respective contingencies are determinable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in  among other things  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity  credit risk  and health insurance claims  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company attempts to address its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities 
in addition  the company s broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 
interest rate risk under our term and revolving credit facilities  we are exposed to a certain level of interest rate risk 
interest on the principal amount of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility loan accrue at a rate based on either a libor or euribor based rate plus a margin or at an indexed prime based rate plus a margin 
the libor  euribor or index rate is at our election 
our results will be adversely affected by any increase in interest rates 
for example  based on the  of total debt outstanding under the revolver credit facility at march   an annual interest rate increase of percent would increase interest expense and decrease our pre tax profitability by  interest on the principal amounts of our borrowings under our term loans accrue at fixed rates 
if interest rates decline  the company would not be able to benefit from the lower rates on our long term debt 
we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure 
commodity risk the company uses a wide range of commodities in our products  including steel  non ferrous metals and petroleum based products  as well as other commodities required for the manufacture of our sensor products 
changes in the pricing of commodities directly affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we attempt to pass increases in commodity costs to our customers  and we do not currently hedge such commodity price exposures 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments  foreign currency forward contracts and trade accounts receivable 
the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments 
the company places cash and temporary investments with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world 
although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations  it does periodically monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
in addition  concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the company s customers 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and the company does not obtain collateral  insurance or other security 
notwithstanding these efforts  the current distress in the global economy may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from the company s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries  as well as from transactions in currencies other than the business functional currency 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
a appreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at march  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately  the effect of a change in currency exchange rates from transactions in currencies other than the business functional currency is reflected in foreign currency exchange gain or loss 
the company s primary transactional foreign currency exposures relate to the us dollar relative to the rmb  euro and british pounds 
a percent appreciation of the rmb  british pound and euro relative to the us dollar for the company s net us dollar exposure in those currencies at march   would result in foreign currency losses of approximately   and with the rmb  euro  british pound and swiss franc  respectively 
although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes  it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a large portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies 
a substantial portion of our revenues are priced in us dollars  and most of our costs and expenses are priced in us dollars  with the remaining priced in chinese rmb  euros  swiss francs and british pound 
sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
as a result  the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar 
accordingly  the competitiveness of our products relative to products produced locally in foreign markets may be affected by the performance of the us dollar compared with that of our foreign customers currencies 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information concerning annual net sales invoiced from our facilities within the us and outside of the us and as a percentage of total net sales for the last three years  as well as net assets and the related functional currencies 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales  profit  and assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
during  the rmb appreciated approximately relative to the us dollar 
the rmb appreciated approximately and during and  respectively 
the chinese government no longer pegs the rmb to the us dollar  but established a currency policy letting the rmb trade in a narrow band against a basket of currencies 
the company has more expenses denominated in rmb than sales denominated in rmb ie  short rmb position  and as such  when the us dollar weakens relative to the rmb  our operating profits decrease 
based on our net exposure of rmb to us dollars for the fiscal year ended march  and forecast information for fiscal  we estimate an annualized negative operating income impact of approximately  for every percent appreciation in rmb against the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and no associated cost increases or currency hedging 
we continue to consider various alternatives to hedge this exposure  and we are attempting to manage this exposure through  among other things  forward purchase contracts  pricing and monitoring balance sheet exposures for payables and receivables 
fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar have not been significant since october   when the hong kong government tied the value of the hong kong dollar to that of the us dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that the value of the hong kong dollar will continue to be tied to that of the us dollar 
the company s french  irish and german subsidiaries have more expense denominated in euros than sales denominated in euros and the company s swiss subsidiary has more expenses denominated in swiss francs than sales denominated in swiss francs 
as such  if the us dollar weakens relative to the euro and swiss franc  our operating profits decrease in france  ireland  germany and switzerland 
based on the net exposures of euros and swiss francs to the us dollars for the fiscal year ended march   we estimate an annualized negative operating income impact of approximately and for every percent appreciation in the euro and swiss franc  respectively  relative to the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and associated cost increases or currency hedging 
with the purchase of gentech  the company added an operating entity with the british pound as the functional currency 
based on our estimated net exposure of british pounds to us dollars for the period ended march  and forecast information for fiscal  we estimate an annualized negative impact of to operating income for every appreciation of the british pound against the us dollar for fiscal the company has entered into a number of foreign currency exchange contracts in china in an attempt to hedge the company s exposure to the rmb 
the rmb us dollar currency contracts have gross notional amounts totaling  with exercise dates through june  at an average exchange rate of rmb to us dollar conversion rate 
with these rmb us dollar contracts  for every percent depreciation of the rmb or a percent appreciation of the rmb  the company would be exposed to an additional fx gains and losses  respectively  of approximately  since these derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes  changes in their fair value are recorded in the results of operations  not in other comprehensive income 
to manage our exposure to potential foreign currency transaction and translation risks  we may purchase additional foreign currency exchange forward contracts  currency options  or other derivative instruments  provided such instruments may be obtained at suitable prices 
risks with acquisition earn out contingencies the company has earn out contingencies in connection with the acquisitions of eureka  gentech and rtd  as described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at march   no amounts were recorded for the acquisition earn out liabilities for eureka and gentech  because the company s assessment indicates that eureka s earnings and gentech s sales are not expected to reach earn out levels 
the acquisition earn out liability for rtd totaled  at march  the estimates of the fair values for the eureka  gentech and rtd earn out liabilities are based on certain assumptions and actual amounts could differ significantly 
changes to these estimates will be recorded to earnings in future periods 
for example  if the earn out contingency with the rtd acquisitions is understated by  we estimate a negative impact to earnings of approximately  or if this earn out contingency is overstated by  we estimate a positive impact to earnings of approximately
