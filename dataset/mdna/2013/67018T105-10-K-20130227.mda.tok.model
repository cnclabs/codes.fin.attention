item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  which are included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading  global direct selling company with operations in markets worldwide 
we develop and distribute innovative  premium quality anti aging personal care products and nutritional supplements under our nu skin and pharmanex category brands  respectively 
over the last several years  we have introduced new pharmanex nutritional supplements and nu skin personal care products under our ageloc anti aging brand 
we strive to secure competitive advantage in four key areas our people  our products  the culture we promote  and the business opportunities we offer 
as of december   we had nearly  active distributors and consumers who purchased products directly from the company during the previous three months actives 
more than  of our actives were qualified sales leaders sales leaders  who are the core of our sales network and play a key role in the growth and development of our business 
in  we posted record revenue of billion 
revenue in grew  driven by sustained interest in our product portfolio  including our ageloc anti aging products  growth in sales leaders and actives  and alignment around our product launch process 
approximately of our revenue came from markets outside the united states 
while we have become more geographically diverse over the past decade  japan  our largest revenue market  accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
due to the size of our foreign operations  our results are often impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  our results are generally impacted by global economic  political  demographic and business trends and conditions 
our revenue depends on the number and productivity of our sales leaders and actives 
we have been successful in attracting and motivating our distributors by developing and marketing innovative  technologically and scientifically advanced products  providing compelling initiatives and strong support  and offering attractive incentives that motivate our distributors to build sales organizations 
our distributors market and sell our products and recruit others based on the distinguishing benefits and innovative characteristics of our products 
as a result  it is vital to our business that we continuously leverage our research and development resources to develop and introduce innovative products and provide our distributors with an attractive portfolio of products 
since  we have successfully introduced a suite of innovative ageloc anti aging skin care and nutritional products  including our ageloc transformation daily skin care system  galvanic spa gels with ageloc  ageloc galvanic spa body shaping gel and ageloc dermatic effects body contouring lotion  ageloc vitality and ageloc r anti aging nutritional supplements 
we are developing additional ageloc anti aging products for the future  including a new ageloc weight management system 
we currently plan to introduce our new ageloc weight management system in the second half of we also offer unique initiatives  products  and business tools  such as our ageloc galvanic spa systems and pharmanex biophotonic scanner  to help distributors effectively differentiate our earnings opportunity and product offerings 
any delays or difficulties in introducing compelling products or attractive initiatives or tools into our markets may have a negative impact on our revenue and our number of actives and sales leaders 

table of contents although our product launch process may vary by market  we generally introduce new products to our distributors and consumers in all markets where the products are registered  through limited time offers in connection with global and regional distributor events 
the limited time offers typically generate significant distributor activity and a high level of purchasing  which may result in a higher than normal increase in revenue during the quarter of the limited time offer and skew year over year and sequential comparisons 
we believe our product launch process attracts new people to our business  driving growth in our sales leaders and actives 
for example  limited time offers of ageloc r and ageloc body spa and related products in connection with a series of regional events generated approximately million in our greater china region and million in our south asia pacific region during the second and third quarters of we typically make a new product generally available within a year following the regional limited time offers 
we currently plan to introduce a new ageloc weight management system in most of our markets through a global limited time offer in the second half of  followed by regional limited time offers in most of our markets during the following year 
we currently anticipate that the size of these limited time offers may increase as our actives grow and the percentage of actives participating in these limited time offers increases 
however  we cannot be sure whether these limited time offers will continue to generate distributor interest and participation  or what the short and long term impact will be on our business 
we may experience difficulty effectively managing growth associated with these limited time offers 
in addition  the size and condensed schedule of these global product launches increases pressure on our supply chain 
if we are unable to accurately forecast sales levels in each market  obtain sufficient ingredients or produce a sufficient supply to meet global demand  we may incur higher expedited shipping costs and we may experience stockouts  which could negatively impact the enthusiasm of our distributors and consumers 
conversely  if we over forecast demand for a global product launch  we could incur increased inventory write offs 
our order processing systems could also have difficulties handling the high volume of orders generated by limited time offers 
although our previous limited time offers have not materially affected our product return rate  these events may increase our product return rate in the future 
our global sales network helps us to rapidly introduce products and penetrate our markets with modest up front promotional expense 
similar to other companies in our industry  we experience a high level of turnover among our distributors 
as a result  it is important that we regularly introduce innovative and compelling products and initiatives in order to maintain a compelling business opportunity that will attract new people to our business 
we have also developed  and continue to promote in many of our markets  product subscription and loyalty programs that provide incentives for consumers to commit to purchase a specific amount of products on a monthly basis 
all purchases under these programs are subject to our standard product payment and return policies 
we believe these subscription and loyalty programs have improved consumer retention  have had a stabilizing impact on revenue  and have helped generate recurring sales 
subscription and loyalty programs represented of our non limited time offer revenue in our business is subject to various laws and regulations globally  particularly with respect to network marketing activities  cosmetics  and nutritional supplements 
accordingly  we face certain risks  including any improper claims or activities of our distributors or any inability to obtain or maintain necessary product registrations 

table of contents income statement presentation we report revenue in five geographic regions and we translate revenue from each market local currency into us dollars using weighted average exchange rates 
the following table sets forth revenue information by region for the periods indicated 
this table should be reviewed in connection with the tables presented under results of operations  which disclose selling expenses and other costs associated with generating the aggregate revenue presented 
revenue by region year ended december  us dollars in millions north asia greater china south asia pacific americas emea cost of sales primarily consists of cost of products purchased from third party vendors  generally in us dollars  costs of self manufactured products  cost of sales materials which we sell to distributors at or near cost  amortization expenses associated with certain products and services such as the pharmanex biophotonic scanners that are leased to distributors  freight cost of shipping products to distributors and import duties for the products  and royalties and related expenses for licensed technologies 
we source the majority of our products from third party manufacturers located in the united states 
due to chinese government restrictions on the importation of finished goods applicable to the current scope of our business in china  we are required to manufacture the bulk of our own products for distribution in china 
cost of sales and gross profit  on a consolidated basis  may fluctuate as a result of changes in the ratio between self manufactured products and products sourced from third party suppliers 
in addition  because we purchase a significant majority of our goods in us dollars and recognize revenue in local currencies  our gross margin is subject to exchange rate risks 
because our gross margins vary from product to product and due to higher pricing in some markets such as japan  changes in product mix and geographic revenue mix can impact our gross margin  on a consolidated basis 
selling expenses are our most significant expense and are classified as operating expenses 
selling expenses include sales commissions paid to our distributors  costs for incentive trips and other rewards  as well as wages  benefits  bonuses and other labor and unemployment expenses we pay to our sales force in china 
our global sales compensation plan  which we employ in all our markets  except china  is an important factor in our ability to attract and retain distributors 
under our global sales compensation plan  sales leaders can earn multi level compensation  where they earn commissions for product sales to their consumer groups as well as the product sales made through the sales network they have developed and trained 
we do not pay commissions on sales materials  which are sold to distributors at or near cost 
small fluctuations occur in the amount of commissions paid as the network of distributors actively purchasing products changes from month to month 
however  with nearly  actives and  sales leaders  the fluctuation in the overall payout is relatively small 
the overall compensation has typically averaged between and of global product sales 
from time to time  we make modifications and enhancements to our global sales compensation plan in an effort to help motivate distributors and develop leadership characteristics  which can have an impact on selling expenses 

table of contents distributors also have the opportunity to make profits by purchasing products from us at a discount and selling them to consumers with a mark up 
we do not account for nor pay additional commissions on these mark ups received by distributors 
in many markets  we also allow individuals who are not distributors  whom we refer to as preferred customers  to buy products directly from us at a discount 
we pay commissions on preferred customer purchases to the referring distributors 
general and administrative expenses include wages and benefits  rents and utilities  depreciation and amortization  promotion and advertising  professional fees  travel  research and development  and other operating expenses 
labor expenses are the most significant portion of our general and administrative expenses 
promotion and advertising expenses include costs of distributor conventions held in various markets worldwide  which we expense in the period in which they are incurred 
because our various distributor conventions are not held during each fiscal year  or in the same period each year  their impact on our general and administrative expenses may vary from year to year and from quarter to quarter 
for example  we held our global convention in october and will have another global convention in the fall of as we currently plan to hold a global convention every other year 
in addition  we hold regional conventions and conventions in our major markets at different times during the year 
these conventions have significant expenses associated with them 
because we have not incurred expenses for these conventions during every fiscal year or in comparable interim periods  year over year comparisons have been impacted accordingly 
provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for example  statutory tax rates in were approximately in hong kong  in taiwan  in south korea  in japan and in china 
we are subject to taxation in the united states at the statutory corporate federal tax rate of and we pay taxes in multiple states within the united states at various tax rates 
our overall effective tax rate was for the year ended december  
table of contents critical accounting policies the following critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
management considers our critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue  accounting for income taxes  accounting for intangible assets and accounting for stock based compensation 
in each of these areas  management makes estimates based on historical results  current trends and future projections 
revenue 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped  which is when title and risk of loss pass to our independent distributors and preferred customers who are our consumers 
with some exceptions in various countries  we offer a return policy whereby distributors can return unopened and unused product for up to months subject to a restocking fee 
reported revenue is net of returns  which have historically been less than of annual revenue 
a reserve for product returns is accrued based on historical experience 
we classify selling discounts as a reduction of revenue 
our selling expenses include commissions paid under our global sales compensation plan  which is focused on remunerating distributors based primarily upon the selling efforts of the distributors and or the volume of products purchased by their sales organization  and not their personal purchases 
through our product subscription and loyalty programs  which can vary from market to market  participants who commit to purchase on a monthly basis receive a discount from suggested retail or wholesale prices  as applicable 
we apply this discount at the time of each purchase and not through a larger discount on the initial purchase 
participants may cancel their commitment at any time  however some markets charge a one time early cancellation fee 
all purchases under these programs are subject to our standard product payment and return policies 
in accordance with asc  we classify selling discounts and rebates  as a reduction of revenue at the time the sale is recorded 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic of the financial accounting standards codification 
these standards establish financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise activities during the current and preceding years 
we take an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
we pay income taxes in many foreign jurisdictions based on the profits realized in those jurisdictions  which can be significantly impacted by terms of intercompany transactions among our affiliates around the world 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are created in this process 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings will exist for their realization  as well as the continued application of current tax rates 
in certain foreign jurisdictions valuation allowances have been recorded against the deferred tax assets specifically related to use of net operating losses 
when we determine that there is sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating losses  the valuation allowances will be released 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
during  we entered into a closing agreement with the united states internal revenue service the irs for all adjustments for the through tax years 
as a result of entering into the closing agreement  we are no longer subject to tax examinations from the irs for years before with a few exceptions  we are no longer subject to state and local income tax examination by tax authorities for the years before in  we entered into a voluntary program with the irs called compliance assurance process cap 
the objective of cap is to contemporaneously work with the irs to achieve federal tax compliance and resolve all or most of the issues prior to filing of the tax return 
we have elected to participate in the cap program for and may elect to continue participating in cap for future tax years  we may withdraw from the program at any time 
in major foreign jurisdictions  we are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years before along with the irs examination  we are currently under examination in certain foreign jurisdictions  however  the outcomes of those reviews are not yet determinable 

table of contents at december   we had million in unrecognized tax benefits of which million  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
in comparison  at december   we had million in unrecognized tax benefits of which million  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
during each of the years ended december  and we recognized approximately million and million in interest and penalties expenses benefits  respectively 
we had approximately million  million and million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions at december   and  respectively 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
we are subject to regular audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
these audits may result in additional tax liabilities 
we account for such contingent liabilities in accordance with relevant accounting standards and believe we have appropriately provided for income taxes for all years 
several factors drive the calculation of our tax reserves 
some of these factors include i the expiration of various statutes of limitations  ii changes in tax law and regulations  iii issuance of tax rulings  and iv settlements with tax authorities 
changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to our reserves  which would impact our reported financial results 
intangible assets 
acquired intangible assets may represent indefinite lived assets  determinable lived intangibles  or goodwill 
of these  only the costs of determinable lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 
the value of indefinite lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles 
we test goodwill for impairment  at least annually  by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reportable unit level 
we test individual indefinite lived intangibles at least annually by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to measure fair value 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill or intangible assets during the periods presented

the direct selling environment in japan continues to be difficult due to a general decline of the direct selling industry and regulatory and media scrutiny over the last several years 
as a result of this scrutiny  we continue to focus on distributor compliance and have also been cautious in both our corporate and our distributor marketing activities

on may   we issued a series of yen denominated senior promissory notes under the multi currency uncommitted shelf facility with an aggregate principal amount of billion yen 
on february   we entered into a second amendment of the amended and restated credit agreement 
the amendment increased the commitment amount from million to million from february to february  after which the commitment amount returns to the current level over a three month period 

table of contents our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase our outstanding shares of class a common stock on the open market or in private transactions 
the repurchases are used primarily to offset dilution from our equity incentive plans and for strategic initiatives 
during the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares of class a common stock under this program for million 
at december   million was available for repurchases under the stock repurchase program 
our board of directors declared cash dividends on our class a common stock of per share during each quarter of these quarterly cash dividends totaled approximately million and were paid during to stockholders of record in the board of directors has approved an increased quarterly cash dividend of per share of class a common stock to be paid on march   to stockholders of record on february  annually  this would increase the dividend to from in the prior year 
currently  we anticipate that our board of directors will continue to declare quarterly cash dividends and that the cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our future dividend payments 
however  the continued declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors  including our net earnings  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
as of december  and  we held million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents  including million and million  respectively  held in our operations outside of the us substantially all of our us cash and cash equivalents are readily convertible into us dollars or other currencies 
we typically fund the cash requirements of our operations in the us through intercompany charges for products  license fees and corporate services 
we currently plan to repatriate undistributed earnings from our foreign operations as necessary  considering the cash needs of our foreign operations and the cash needs of our us operations for dividends  stock repurchases  capital investments  debt repayment and strategic transactions 
in all but one jurisdiction  we have not designated our investments as permanently reinvested  but rather have these funds available for the our operations in the us as needed 
any repatriation of non us earnings requires payment of non us taxes in accordance with applicable us tax rules and regulations 
accordingly  we have accrued the necessary us taxes related to the funds that are not permanently reinvested 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to be able to meet our obligations on both a short term and long term basis 
we currently believe that existing cash balances  future cash flows from operations and existing lines of credit will be adequate to fund our cash needs on both a short and long term basis 
the majority of our historical expenses have been variable in nature and as such  a potential reduction in the level of revenue would reduce our cash flow needs 
in the event that our current cash balances  future cash flow from operations and current lines of credit are not sufficient to meet our obligations or strategic needs  we would consider raising additional funds in the debt or equity markets or restructuring our current debt obligations 
additionally  we would consider realigning our strategic plans  including a reduction in capital spending  stock repurchases or dividend payments 

table of contents contractual obligations and contingencies the following table sets forth payments due by period for fixed contractual obligations as of december  us dollars in thousands total thereafter long term debt obligations interest payable operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total the amounts reported under purchase obligations do not include anticipated expenditures related to ongoing construction projects at our corporate headquarters in provo  utah and our greater china regional headquarters in shanghai  china 
we currently anticipate the provo and shanghai facilities will require future expenditures of approximately million and million  respectively  and anticipate that both facilities will be substantially completed in other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet primarily consist of long term tax related balances  in which the timing of the commitments is uncertain 
we are currently involved in a dispute with customs authorities in japan with respect to duty assessments on several of our pharmanex nutritional products  which is separate and distinct from the dispute discussed above under gross profit 
the dispute relates to additional customs assessments made by yokohama customs for the period of october through september in connection with post importation audits  as well as the disputed portion of our import duties from october to the present  which we have or will hold in bond or pay under protest 
the aggregate amount of these assessments and disputed duties was billion japanese yen as of december  approximately million  net of any recovery of consumption taxes 
additional assessments related to any prior period would be barred by applicable statutes of limitations 
the issue in this case is whether a united states entity utilizing a commissionaire agent in japan to import its products can use the manufacturer invoice or must use another valuation method  and  if an alternative method must be used  what the allowable deductions would be in determining the proper valuation 
following our review of the assessments and after consulting with our legal and customs advisors  we believe that the additional assessments are improper and are not supported by applicable customs laws 
we filed letters of protest with yokohama customs  which were rejected 
we then appealed the matter to the ministry of finance in japan 
in may  we received notice that the ministry of finance in japan denied our administrative appeal 
we disagree with the ministry of finance administrative decision 
we are now pursuing the matter in tokyo district court  which we believe will provide a more independent determination of the matter 
in addition  we are currently being required to post a bond or make a deposit equal to the difference between our declared duties and the amount the customs authorities have determined we should be paying on all current imports 
because we believe that the higher rate determined by the customs authorities is an improper application of the regulations  we are currently expensing the portion of the duties we believe is supported under applicable customs law  and recording the additional deposit or payment as a receivable within long term assets on our consolidated financial statements 
if we are unsuccessful in recovering the amounts assessed and paid  we will likely record a non cash expense for the full amount of the disputed assessments 
we anticipate that additional disputed duties will be reduced going forward as we recently began purchasing a majority of the affected products in japan from a japanese company that purchases and imports the products from the manufacturer 

table of contents seasonality and cyclicality in addition to general economic factors  we are impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and vacation patterns 
for example  most asian markets celebrate their respective local new year in the first quarter  which generally has a negative impact on that quarter 
we believe that direct selling in japan  the united states and europe is also generally negatively impacted during the third quarter  when many individuals  including our distributors  traditionally take vacations 
we have experienced rapid revenue growth in certain new markets following commencement of operations 
this initial rapid growth has often been followed by a short period of stable or declining revenue  then followed by renewed growth fueled by product introductions  an increase in the number of actives and increased distributor productivity 
the contraction following initial rapid growth has been more pronounced in certain new markets  due to other factors such as business or economic conditions or distributor distractions outside the market 
although our product launch process may vary by market  we generally introduce new products to our distributors and consumers in all markets where the products are registered  through limited time offers in connection with global and regional distributor events 
the limited time offers typically generate significant distributor activity and a high level of purchasing  which may result in a higher than normal increase in revenue during the quarter of the limited time offer and skew year over year and sequential comparisons 
distributor information the following table provides information concerning the number of actives and sales leaders as of the dates indicated 
actives are persons who have purchased products directly from the company during the three months ended as of the date indicated 
sales leaders are persons who have completed and who maintain specified sales requirements 
sales leaders include our independent distributors who have completed and who maintain specified sales requirements  and our sales employees and contractual sales promoters in china  who have completed certain qualification requirements 
as of december  as of december  as of december  actives sales leaders actives sales leaders actives sales leaders north asia greater china south asia pacific americas emea total 
table of contents quarterly results the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly data for the periods shown us dollars in millions  except per share amounts st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter revenue gross profit operating income net income net income per share basic diluted recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the standard gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired rather than calculating the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset 
it is effective prospectively for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect to apply the qualitative assessment provisions of asu in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this pronouncement was issued to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments in this update seek to attain that objective by requiring an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to a balance sheet account ie inventory instead of directly to income or expense in the same reporting period 
this pronouncement is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not anticipate the adoption of asu to have a material impact to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
currency risk and exchange rate information a majority of our revenue and many of our expenses are recognized outside of the united states  except for inventory purchases  which are primarily transacted in us dollars from vendors in the united states 
the local currency of each of our subsidiaries primary markets is considered the functional currency 
all revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the periods reported 
therefore  our reported revenue and earnings will be positively impacted by a weakening of the us dollar and will be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the us dollar 
given the large portion of our business derived from japan  south korea and china  any weakening of these currencies negatively impacts reported revenue and profits  whereas a strengthening of these currencies positively impacts our reported revenue and profits 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  it is difficult to predict the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing and results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents foreign exchange risk is managed in certain jurisdictions through the use of foreign currency debt 
portions of our japanese yen borrowings have been designated  and are effective as  economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation 
accordingly  foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on these debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income 
included in the cumulative translation adjustment are million and million of pretax net losses and million of pretax net gains for the years ended december   and  respectively from japanese yen borrowings 
additionally  we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts and through intercompany loans of foreign currency 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our operating results 
at december  and  we held forward contracts designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling approximately million and million  respectively  to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions 
because of our foreign exchange contracts at december   the impact of a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against the japanese yen would not represent a material potential loss in fair value  earnings or cash flows against these contracts 
this potential loss does not consider the underlying foreign currency transaction or translation exposures to which we are subject 
following are the weighted average currency exchange rates of us into local currency for each of our international or foreign markets in which revenue exceeded us million for at least one of the quarters listed st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter japan taiwan hong kong south korea malaysia thailand china singapore canada as of january   the exchange rate of us into the japanese yen was approximately
