item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently supply a variety of suspension assemblies to all manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers for all sizes of disk drives 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives  and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of operations are affected from time to time by disk drive industry demand changes  adjustments in inventory levels throughout the disk drive supply chain  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market position and our customers market position  changes in supply chain alignment by a customer  our customers production yields and our own product transitions  production yields and production capacity utilization 
in recent years we have reshaped the company with the intent of being the industry s lowest cost producer of suspension assemblies 
while we have continued to realize net operating losses  we have lowered our overall cost structure by significantly improving our operating efficiency  transitioning more assembly production to our lower cost thailand operation and continued consolidation of our us operations 
we expect our business will generate profitability and positive cash flow as our volume grows over the long term 
we anticipated overall disk drive shipments would increase in  however  analysts estimates have shown little to no growth from calendar to despite the lack of disk drive market growth  we believe we improved our market share in our shipments of suspension assemblies increased from million in to million in as part of our continued focus on reducing our cost structure  we continue to look for cost reduction opportunities 
early in  we identified approximately positions to be eliminated in the us we are also further consolidating our manufacturing operations at our eau claire  wisconsin and hutchinson  minnesota sites 
we plan to vacate our assembly operations building in eau claire  wisconsin during by moving equipment to other available space and shifting more assembly production to our thailand operation 
the portion of our eau claire facility currently used for assembly operations is currently offered for sale or lease 
in hutchinson  we are consolidating our development center into our headquarters building  taking advantage of the space made available by moving component manufacturing from hutchinson to eau claire in  and the development center is currently offered for sale or lease 
in  we also plan to begin moving our stamping operation from a facility we currently lease in plymouth  minnesota to our headquarters building in hutchinson  minnesota 
we are continuing to pursue opportunities in applying our process technologies and manufacturing strengths to the production of precision components for applications outside the disk drive industry 
in   or of our revenues were from these activities compared to  or in in the early stages of this effort  the revenues generated have been somewhat unpredictable quarter to quarter 
we continue to explore a range of opportunities 
we are continuing to carefully manage our cost structure and cash position to ensure that we will meet our debt obligations while preserving the ability to make investments that will enable us to respond to customer requirements and achieve profitability 
early in  we issued  of notes due in and used the proceeds to repurchase  of our convertible notes 
this reduced our outstanding debt with a first put date in from  to  combined with the redemption of the remaining  of our convertible subordinated notes due the notes  the total principal amount of our outstanding long term debt was reduced from  at to  at see liquidity and capital resources section below for a full discussion of our cash position and debt 
despite being a challenging year  we are pleased with our competitive position at fiscal year end 
we are meeting our customers advancing requirements through strong alignment with their roadmaps and solid product performance 
our relationship and position with western digital continues to be very strong  and our business with seagate has grown 
we have a competitive cost structure that will improve further as we transition more assembly production to thailand and continue to consolidate our us operations 
we believe our execution will improve in and  as it does  we will realize greater benefits from our restructuring efforts 
effective october   we realigned our business into a single operating and reportable segment 
our chief operating decision maker now assesses financial performance of our company as a whole 
due primarily to the restructuring actions that occurred during and the additional cost reductions that we have made since the end of  the operating losses from our biomeasurement products have been significantly reduced 
in connection with this realignment  we have also eliminated divisional presidents 
we are continuing to look at partnering opportunities with medical industry companies that can help us get market traction and extract value from the biomeasurement technology that we have developed 
general business the following table sets forth our quarterly suspension assembly shipment quantities in millions for the periods indicated by quarter by quarter first second third fourth first second third fourth suspension assembly shipment quantities the october flooding in thailand temporarily constrained the overall production capacity of the hard disk drive supply chain in additionally  some hard disk drive manufacturers temporarily reduced the average capacity size of their disk drives to maximize their use of components that were in short supply  and therefore  maximize the number of disk drives that they were able to ship 
we believe this temporarily reduced the number of suspensions per disk drive 
these factors together caused a material decrease in our suspension assembly demand 
our week fiscal fourth quarter of shipments totaled million  down on a weekly shipment basis compared with the week fiscal third quarter of in  our suspension assembly shipments benefited from our market share positions on both existing and new customer programs even as the worldwide disk drive and suspension assembly demand remained soft 
we believe we ended with market share at approximately which is up from at the end of our average selling price has fluctuated from quarter to quarter but the annual average has remained flat at in  and however  in  we have seen a product mix shift with an increase in shipments of higher priced dsa suspensions  offset by the mix of lower priced single stage suspension assemblies 
dsa suspensions  which carry a higher selling price and cost more to manufacture  increased to of our product mix compared to in we expect dsa suspensions to account for approximately of our shipments in the first quarter of and to grow to about half of our shipments by the end of our gross profits have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors  key among them being changes in demand for our suspension assemblies 
our customers often prefer a multiple source supply strategy and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand 
certain agreements with our customers also provide that we maintain minimum finished goods inventory levels for them 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross profits and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
although we experienced some short term manufacturing issues in the last half of which resulted in approximately  of additional expenses  gross profit for was  compared to  for  an increase of  overall  gross profit benefited from lower variable costs  resulting primarily from improved efficiency in manufacturing tsa suspension assemblies compared to  and from our cost reduction actions 
we also realized an improvement of approximately  due to increased shipments of higher priced development products and increased scrap recoveries 
these improvements were partially offset by approximately  and  of incremental costs of manufacturing in our us assembly operations instead of in thailand  for and  respectively 
we also recorded a  impairment of our biomeasurement inventory late in we have corrected the manufacturing issues and they had no impact on our ability to meet customers requirements  and we expect our operational and financial performance will continue to improve in early in  severe flooding in thailand required us to suspend our assembly operations at our thailand manufacturing facility 
by the end of  we had resumed production at our thailand manufacturing facility 
in  we ramped production in thailand to take advantage of our lower costs there and to satisfy our customers desires to have more of their suspensions manufactured there 
we exited with approximately half of our fourth quarter total assembly production coming from thailand 
however  our fourth quarter of assembly yields and manufacturing efficiency fell short of our targets 
in addition  our thailand operation continues to produce a significantly larger percentage of our dsa suspensions 
the combination of these put pressure on our yields and efficiencies 
to improve our operating performance  we are providing additional technical and manufacturing support to our thailand operation 
this additional support is helping reinforce and bolster the process know how and proficiency required to achieve our goals 
in the first quarter of  the yields at our thailand operation have begun to improve  and we expect that the improvements will continue 
we expect to of our assembly production to come from our thailand operations in our first quarter of we remain committed to transitioning more assembly production to thailand to realize the significant cost advantages that operation provides 
we expect gross profit to improve in as our shipment volume increases and as we continue to ramp our thailand assembly operations 
improvement in our gross profits and operating profits will depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure and our suspension assembly production capacity 
our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs 
our profits are sensitive to our level of fixed costs  as well as changes in volume  capacity utilization and product mix 
in the future  we may need to adjust our overall employment level due to fluctuating demand 
our overall employment level was  at the end of   at the end of  and  at the end of the increase in employment from to was due to ramping our assembly manufacturing operation in thailand partially offset by continued consolidation of our us manufacturing operations 
market trends our suspension assemblies are components in hard disk drives used in computers and a variety of consumer electronics and enterprise storage products 
we believe that the continued growth of digital content world wide requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store  aggregate  host  distribute  manage and backup content  which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drives 
non compute applications  such as internet based storage of consumer data  smartphones  digital video recorders dvrs and gaming devices are driving the broad  global growth of digital content through creation and sharing of all types of digital content  such as high resolution photos  high definition video and movies  and music by consumers and data by enterprises  collection and distribution of digital content through services and other company offerings such as youtube  llc by google  inc  network infrastructure  including broadband  cable and satellite  which is enabling the access  hosting and distribution of digital content  consumption of digital content through handheld devices such as smartphones  dvrs and gaming consoles  and protection of content through storage backup devices and services 
the demand for disk drives and  therefore  suspension assemblies can be volatile  as experienced since calendar  due to market and world economic conditions 
in a weak economy  consumer and business spending tends to decline and demand for computer systems and other consumer electronics and enterprise storage products tends to decrease 
demand for suspension assemblies  therefore  may be adversely impacted as a result of a weaker economy 
in the long term  however  we expect that the growth in digital content and the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  desktop and mobile computers  increasingly complex software as well as the data intensive non compute market will increase demand for disk drives and  therefore  suspension assemblies 
while the overall demand for disk drive storage remains strong  the components making up that demand are changing 
demand for higher capacity cloud storage applications is offsetting declines in drive demand associated with lower spending for desktop and portable computers 
meeting the growing demand for data storage is expected to require more data surfaces and  in turn  more suspension assemblies 
the hard disk drive market segments with the strongest growth rates personal storage and capacity optimized enterprise storage for cloud computing use more suspension assemblies per disk drive 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes and unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models and the end devices in which disk drives are used 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the primary storage device of choice for applications requiring shorter access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per unit of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs is leading to suspension assemblies with flexures that have finer electrical conductors  greater lead counts and increased complexity such as interleaved or stacked traces or dsa suspension designs  and to the adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies  such as formed and polished headlifts  larger dampers with through hole features  co located micro actuation and a variety of limiter configurations 
the development of next generation read write technology and the introduction of new types or configurations of read write head configurations and sizes  and the continuing improvement in data density and the use of disk drives in consumer electronics and enterprise storage applications will require even finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
next generation disk drives also will likely require additional electrical conductors 
these changes may temporarily increase our development spending and reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
we are investing in developing the process capabilities and related capital equipment required to meet new industry specifications in and beyond 
the advent of new disk drive technologies may initially decrease our customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
in addition  disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is highly competitive 
while we are generally able to increase our selling price for suspension assemblies when they are introduced  our selling prices decrease as our products mature 
the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for each period presented

operations to operations net sales for were  compared to  for  an increase of  suspension assembly sales increased  primarily as a result of a increase in suspension assembly unit shipments 
our average selling price remained at in both and we believe the increase in unit shipments was primarily a result of an increase in our market share 
suspension assembly component sales were  in compared to  in  primarily as a result of the flood related capacity constraints in the disk drive industry creating demand for our suspension assembly components in gross profit for was  compared to  for  an increase of  gross profit was of net sales in  compared to in although we experienced some short term manufacturing issues in the last half of that resulted in approximately  of additional expenses  overall  gross profit benefited from lower variable costs  resulting primarily from improved efficiency in manufacturing tsa suspension assemblies compared to  and from our cost reduction actions

we also recorded a  impairment of our biomeasurement inventory late in research and development expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily related to lower labor expenses as a result of cost reductions 
research and development expenses were of net sales in and in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the lower selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to cost reduction actions 
in  we incurred  of site consolidation expenses  primarily internal labor  contractors and freight  related to the ongoing consolidation of our us operations 
during the first quarter of  we identified approximately positions to be eliminated as part of our continued focus on overall cost reduction 
this resulted in  of severance and other expenses for all severance and benefits amounts owed have been paid in full 
during the first quarter of  severance and other expenses were reduced  we reversed  of previously accrued severance and benefits expenses  partially offset by  of other expenses incurred related to our site consolidation plans 
as a result of leveraging our us assembly operations to offset the temporary loss of manufacturing capacity in thailand  we retained approximately employees in our hutchinson  minnesota manufacturing facility that we previously expected to terminate and whose anticipated severance and benefits were included in our severance and benefits expenses 
debt refinancing costs for were  because the terms of the secured notes issued march  in exchange for notes were not substantially different  debt modification accounting was applied in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance 
the debt refinancing costs associated with the debt transactions were expensed as incurred 
as a result of the flooding in thailand  during  we recorded  of insurance recoveries  net of flood related costs  which included  of flood insurance recoveries  partially offset by  of asset impairments  inventory write downs  and thailand operating and site restoration costs 
the gain on short and long term investments for was  compared to a gain of  for the gains in and were due to payments we received under a settlement agreement 
auction rate securities ars previously held by us were subsequently sold by the settlement parties at a price that was higher than the price identified in the settlement agreement 
other expense income for included a foreign currency loss of  compared to a foreign currency loss of  for these were primarily related to purchases and advances denominated in us dollars made by our thailand operation 
in march  we issued  aggregate principal amount of secured notes 
of that total amount   aggregate principal amount of secured notes were issued pursuant to an effective registration statement relating to an offer to purchase for cash or exchange for new securities any and all of our outstanding notes the tender exchange offer 
we made cash payments totaling  plus accrued and unpaid interest  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes that were tendered and accepted for purchase 
applying debt extinguishment accounting  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of  the consideration paid for outstanding notes tendered for purchase was funded by the proceeds from the secured notes sold by us in a private placement of these notes 
in april  we completed an offer to purchase for cash  aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes 
after funding the purchase of outstanding notes pursuant to the tender exchange offer  we applied  of residual proceeds from the private placement of secured notes to fund the purchase of outstanding convertible notes 
applying debt extinguishment accounting  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of  in january  we repurchased  aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes by making cash payments totaling  plus accrued and unpaid interest  which payments were funded by the proceeds of the sale of our notes 
applying debt extinguishment accounting  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of  in february  we redeemed the remaining  aggregate principal amount of our notes 
none of the notes remain outstanding 
operations to operations net sales for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  suspension assembly sales decreased  primarily as a result of a decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments 
our average selling price remained at in both and the decrease in unit shipments was primarily a result of the flood related capacity constraints at our customers thailand facilities 
suspension assembly component sales were  in  primarily as a result of the flood related capacity constraints in the disk drive industry creating demand for our suspension assembly components 
we had no suspension assembly component sales in gross profit for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  gross profit was of net sales in  compared to in the lower gross profit in was primarily the result of reduced sales  which reduced our ability to cover our fixed costs  as discussed above  partially offset by decreased spending as a result of our consolidation and restructuring plan 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for  an increase of  the increase was primarily related to higher labor expenses as a result of increased spending on tsa process and capacity improvements and new process technology research and development expenses were of net sales in and in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the lower selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to cost savings from our restructuring actions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as were of net sales in and in during the first quarter of  severance and other expenses were reduced  we reversed  of previously accrued severance and benefits expenses  partially offset by  of other expenses incurred related to our site consolidation plans 
as a result of leveraging our us assembly operations to offset the temporary loss of manufacturing capacity in thailand  we retained approximately employees in our hutchinson  minnesota manufacturing facility that we previously expected to terminate and whose anticipated severance and benefits were included in our severance and benefits expenses 
during the second quarter of  we announced a manufacturing consolidation and restructuring plan that included eliminating approximately positions from our us workforce 
the workforce reduction and manufacturing consolidation resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of  of which  was related to our biomeasurement area 
debt refinancing costs for were  because the terms of the secured notes issued march  in exchange for notes were not substantially different  debt modification accounting was applied in accordance with fasb guidance 
the debt refinancing costs associated with the debt transactions were expensed as incurred 
as a result of the flooding in thailand  during  we recorded  of insurance recoveries  net of flood related costs  which included  of flood insurance recoveries  partially offset by  of asset impairments  inventory write downs  and thailand operating and site restoration costs 
the gain on short and long term investments for was  compared to a gain of  for the gain in and was due to payments we received under a settlement agreement 
ars previously held by us were subsequently sold by the settlement parties at a price that was higher than the price identified in the settlement agreement 
in march  we issued  aggregate principal amount of secured notes 
we issued  aggregate principal amount of secured notes pursuant to an effective registration statement relating to the tender exchange offer 
we issued the remaining  aggregate principal amount of secured notes in a private placement that included the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price for the secured notes and warrants issued in the private placement was  in accordance with the terms of the tender exchange offer  we made cash payments totaling  plus accrued and unpaid interest  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of notes 
applying debt extinguishment accounting to the purchases  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of  we also issued  aggregate principal amount of secured notes  and made cash payments in lieu of partial notes and for accrued and unpaid interest  in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of notes 
because the terms of the secured notes and outstanding notes were not substantially different  debt modification accounting was applied in accordance with fasb guidance 
as a result  not gain or loss was recorded on the debt exchange 
in april  we purchased for cash  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes  which was partially funded by  of residual proceeds from the private placement of secured notes 
applying debt extinguishment accounting  we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of  in february  we retired an aggregate principal amount of  of the notes 
we made cash payments of  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of the notes and we issued  aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
in july  we completed another exchange  in which we issued  aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes and made aggregate cash payments of  in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
a total of  aggregate principal amount of the notes remained outstanding after completion of the july exchange 
we determined that the purchases and exchanges were a substantial debt modification and applied debt extinguishment accounting 
the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the liability component of our debt at the date of extinguishment was recorded as an  gain on extinguishment of debt 
the difference between the fair value of the liability component and the fair value of the consideration exchanged was applied as reacquisition of the equity component  which resulted in a  reduction to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations  our revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank  and additional financing capacity  if available given current credit market conditions and our operating performance 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased from  at september   to  at september  our short term investments remained at  in total  our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by  this decrease was primarily due to  for planned capital expenditures   used to redeem all our remaining notes  and  used to repurchase outstanding convertible notes 
the decreases were partially offset by  in proceeds from the private placement of notes   of cash provided by operations   in proceeds from equipment sale leaseback transactions   in borrowings outstanding at year end under the senior secured credit facility  and the release of  of restricted cash that was temporarily held in our senior secured credit facility collections account 
although net sales increased slightly in  our net sales have decreased significantly in recent years 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations  our credit facility and additional financing  if needed and as available given contractual restrictions  current credit market conditions and our operating performance  will be sufficient to meet our forecasted operating expenses  debt service requirements  and capital expenditures through we currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes   aggregate principal amount of our secured notes and  aggregate principal amount of our notes 
holders of our convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash as early as january  our secured notes and our notes mature on january  during the fiscal year all  aggregate principal amount of notes were redeemed 
due to the flooding in thailand in october  we spent approximately  during and approximately  during for incremental costs of manufacturing in our us assembly operations instead of in thailand  capital expenditures for site restoration and equipment replacement  inventory replenishment  and recovery expenses at our thailand facility 
these costs do not include lost profits 
these expenditures were partially offset by the  in insurance proceeds that we received in our thailand flood insurance policy in effect at the time of the october thailand flood had a one year term and has expired 
we have evaluated flood related insurance available to us  assessing our current flood risk compared to the cost of flood insurance 
our current flood coverage under a thailand government program is approximately  in addition to our current insurance coverage for flooding for our thailand facility of approximately  we may from time to time seek to prepay or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these transactions  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results  contractual restrictions and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional financing on terms acceptable to us  including covenants that we will be able to comply with in the short term  or at all  if needed 
if we are unable to obtain new financing  if and when necessary  our future financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
senior secured credit facility in september  we entered into a revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank 
the credit agreement provides us with a senior secured credit facility in a principal amount of up to  subject to a borrowing base 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the personal and real property of hutchinson technology incorporated 
the maturity date of the credit facility is october  the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and minimum liquidity 
we maintain an account at pnc bank with a minimum balance of  as required under the credit agreement 
our credit agreement with pnc bank and the indentures governing the secured notes  each contain certain covenants that  among other things  limit our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries  enter into transactions with affiliates  create or incur liens  enter into operating leases  merge  consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets  make capital expenditures  change the nature of our business  and expend the assets or free cash flow of certain subsidiaries 
the indenture also limits the amount of our consolidated total assets and free cash flow that can be attributable to subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the secured notes or  in certain cases  have not pledged their stock to secure the secured notes 
as of january   we entered into a consent and third amendment to our credit agreement with pnc bank 
under the consent and amendment  pnc bank consented to the january debt transactions  including the private placement and the repurchases  and the granting of the liens to secure the notes 
on october   subsequent to the end of our fiscal  we entered into a waiver and fourth amendment to our credit agreement with pnc bank 
the amendment modifies the financial covenants  as previously amended  to eliminate the compliance requirement for our fourth quarter ended september  and change the measurement periods and adjust the financial covenants starting with our fiscal first quarter ending december  by excluding from such measurement periods all fiscal quarters ended on or prior to september  with this waiver and amendment in place  we were in compliance with the terms  provisions and financial covenants of our revolving credit and security agreement as of september  from time to time  we borrow funds under the senior secured credit facility to maintain certain levels of cash at quarter end 
our largest borrowing in was  and was repaid early in the following quarter 
as of september   we had  in outstanding borrowings 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the amount was repaid 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear cash interest at a reduced rate equal to  at our election  either i pnc bank s alternate base rate plus per annum  or ii libor plus per annum if no defaults or events of default exist under the credit agreement 
if we are unable to generate sufficient operating results in future quarters  we may be out of compliance with financial covenants in the credit agreement in future quarters 
if necessary  we intend to negotiate a waiver of any noncompliance or an amendment of the financial covenant specific to the applicable period 
notes redemption on january   we initiated a redemption of all remaining outstanding notes 
in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes and a notice of redemption thereunder  all  aggregate principal amount of notes were redeemed on or before february  at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest up to  but not including  the redemption date 
interest on the notes called for redemption ceased to accrue as of february  payment of the redemption price was funded by cash on hand 
after completion of the redemption  no notes remained outstanding 
debt transactions on january   we sold  aggregate principal amount of notes for a total purchase price of  on the same date  we repurchased  aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes by making cash payments totaling  plus accrued and unpaid interest  which payments were funded by the proceeds of the sale of the notes 
this refinancing reduced the portion of our outstanding debt subject to a holder initiated repurchase as early as from  to  the notes were issued under an indenture dated as of january   and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semiannually in arrears on january and july of each year  beginning july  the notes are secured by liens on all assets securing our senior secured credit facilities other than capital stock of subsidiaries of our company to the extent that inclusion of such capital stock would require the filing of separate financial statements for such subsidiaries with the sec  which liens rank junior in priority to the liens securing our senior secured credit facilities and other permitted priority liens and on an equal and ratable basis with the liens securing our secured notes 
the notes are scheduled to mature on january  unless redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time by paying of the principal amount redeemed  plus a make whole premium on the principal amount redeemed as of  and accrued and unpaid interest to  the date of redemption 
the indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries  enter into transactions with affiliates  create or incur liens and enter into operating leases 
the indenture also limits the amount of our consolidated total assets and free cash flow that can be attributable to subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the notes or  in certain cases  had their stock pledged to secure the notes 
the indenture contains customary events of default  the occurrence of which would permit the acceleration of the notes  including failure to pay principal of or interest on the notes  failure to comply with covenants in the indenture or other related documents  default in the payment of principal of  or acceleration of  other material indebtedness for borrowed money of the company  failure of the company or any of its significant subsidiaries to pay or discharge material judgments  and bankruptcy of the company or any of its significant subsidiaries 
to accommodate the january debt transactions described above  on january   we entered into i a first supplemental indenture to the indenture dated as of march   which governs the secured notes  and ii a consent and third amendment to our revolving credit and security agreement 
capital leases in  we entered into leasing agreements to lease manufacturing equipment in thailand 
as of september   we had received  of cash in sale leaseback transactions and had remaining lease payment obligations of  the present value of the minimum quarterly payments under these capital leases resulted in an initial  of related leased assets 
capital expenditures our suspension assembly business is capital intensive 
the disk drive industry experiences rapid technology changes that require us to make substantial ongoing capital expenditures in product and process improvements to maintain our competitiveness 
significant industry technology transitions often result in increasing our capital expenditures 
the disk drive industry also experiences periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction  which also results in fluctuations in our capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  for   for and  for capital expenditures for were primarily for manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  new program tooling  and thailand recovery 
capital expenditures for were primarily for new program tooling  new process technology and capability improvements  and thailand recovery 
capital expenditures for were primarily for manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  new program tooling and thailand assembly related equipment 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures to be  to  in  primarily for manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  such as dsa suspension assemblies  and product tooling 
financing of these capital expenditures will be principally from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  our revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank or additional financing  if available given current credit market conditions 
our capital expenditures are planned based on process improvements to be incorporated in our manufacturing operations and the rate at which our customers adopt new generations of higher performance disk drives and next generation read write technology and head sizes  which may require new or improved process technologies  such as additive processing to produce flexures for our tsa suspensions or dsa suspensions  anticipated customer demand for our suspension assembly products and market demand for disk drives 
capital spending is also based on our ability to finance capital expenditures  as discussed above 
we manage our capital spending to reflect the capacity that we expect will be needed to meet disk drive industry customer forecasts 
however  existing work in process with vendors and lengthy lead times sometimes prevent us from adjusting our capital expenditures to match near term demand 
this can result in underutilization of capacity  which could lower gross profit 
share repurchase program in  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to spend up to  to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of september   we had spent  to repurchase  shares at an average price of and no repurchase had been made since 
the board of directors terminated the plan on october  contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations at september  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total debt credit facility interest expense capital leases operating leases total as of september   the liability balance for uncertain tax positions was  we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
we currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes 
holders of our convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash as early as january  the outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our secured notes matures on january  we also currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our notes that matures on january  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact on the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs associated with products sold are classified as revenue 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the product has been delivered to the customer s premises 
we also store inventory in vendor managed inventory  or vmi facilities  which are warehouses located close to the customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from such facilities upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that provide us with reimbursement for engineering services and specific program capacity to partially offset the costs of our investment 
we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated life of the program to which the services and capacity relate 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
during the second quarter of  we announced a manufacturing consolidation and restructuring plan that consolidated our hutchinson  minnesota components operations into our operations in eau claire  wisconsin 
we believe the consolidation and restructuring plan  together with our continued operating losses  were a triggering event that required an impairment analysis 
our impairment analysis for the second quarter of indicated that no charge for impairment was required 
based on our forecast model  there was in excess of between our expected undiscounted cash flows and the carrying value of our assets 
during the first quarter of  flooding in thailand required us to suspend our thailand assembly operations and constrained the disk drive manufacturing supply chain  which affected demand for our products 
we believe that the flooding  together with our continued operating losses  was a triggering event that required an impairment analysis 
based on our forecast model and impairment analysis for our first quarter of  there was in excess of between our expected undiscounted cash flows and the carrying value of our assets 
however  impairments were recognized on specifically identified assets that were destroyed by the flooding 
late in december  we decided to further consolidate and streamline our us operations 
in connection with this consolidation of our operations  we have initiated the marketing of two of our facilities for sale or lease  including the portion of our eau claire  wisconsin facility used for assembly operations and the development center building on our hutchinson  minnesota campus 
we believe that the decision to consolidate operations was a triggering event that required an impairment analysis to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets 
our impairment analysis in the first quarter of indicated that no charge for impairment was required 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances arise due to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets 
at september   and september   we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
the fasb guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under the guidance  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that a full valuation allowance is appropriate 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risk on our debt obligations that are subject to fixed interest rates 
interest rate changes  however  would affect the fair market value of this fixed rate debt 
at september   we had fixed rate debt of  with a fair market value of  we used trading activity to determine the fair market value of the notes and convertible notes 
the senior notes had not experienced significant trading activity  therefore the estimate was based on the closing market price of similar debt as of the end of the fiscal year 
as of september  we had  outstanding under our credit facility with pnc bank 
prior to march   amounts borrowed under the credit facility were subject to cash interest  at our election  at a rate equal to either i pnc bank s alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus per annum  or ii libor plus per annum 
after march   such loans  if any  are eligible to bear cash interest at a reduced rate equal to either i pnc bank s alternate base rate plus per annum  or ii libor plus per annum if no defaults or events of default exist under the credit agreement
