item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources for the periods described 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item of this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements for the risks  uncertainties and assumptions associated with these forward looking statements 
during the year ended december   the company changed its method of accounting to present shipping and handling costs related to the sale of the company s products together with the cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
these shipping and handling costs have previously been presented by the company as part of selling  general and administrative expenses 
this change has been made retrospectively to all periods presented in the company s financial statements 
in connection with the change in presentation  the company also changed its definition of shipping and handling costs to include expenses of the company s distribution facilities to prepare products for shipment 
previously  the company defined shipping and handling costs as costs incurred for a third party shipper to transport products to the customer 
this presentation is preferable as it better matches all the costs directly associated with generating revenue and therefore better presents gross margin  and this financial statement presentation will be more comparable to the company s peer group 
the only impact on the company s financial statements was to increase cost of sales and decrease selling  general  and administrative in the consolidated statement of operations 
the impact of this change in accounting principle was to increase cost of sales and decrease selling  general and administrative expenses by million for the year ended december  the impact of this change in accounting principle on cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses for the four years ended december  was million  million  million and million  respectively 
the following discussion  including statements relating to the results of operations in fiscal years and  reflect the change in accounting principle of our consolidated financial statement for prior years as noted above 

table of contents overview our business  industry and target market nature s sunshine products  inc  together with its subsidiaries  is a natural health and wellness company primarily engaged in the manufacturing and direct selling of nutritional and personal care products 
the company is a utah corporation with its principal place of business in lehi  utah  and sells its products to a sales force of independent managers and distributors who use the products themselves or resell them to other distributors or customers 
the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  distribution and sale of each of our major product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies 
the company has three business segments that are divided based on the different characteristics of their distributor bases  marketing and distributor compensation plans and product formulations  as well as the internal organization of our officers and their responsibilities and business operations 
two business segments operate under the nature s sunshine products brand nsp americas  asia pacific and europe and nsp russia  central and eastern europe  and one operates under the synergy worldwide brand 
we market our products in australia  austria  belarus  canada  colombia  costa rica  the czech republic  denmark  the dominican republic  ecuador  el salvador  finland  germany  guatemala  honduras  hong kong  indonesia  ireland  japan  kazakhstan  latvia  lithuania  malaysia  mexico  moldova  mongolia  the netherlands  nicaragua  norway  panama  peru  the philippines  poland  russia  singapore  south korea  spain  sweden  taiwan  thailand  the ukraine  the united kingdom  the united states  venezuela and vietnam 
we export our products to several other countries  including argentina  australia  chile  israel  new zealand and norway 
in  we experienced a decrease in our consolidated net sales of percent 
synergy worldwide net sales increased approximately percent compared to the same period in or percent in local currencies excluding the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
nsp americas  asia pacific and europe net sales decreased approximately percent compared to the same period in or a decrease in local currency net sales of percent excluding the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
nsp russia  central and eastern europe net sales increased approximately percent compared to the same period in our most significant sales revenue growth was from our synergy businesses in europe and korea during gains in these markets were partially offset  principally by decreases in our nsp mexico  nsp and synergy japan  nsp peru and synergy north american markets 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales revenue for decreased to percent from percent in the prior year 
primarily as a result of the reduction of our royalty costs related to our russian business as described below  and our successful efforts to reduce operating costs in all of our operating segments 
primarily as a result of reductions of our royalty costs related to our russian business and onetime contract termination costs of million related to the nutriplus settlement in  our consolidated operating income for increased to percent of net sales revenue from percent in the prior year 
we distribute our products to consumers through an independent sales force comprised of independent managers and distributors 
typically a person who joins our independent sales force begins as a distributor 
a distributor interested in earning additional income by committing more time and effort to selling our products may earn manager status  which is contingent upon attaining certain purchase levels  recruiting additional distributors and demonstrating leadership abilities 
on a worldwide basis  active managers were approximately  and  and active distributors and customers were approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that the number of distributors and customers will increase if our existing business grows and we enter new international markets  and if current managers and distributors expand their networks and grow their businesses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and form the basis for the following discussion and analysis on critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates and those differences could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the board of directors and its audit committee 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we believe the critical accounting policies and estimates described below reflect our more significant 
table of contents estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact and any associated risks on our business that are related to these policies are also discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition net sales revenue and related volume incentive expenses are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collectability is reasonably assured  the amount is fixed and determinable  and title and risk of loss have passed  generally  when the merchandise has been delivered 
the amount of the volume incentive is determined based upon the amount of qualifying purchases in a given month 
it is necessary for us to make estimates about the timing of when merchandise has been delivered 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience related to time in transit  timing of when shipments occurred and shipping volumes 
amounts received for undelivered merchandise are recorded as deferred revenue 
from time to time  our us operations extend short term credit associated with product promotions 
in addition  for certain of our international operations  we offer credit terms consistent with industry standards within the country of operation 
payments to managers and distributors for sales incentives or rebates related to individual purchases are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
payments for sales incentives and rebates are calculated monthly based upon qualifying sales 
membership fees are deferred and amortized as revenue over the life of the membership  primarily one year 
prepaid event registration fees are deferred and recognized as revenues when the related event is held 
a reserve for product returns is recorded based upon historical experience 
we allow managers or distributors to return the unused portion of products within days of purchase if they are not satisfied with the product 
in some of our markets  the requirements to return product are more restrictive 
sales returns for the years  and  were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
this estimated allowance is based primarily on the aging category  historical trends and management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customer 
this reserve is adjusted periodically as information about specific accounts becomes available 
investments our available for sale investment portfolio is recorded at fair value and consists of various securities such as state and municipal obligations  us government security funds  short term deposits and various equity securities 
these investments are valued using a quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or b from significant inputs that are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset 
our trading portfolio is recorded at fair value and consists of various marketable securities that are valued using quoted prices in active markets 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  we perform an analysis to assess whether it intends to sell or whether it would be more likely than not required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  and the full amount of the unrealized loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
for all other debt securities that experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary and not related to credit loss  we record a loss  net of any tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the credit loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss when sold 
management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment s fair value is other than temporary 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security 
for equity securities  when assessing whether a decline in fair value below our cost basis is other than temporary  we consider the fair market value of the security  the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
where we have determined that we lack the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the components of inventory cost include raw materials  labor and overhead 
to estimate any necessary obsolescence or lower of cost or market adjustments  
table of contents various assumptions are made in regard to excess or slow moving inventories  non conforming inventories  expiration dates  current and future product demand  production planning and market conditions 
self insurance liabilities similar to other manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of our products results in injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
we have historically had a very limited number of product claims or reports from individuals who have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our products 
these matters have historically been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments 
we have established a wholly owned captive insurance company to provide us with product liability insurance coverage  and have accrued a reserve that we believe is sufficient to cover probable and reasonable estimable liabilities related to product liability claims based upon our history 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be sufficient  nor can there be any assurance that the ultimate outcome of any litigation for product liability will not have a material negative impact on our business prospects  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we self insure for certain employee medical benefits 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods  and are not discounted 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims and claims incurred but not reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in actual liabilities being more or less than the amounts currently recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows of the related assets or groups of assets over their remaining lives in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
an impairment loss is calculated by determining the difference between the carrying values and the fair values of these assets 
we did not consider any of our long lived assets to be impaired during the years ended december   or incentive trip accrual we accrue for expenses associated with our direct sales marketing program  which rewards independent managers and distributors with paid attendance for incentive trips  including company conventions and meetings 
expenses associated with incentive trips are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned 
we specifically analyze incentive trip accruals based on historical and current sales trends as well as contractual obligations when evaluating the adequacy of the incentive trip accrual 
actual results could generate liabilities more or less than the amounts recorded 
we have accrued incentive trip costs of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
contingencies we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
when a loss is considered probable in connection with litigation or non income tax contingencies and when such loss can be reasonably estimated with a range  we record our best estimate within the range related to the contingency 
if there is no best estimate  we record the minimum of the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise the estimates 
revision in estimates of the potential liabilities could materially affect our results of operations in the period of adjustment 
our contingencies are discussed in further detail in note  commitment and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in item  part of this report 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and contingent reserves reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the company s consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
valuation allowances are recorded as reserves against net deferred tax assets by the company when it is determined that net deferred tax assets are not likely to be 
table of contents realized in the foreseeable future 
as of december  and  we had recorded valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  as offsets to our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of million  which will expire at various dates from through the company had approximately million of foreign tax credits  most of which expire in changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
share based compensation we recognize all share based payments to directors and employees  including grants of stock options and restricted stock units  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their grant date fair values 
we record compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the vesting period of the stock options based on the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant 
we estimated forfeiture rate is based upon historical experience 
presentation net sales revenue represents net sales including shipping and handling revenues offset by volume rebates given to managers  distributors and customers 
volume rebates as a percentage of retail sales may vary by country depending upon regulatory restrictions that limit or otherwise restrict rebates 
we also offer reduced volume rebates with respect to certain products and promotions worldwide 
our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total net sales 
as a result  total net sales will continue to be affected by fluctuations in the us dollar against foreign currencies 
in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  in addition to comparing the percent change in net sales from one period to another in us dollars  we also compare the percent change in net sales from one period to another period by excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange as shown below 
net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations is not a us gaap financial measure 
net sales in local currency removes from net sales in us dollars the impact of changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries  by translating the current period net sales into us dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the net sales for the previous comparable period 
we believe presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of our foreign operations from period to period 
however  net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in us dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates  or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
our gross profit consists of net sales less cost of sales  which represents our manufacturing costs  the price we pay to our raw material suppliers and manufacturers of our products and duties and tariffs as well as shipping and handling costs related to product shipments 
volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program  and represent commission payments made to our independent managers and distributors 
these payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels and for recruiting additional distributors 
volume incentives vary slightly  on a percentage basis  by product due to our pricing policies and commission plans in place in our various operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent our operating expenses  components of which include labor and benefits  sales events  professional fees  travel and entertainment  distributor marketing  occupancy costs  communication costs  bank fees  depreciation and amortization  and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
most of our sales to distributors outside the united states are made in the respective local currencies 
in preparing our financial statements  we translate revenues into us dollars using average exchange rates 
additionally  the majority of our purchases from our suppliers generally are made in us dollars 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar versus a foreign currency can have a negative impact on our reported sales and contribution margins and can generate transaction losses on intercompany transactions 
throughout the last five years  foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated significantly

we experienced a million unfavorable impact in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation in  and our consolidated net sales revenue would have increased slightly from but for such negative impact

in japan  net sales revenues decreased approximately million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in fluctuations in foreign exchange rates had a nominally unfavorable impact on net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales is partially due to the challenging japanese direct selling market 
in addition  unusually high product returns during the first quarter of related to a specific promotion that contributed significantly to reduced net sales revenue for the year 
product returns were not related to product quality and have since returned to normal low return rates 
net sales have stabilized and maintained a consistent level since may in north america  net sales revenues decreased approximately million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the lack of recruiting  retention and training efforts has been the primary driver for this decrease 
upcoming growth initiatives are being modeled to effectively spark further recruiting  retention and training activity 
further information related to our business segments is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of net sales revenue increased to percent in  compared to percent in these increases are primarily due to increased raw material costs  product and material write offs  changes in product mix between markets and increased importation fees related to higher transfer prices within some of our markets 
while the company intends to seek continued cost reductions where possible  pricing pressure on raw materials  fuel costs and other factors could adversely affect our ability to reduce or maintain our current cost of sales rate in the future 
volume incentives volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program  and represent commission payments made to our independent managers and distributors 
these payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher product sales levels and for recruiting additional distributors

of the million  the company applied million toward previously accrued and expensed but unpaid royalties  and million in exchange for the contract termination and extinguishment of future royalty obligations 
due to the nutriplus settlement in  we eliminated an estimated million in annual royalty costs in income taxes our effective income tax rate was percent for  compared to percent for the effective rate for differed from the federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the following i adjustments to valuation allowances decreased the effective rate by percent in included were adjustments for the removal of domestic valuation allowances on foreign tax credits  as well as the effect of valuation allowances of foreign deferred tax assets 
ii the impact of a decrease in the blended state rate between and led to a percent increase to the effective rate in a decrease in the blended state rate causes a permanent difference relating to the state deferred tax assets 
iii foreign tax rate differentials that incrementally affect the federal statutory rate decreased the effective tax rate by approximately percent in this is primarily due to differences between the lower statutory rates in foreign entities compared to the us statutory rate of percent 
as a net result of these and other differences  the effective tax rate for was less than the statutory rate of percent for the year ended december  adjustments relating to the us impact of foreign operations increased the effective tax rate by percentage points in and decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points in included were adjustments for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and adjustments relating to the unremitted earnings calculations under applicable us gaap 
the components of this calculation were components of us tax impact of foreign operations dividends received from foreign subsidiaries foreign tax credits unremitted earnings total from to  the changes in components of the us tax impact of foreign operations were significant 
the primary reason the dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  the foreign tax credits and the unremitted earnings decreased were due to a reduction in repatriation of foreign earnings to the us from to changes to the effective rate due to dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  impact of foreign tax credits and unremitted earnings calculation are expected to be recurring  however  depending on various factors  the changes may be favorable or unfavorable for a particular period 
given the large number of jurisdictions in which the company does business and the number of factors that can impact effective tax rates in any given year  this rate is likely to reflect significant fluctuations from year to year

cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of net sales revenue decreased to percent in  compared to percent in these decreases were primarily due to reductions in product and material write offs  changes in product mix between markets and lower raw material costs  partially offset by increased importation fees related to higher transfer prices within some of our foreign markets 
volume incentives volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program  and represent commission payments made to our independent managers and distributors 
these payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels and for recruiting additional distributors 
volume incentives vary slightly  on a percentage basis  by product due to our pricing policies and commission plans in place and the sales mix in our various operations 
volume incentives as a percent of net sales revenue decreased to percent in  compared to percent in the decreases were primarily due to reductions in volume incentive rates due to our lower manager and distributor base within nsp americas  asia pacific and europe and an increase in product purchases that pay a lower sales commission rate in synergy worldwide

contract termination costs on july   we entered into a settlement agreement with nutriplus  from whom we acquired certain assets in in order to establish our russian business  and to whom we agreed to pay a percentage of net sales in our russian business in the form of a royalty payment  wherein both parties settled all claims in the arbitration  and bore their own costs associated with the arbitration 
as a result of the settlement  the company agreed to pay nutriplus million for the release of all past and future obligations 
of the million  the company applied million toward previously accrued but unpaid royalties which had been previously expensed  and million in exchange for the contract termination and extinguishment of future royalty obligations in for the year ended december   the company recorded and expensed royalty payments to nutriplus of approximately million included in selling  general and administrative expenses  which was approximately percent of nsp russia  central and eastern europe s revenue and percent of the company s consolidated revenue 
for the year ended december   the company recorded and expensed royalty payments to nutriplus of approximately million  which was approximately percent of nsp russia  central and eastern europe s revenue and percent of the company s consolidated revenue 

table of contents as a result of the settlement  our operating costs were reduced and our consolidated operating income was increased by million based on current sales volumes from our russian business 
this reduction in operating costs and corresponding increase in consolidated operating income will fluctuate based on future increases or decreases in sales from our russian business 
other income  net other income  net for the year ended december   decreased million  compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily due to prior year foreign exchange gains of million in venezuela as a result of the devaluation of the bolivar and the change to a highly inflationary economy that were non recurring and recognized in  offset by net foreign exchange gains and losses in certain of our other markets based on changes in exchange rates 
the decrease in other net income in had been offset by an increase in interest and other income  net of million due to the receipt of in restricted cash in venezuela that had been previously written down 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was percent for  compared to percent for the effective rate for differed from the federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the following i adjustments relating to the us tax impact of foreign operations decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points in included were adjustments for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and adjustments relating to outside basis calculations under applicable us gaap 
changes to the effective rate due to dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and outside basis are expected to be recurring 
ii changes in the unrecognized tax benefits increased the effective tax rate by percent in these net gains and losses were recorded for financial reporting purposes  but were excluded from the calculation of taxable income 
iii foreign tax rate differentials that incrementally affect the federal statutory rate decreased the effective tax rate by approximately percent in this is primarily due to differences between the lower statutory rates in foreign entities compared to the us statutory rate of percent 
as a net result of these and other differences  the effective tax rate for was less than the statutory rate of percent for the year ended december  adjustments relating to the us tax impact of foreign operations decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points in and increased the effective tax rate by percentage points in included were adjustments for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and adjustments relating to the unremitted earnings calculations under applicable us gaap 
the components of this calculation were components of us tax impact of foreign operations dividends received from foreign subsidiaries foreign tax credits unremitted earnings total between the years ended december  and  the changes in the components of the us tax impact of foreign operations were insignificant  except for the company s calculation of unremitted foreign earnings  which changed from an increase in the effective tax rate for to a decrease for the primary reason that the unremitted earnings caused an increase to the effective rate in and then a decrease in is that the company recorded adjustments in related to the settlement of irs audits of the company s open tax years as a result of these settlements  the company s historic foreign earnings in past years decreased  causing additional benefit in the company s unremitted earnings calculation  which in turn increased the net deferred tax asset related to unremitted earnings in changes to the effective rate due to dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  impact of foreign tax credits and the unremitted earnings calculation are expected to be recurring  however  depending on various factors  the changes may be favorable or unfavorable in a particular period 
given the large number of jurisdictions in which the company does business and the number of factors that can impact effective tax rates in any given year  this rate is likely to reflect relatively significant fluctuations from year to year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to grow our international operations 
net sales revenue  operating income and net income are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in international operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern international investment in countries where we have operations  as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in u

laws and regulations relating to international trade and investment 
foreign currency risk during the year ended december   approximately percent of our net sales revenue and approximately percent of our operating expenses were realized outside of the united states 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is generally the functional currency 
we conduct business in twenty three different currencies with exchange rates that are not on a one to one relationship with the us dollar 
all revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the periods reported 
therefore  our operating results will be positively or negatively affected by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to another fluctuating currency 
given the uncertainty and diversity of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition  but we have provided consolidated sensitivity analyses below of functional currency reporting currency exchange rate risks 
changes in various currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
we regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging  trading or speculating on foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
additional discussion of the impact on the effect of currency fluctuations has been included in our management s discussion and analysis included in part ii  item of this report 
the following table sets forth a composite sensitivity analysis of our net sales revenue  costs and expenses and operating income in connection with strengthening of the us dollar our reporting currency by  and against every other fluctuating functional currency in which we conduct business 
we note that our individual net sales revenue  cost and expense components and our operating income were equally sensitive to increases in the strength of the us dollar against every other fluctuating currency in which we conduct business 

table of contents exchange rate sensitivity for the year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands with strengthening of us dollar by net sales revenue cost and expenses cost of sales volume incentives selling  general and administrative operating income certain of our operations  including russia and the ukraine  are served by a us subsidiary through third party entities  for which all business is conducted in us dollars 
although changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the russian ruble or the ukrainian hryvnia do not result in currency fluctuations within our financial statements  a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to these other currencies can significantly affect the prices of our products and the purchasing power of our independent managers and distributors within these markets 
the following table sets forth a composite sensitivity analysis of our assets and liabilities by those balance sheet line items that are subject to exchange rate risk  together with the total gain or loss from the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to our various fluctuating functional currencies 
the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities  taken by balance sheet line items  is somewhat less than the sensitivity of our operating income to increases in the strength of the us dollar in relation to other fluctuating currencies in which we conduct business

none of our liabilities that are denominated in a local currency other than the us dollar and that are subject to exchange rate risk exceeded million upon translation into us dollars 
we use the spot exchange rate for translating balance sheet items from local currencies into our reporting currency 
the respective spot exchange rate for each such local currency meeting the foregoing thresholds is provided in the table as well

we use the annual average exchange rate for translating items from the statement of operations from local currencies into our reporting currency 
year ended december  canada dollar european markets euro japan yen korea won mexico peso the local currency of the foreign subsidiaries is used as the functional currency  except for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies or where the company s operations are served by a us based subsidiary for example  russia and the ukraine 
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries  where the local currency is the functional currency  are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at year end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each year for the results of operations 
adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income taxes 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the functional currency in highly inflationary economies is the us dollar and transactions denominated in the local currency are re measured as if the functional currency were the us dollar 
the re measurement of local currencies into us dollars creates translation adjustments  which are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
a country is considered to have a highly inflationary economy if it has a cumulative inflation rate of approximately percent or more over a three year period as well as other qualitative factors including historical inflation rate trends increasing and decreasing  the capital intensiveness of the operation and other pertinent economic factors

with the exceptions of venezuela and belarus  there were no other countries considered to have a highly inflationary economy during the periods ended december   and interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
these objectives are accomplished by purchasing investment grade securities
