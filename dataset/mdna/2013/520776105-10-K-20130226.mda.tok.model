item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview industry the mro business is significantly influenced by the overall strength of the manufacturing sector of the us economy 
one measure used to determine the strength of the industrial products market is the purchasing manufacturers index pmi published by the institute for supply management 
the pmi has declined to an average of in compared to in indicating a slowdown in the growth rate from a year ago 
the mro industry is highly fragmented 
we compete for business with several national distributors as well as a large number of regional and local distributors 
activities following are some of the highlights of the company for the year leadership change michael g 
decata joined lawson as president and ceo on october  bringing us significant mro distribution experience 
he previously served as president of chef warehouse and has also held senior positions at united rentals  ww grainger and general electric 
sales force transformation we developed the plans to transition our us sales team from an independent agent model to an employee based model 
effective january  all of our us based sales representatives became employees of the company 
distribution network consolidation we completed the integration of the operations previously conducted at our des plaines and vernon hills  illinois facilities into our new state of the art leased facility in mccook  illinois 
during the first half of we plan to move all of the distribution operations performed at our addison  illinois facility to the mccook facility 
website redesign we completed the development and testing of our redesigned website 
the new website was formally launched in the first quarter of credit facility we entered into a new five year million credit facility which we intend to use to fund our future operations and business initiatives 
erp stabilization during we continued to improve and resolve issues we encountered as a result of the implementation of our erp system in the second half of that continued to have an affect on our customer service in reduced cost structure we reduced our cost structure by eliminating over corporate and distribution positions 
we also introduced other cost cutting measures such as a rationalization of inventory and reduction of controllable costs such as travel  marketing and net outbound freight expenses 
we believe the steps taken in were necessary to set the company on a solid course for the future 
we will continue to strive to be our customers first choice for maintenance  repair and operational solutions

the decrease in sales representatives occurred primarily in the first half of and the size of the sales force stabilized in the second half of the year 
additionally  government sales decreased million in compared to primarily because we benefited from troop deployments in we anticipate that growth in the government segment may be limited given our past support to troop deployments which is not expected to increase in the near future

during payments of million were made for severance and million under our security bonus plan for sales representatives which were mostly offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable declined due to lower sales levels and the collection of past due amounts that built up in the second half of in  cash was primarily used to support increased levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
the increase in inventory was attributable to erp issues which negatively affected our procurement process and service level to customers 
these issues also led to delays in the collection of our receivables 
in  cash was primarily generated from operating income 
capital expenditures were million in compared to million in and million in capital expenditures in were primarily for warehouse equipment to support the opening of the new leased mccook  illinois distribution center  the build out of our new leased headquarters and expenditures related to our website redevelopment

in  we entered into a new five year million asset based credit facility 
the terms of the credit facility  including future covenant requirements are more fully detailed in 
note revolving line of credit of the consolidated financial statements included in item in addition to other customary representations  warranties and covenants  we are required to meet minimum quarterly consolidated ebitda levels as defined in the credit facility 
the minimum quarterly ebitda levels are detailed in the following table quarter ended minimum ebitda as defined in the credit facility december  march  june  september  december  march  june  for the quarter ended december   our quarterly ebitda level  as defined by the agreement  was million compared to the minimum ebitda level of million required by the agreement 
on december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility and we had additional borrowing availability of million 
we paid shareholder dividends of million in compared to million in and million in in the third quarter of  our board of directors voted to suspend our quarterly dividend to common stockholders that otherwise would have been paid in the fourth quarter of dividends are restricted under the credit facility to amounts not to exceed million per quarter subject to a formula based on ebitda achieved in the previous quarter compared to target amounts specified in the credit facility 
we believe cash expected to be provided by operations and the funds available under our credit facility are sufficient to fund our operating requirements  strategic initiatives and capital improvements throughout

payouts for known separation dates have been included in the scheduled year of payout  while payouts for unknown separation dates are reflected in the thereafter column 
off balance sheet arrangements we have a lease agreement for our headquarters which expires in march and includes total future minimum lease payments of million 
also  as of december   we had contractual commitments to purchase million of product from our suppliers and contractors in critical accounting policies we have disclosed our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following provides supplemental information to these accounting policies as well as information on the accounts requiring more significant estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit ratings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs as a percent of accounts receivable outstanding 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be revised by a material amount 
at december   our allowance reserve was of our gross accounts receivable outstanding 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance as a percent of our gross accounts receivable would have affected our annual doubtful accounts expense by approximately million 
inventory reserves inventories consist principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
most of our products are not exposed to the risk of obsolescence due to technology changes 
however  some of our products do have a limited shelf life  and from time to time we add and remove items from our catalogs  brochures or website for marketing and other purposes 
to reduce our inventory to a lower of cost or market value  we record a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical experience and monitoring current inventory activity 
we use estimates to determine the necessity of recording these reserves based on periodic detailed analysis reviews using both qualitative and quantitative factors 
as part of this analysis  we consider several factors including the inventories length of time on hand  historical sales  product shelf life  product life cycle  product category  and product obsolescence 
in general  depending on product category  we reserve inventory with low 
table of contents turnover at higher rates than inventory with high turnover 
our policy is to not re value inventory to the original cost basis subsequent to establishing a new cost basis 
at december   our inventory reserve was million  equal to approximately of our total inventory 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance as a percent of total inventory would have affected our cost of goods sold by million 
income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not ie greater than likely that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  the impact of tax planning strategies and the ability to carry back deferred tax assets to offset prior taxable income 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances  including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 
primarily due to the cumulative losses that we recorded over the past several quarters  we determined that it was more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income and increased our deferred tax valuation allowance to equal substantially all of our net tax assets 
therefore  substantially all future taxable income will be subject to this tax valuation allowance until the company can establish that the recoverability of its deferred tax assets is more certain 
goodwill impairment impairment of goodwill is evaluated using a three step process 
first  we look at qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances exist that would lead us to a determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if events or circumstances do exist that lead us to determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired  and thus  the third step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the third step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in the second quarter of  we identified indicators of impairment related to operating losses and reduced market capitalization and  therefore  performed an interim impairment test of goodwill 
we then estimated the fair value of our mro reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our current internal operating forecast to determine the reporting unit s fair value 
after completing the analysis  we concluded that the entire amount of the goodwill was impaired and a non cash charge of million was recorded 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk one of our subsidiaries is located and operates in canada using the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
operating results are translated into us dollars when consolidated into our financial statements 
therefore  we are exposed to market risk relating to the change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
a hypothetical change in the canadian foreign currency exchange rate would have affected our net sales by million and net assets by million 
certain compensation awards have been granted to our directors  officers and key employees that are payable in cash  based upon the market price of our common stock 
these awards are re measured each reporting period and the effect of the change in the share price is reflected in our operating results 
a hypothetical change in the price of our common stock on december  would have affected our operating results by million 
a number of our current and past employees have opted to defer a portion of their earned compensation to be paid at a future date 
these individuals have the ability to invest the deferred compensation in one or more portfolios that track the performance of various mutual funds 
as of december   the liability  which is based on the performance of these funds  was million 
additionally  we have invested funds in life insurance policies on certain executives 
the cash surrender value of these policies is invested in investment instruments similar to those supporting the deferred compensation liability 
as of december   the cash surrender value of these life insurance policies was million 
the change in the market value of the funds supporting our deferred compensation plan and the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies is recorded as a component of income and a hypothetical increase or decrease in the investment portfolios of both the cash value of life insurance asset and the deferred compensation liability would be immaterial as the underlying investments are intended to mirror the participants investment elections 
on december   we had million of borrowings outstanding on our revolving line of credit that are exposed to the market risk of fluctuations in the variable interest rate charged which is based on either the prime rate or the libor rate 
a hypothetical basis point change in the underlying interest rate charged on the december  debt balance would have an annual effect on operating results of million 
we are exposed to market risk relating to increased commodity and energy costs affecting the production costs of our vendors 
these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us and if we are unable to fully pass these costs through to our customers or to modify our activities  the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating profit margins
