item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our financial condition at december  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions the preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  requires us to establish policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in our judgment  the accounting policies  estimates and assumptions described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of specialty pharmaceutical products primarily eye care pharmaceuticals  skin care and urologics products to wholesalers within the united states  and we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
a portion of our revenue is generated from consigned inventory of breast implants maintained at physician  hospital and clinic locations 
these customers are contractually obligated to maintain a specific level of inventory and to notify us upon the use of consigned inventory 
revenue for consigned inventory is recognized at the time we are notified by the customer that the product has been used 
notification is usually through the replenishing of the inventory  and we periodically review consignment inventories to confirm the accuracy of customer reporting 
we generally offer cash discounts to customers for the early payment of receivables 
those discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the same period that the related sale is recorded 
the amounts reserved for cash discounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for cash discounts deducted from consolidated sales in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we permit returns of product from most product lines by any class of customer if such product is returned in a timely manner  in good condition and from normal distribution channels 
return policies in certain international markets and for certain medical device products  primarily breast implants  provide for more stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of product returns matched against sales  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
the amount of allowances for sales returns recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and were million and million  respectively  and are recorded in other accrued expenses and trade receivables  net in our consolidated balance sheets 
see note  composition of certain financial statement captions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
provisions for sales returns deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in the amount of allowances for sales returns at december  compared to december  and the provisions for sales returns in compared to are primarily due to increased overall product sales volume and an increase in allowances for sales returns related to our urologics products due to the launch of a competitive generic version of sanctura xr in the united states in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a decrease in estimated product sales return rates for our skin care products and breast aesthetics products 
the increase in the provisions for sales returns in compared to is primarily due to increased sales returns related to breast implant products  principally due to increased product sales volume  and an increase in estimated product sales return rates for our skin care products 
actual historical allowances for cash discounts and product returns have been consistent with the amounts reserved or accrued 
we participate in various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs  the largest of which relates to medicaid  medicare and the us department of veterans affairs 
sales rebate and other incentive programs also include contractual volume rebate programs and chargebacks  which are contractual discounts given primarily to federal government agencies  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefits managers and group purchasing organizations 
we also offer rebate and other incentive programs for our aesthetic products and certain therapeutic products  including botox cosmetic  juv derm  latisse  acuvail  aczone  sanctura xr and restasis  and for certain other skin care products 
sales rebates and incentive accruals 
table of contents reduce revenue in the same period that the related sale is recorded and are included in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in the amounts accrued at december  compared to december  and the provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs in compared to are primarily due to an increase in activity under previously established rebate and incentive programs  principally related to our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox cosmetic  urology  skin care and facial aesthetics products  an increase in the number of incentive programs offered and increased overall product sales volume 
the increase in the provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs in compared to are primarily due to an increase in activity under previously established rebate and incentive programs  principally related to our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox cosmetic  urology  skin care and facial aesthetics products  an increase in the number of incentive programs offered  additional contractual discounts to federal government agencies related to the recently enacted health care reform legislation and increased overall product sales volume 
in addition  an increase in our published list prices in the united states for pharmaceutical products  which occurred for several of our products in each of and  generally results in higher provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales 
our procedures for estimating amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at the end of any period are based on available quantitative data and are supplemented by management s judgment with respect to many factors  including but not limited to  current market dynamics  changes in contract terms  changes in sales trends  an evaluation of current laws and regulations and product pricing 
quantitatively  we use historical sales  product utilization and rebate data and apply forecasting techniques in order to estimate our liability amounts 
qualitatively  management s judgment is applied to these items to modify  if appropriate  the estimated liability amounts 
there are inherent risks in this process 
for example  customers may not achieve assumed utilization levels  customers may misreport their utilization to us  actual utilization and reimbursement rates under government rebate programs may differ from those estimated  and actual movements of the us consumer price index for all urban consumers  or cpi u  which affect our rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies  may differ from those estimated 
on a quarterly basis  adjustments to our estimated liabilities for sales rebates and other incentive programs related to sales made in prior periods have not been material and have generally been less than of consolidated product net sales 
an adjustment to our estimated liabilities of of consolidated product net sales on a quarterly basis would result in an increase or decrease to net sales and earnings before income taxes of approximately million to million 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program and type of customer 
additionally  there is a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated liability and when we actually pay the liability 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated liabilities over several periods  which can result in a net increase to earnings or a net decrease to earnings in those periods 
material differences may result in the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales if the actual amount of rebates and incentives differ materially from the amounts estimated by management 
we recognize license fees  royalties and reimbursement income for services provided as other revenues based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement 
in general  we recognize income upon the signing of a contractual agreement that grants rights to products or technology to a third party if we have no further obligation to provide products or services to the third party after entering into the contract 
we recognize contingent consideration earned from the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
we defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed 
contingent consideration contingent consideration liabilities represent future amounts we may be required to pay in conjunction with various business combinations 
the ultimate amount of future payments is based on specified future criteria  such as sales performance and the achievement of certain future development  regulatory and sales milestones and other contractual performance conditions 
we estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to sales performance using the income approach  which involves forecasting estimated future net cash flows and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using a risk adjusted rate of return 
we estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the achievement of future development and regulatory milestones by assigning an achievement probability to each potential milestone and discounting the associated cash payment to its present value using a risk adjusted rate of return 
we estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities associated with sales milestones by employing monte carlo simulations to estimate the volatility and systematic relative risk of revenues subject to sales milestone payments and discounting the associated cash payment amounts to their present values using a credit risk adjusted interest rate 
the fair value of other contractual performance conditions is measured by assigning an achievement probability to each payment and discounting the payment to its present value using our estimated cost of borrowing 
we evaluate our estimates of the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities on a periodic basis 
any changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recorded through earnings as selling  general and administrative in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
the total estimated fair value of contingent 
table of contents consideration liabilities was million and million at december  and  respectively  and was included in other accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
pensions we sponsor various pension plans in the united states and abroad in accordance with local laws and regulations 
our us pension plans account for a large majority of our aggregate pension plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations 
in connection with these plans  we use certain actuarial assumptions to determine the plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations  the most significant of which are the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate 
our assumption for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our us funded pension plan for determining the net periodic benefit cost is  and for  and  respectively 
our assumptions for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our non us funded pension plans are  and for  and  respectively 
for our us funded pension plan  we determine  based upon recommendations from our pension plan investment advisors  the expected rate of return using a building block approach that considers diversification and rebalancing for a long term portfolio of invested assets 
our investment advisors study historical market returns and preserve long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in a manner consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
they also evaluate market factors such as inflation and interest rates before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
for our non us funded pension plans  the expected rate of return was determined based on asset distribution and assumed long term rates of return on fixed income instruments and equities 
market conditions and other factors can vary over time and could significantly affect our estimates of the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected rate of return is applied to the market related value of plan assets 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in our rate of return on assets assumptions for our us and us funded pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit cost by approximately million 
the weighted average discount rates used to calculate our us and non us pension benefit obligations at december  were and  respectively  and at december  were and  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to calculate our us and us net periodic benefit costs for were and  respectively  for  and  respectively  and for  and  respectively 
we determine the discount rate based upon a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with maturities that mirror the pension benefit obligations at the plans measurement date 
market conditions and other factors can vary over time and could significantly affect our estimates for the discount rates used to calculate our pension benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for future years 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the discount rate assumption for our us and us pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit costs by approximately million and increase our pension plans projected benefit obligations at december  by approximately million 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors 
the fair value of share based awards is estimated at the grant date and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
the fair value of stock option awards that vest based on a service condition is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of share based awards that contain a market condition is generally estimated using a monte carlo simulation model  and the fair value of modifications to share based awards is generally estimated using a lattice model 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes  monte carlo simulation and lattice models is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we currently estimate stock price volatility based upon an equal weighting of the historical average over the expected life of the award and the average implied volatility of at the money options traded in the open market 
we estimate employee stock option exercise behavior based on actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options 
share based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest  and we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards for the purpose of calculating compensation cost 
these estimates will be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
compensation expense for share based awards based on a service condition is recognized using the straight line single option method 

table of contents product liability self insurance as of june   we are largely self insured for future product liability losses related to all of our products 
we have historically been and continue to be self insured for any product liability losses related to our breast implant products 
we maintain third party insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover potential product liability losses for injuries alleged to have occurred prior to june  related to botox and botox cosmetic and prior to june  related to all of our other products 
in addition  as a part of our current self insurance product liability practice  we maintain a layer of insurance coverage for potential product liability losses  excluding breast implant products  above a minimum self insured amount 
future product liability losses are  by their nature  uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities 
the factors to consider in developing product liability reserves include the merits and jurisdiction of each claim  the nature and the number of other similar current and past claims  the nature of the product use and the likelihood of settlement 
in addition  we accrue for certain potential product liability losses estimated to be incurred  but not reported  to the extent they can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate these accruals for potential losses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
the total value of self insured product liability claims settled in  and  respectively  and the value of known and reasonably estimable incurred but unreported self insured product liability claims pending as of december  are not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or liquidity 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of lower tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions  research and development  or r d  tax credits available in california and other foreign jurisdictions and deductions available in the united states for domestic production activities 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained  which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate  including factors such as the mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  the recognition or derecognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions  expected utilization of r d tax credits and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct business 
the american taxpayer relief act of was enacted on january  and retroactively reinstated the us r d tax credit to january  the retroactive benefit of the us r d tax credit for fiscal year is estimated to be approximately million and will be recognized in the first quarter of we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
changes in the valuation allowances  when they are recognized in the provision for income taxes  are included as a component of the estimated annual effective tax rate 
we have not provided for withholding and us taxes for the unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have currently reinvested these earnings indefinitely in these foreign operations 
at december   we had approximately  million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
income tax expense would be incurred if these earnings were remitted to the united states 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings 
upon remittance  certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available  subject to certain limitations  for use as credits against our us tax liability  if any 
we annually update our estimate of unremitted earnings outside the united states after the completion of each fiscal year 
acquisitions the accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of estimates and judgments to measure the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired can only be recognized as goodwill in a business combination 
on june   we acquired alacer biomedical  inc  or alacer  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
on july   we purchased the commercial assets related to the selling and distribution of our products from our distributor in south africa for million  net of a million pre existing receivable from the distributor 
on july   we acquired vicept therapeutics  inc  or vicept  for million in cash and estimated contingent consideration of million as of the acquisition date 
on august   we acquired precision light  inc  or precision light  for million in cash and estimated contingent consideration of million as of the acquisition date 
on february 
table of contents   we purchased the commercial assets related to the selling and distribution of our products from our distributor in russia for million in cash  net of a million pre existing net receivable from the distributor  and estimated contingent consideration of million as of the acquisition date 
on december   we acquired skinmedica  inc  or skinmedica  for million in cash and estimated contingent consideration of million as of the acquisition date 
we accounted for these acquisitions as business combinations 
the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with these acquisitions were recognized based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates 
the determination of estimated fair values requires significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
impairment evaluations for goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
we have identified two reporting units  specialty pharmaceuticals and medical devices  and perform our annual evaluation as of october each year 
for our specialty pharmaceuticals reporting unit  we performed the qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
for our medical devices reporting unit  we evaluated goodwill for impairment by comparing its carrying value to its estimated fair value 
we primarily use the income approach and the market approach to valuation that include the discounted cash flow method  the guideline company method  as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value 
upon completion of the october annual impairment assessment  we determined that no impairment was indicated 
as of december   we are not aware of any significant indicators of impairment that exist for our goodwill that would require additional analysis 
we also review intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment in the carrying value of an intangible asset is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an intangible asset are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the partial impairment of an indefinite lived in process research and development asset acquired in connection with our acquisition of vicept 
the impairment charge was recognized because the carrying amount of the asset was determined to be in excess of its estimated fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  we also recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses a net reduction in expense of million for a related decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the vicept acquisition 
for the fiscal year  the net decrease in the contingent consideration liability associated with the vicept acquisition was million 
in march  we decided to discontinue development of the easyband remote adjustable gastric band system  or easyband  a technology that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of endoart sa  or endoart 
as a result  in the first quarter of we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million for the intangible assets associated with the easyband technology 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of an in process research and development asset associated with a tissue reinforcement technology that has not yet achieved regulatory approval acquired in connection with our acquisition of serica technologies  inc  or serica 
the impairment charge was recognized because estimates of the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows of the asset were not sufficient to recover its carrying amount 
in the third quarter of  we concluded that the intangible assets and a related prepaid royalty asset associated with the sanctura franchise  or the sanctura assets  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of esprit pharma holding company  inc  or esprit  and certain subsequent licensing and commercialization transactions  had become impaired 
we determined that an impairment charge was required with respect to the sanctura assets because the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over their remaining useful life were not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the sanctura assets and the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of those assets due to a reduction in expected future financial performance for the sanctura franchise resulting from lower than anticipated acceptance by patients  physicians and payors 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recorded an aggregate charge of million related to the impairment of the sanctura assets and related costs  which includes a charge of million for the impairment of the sanctura intangible assets 
in the second quarter of  we recorded additional related costs of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million related to the prepaid royalty asset associated with the sanctura franchise due to the launch of a competitive generic version of sanctura xr 

table of contents on february   we completed our previously announced review of strategic options for maximizing the value of our obesity intervention business  and formally committed to pursue a sale of that business unit 
the obesity intervention business is included in our medical devices reporting unit for the annual goodwill impairment evaluation 
in the first quarter of  we expect to report our obesity intervention business as a discontinued operation  and accordingly will write down to fair value the net assets held for sale 
the net assets held for sale will include a portion of the medical devices reporting unit goodwill allocable to the obesity intervention business based on the relative fair value of the business to be disposed of and the portion of the medical devices reporting unit that will be retained 
we are currently unable to estimate the amount of goodwill that will be allocated to the obesity intervention business 
in addition  once a portion of goodwill is allocated to the net assets of the obesity intervention business to be disposed of  the goodwill remaining in the portion of the medical devices reporting unit that will be retained will be tested for impairment 
the evaluation for impairment of the remaining goodwill will occur in the first quarter of significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in our impairment evaluations 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur future impairment charges 
operations headquartered in irvine  california  we are a multi specialty health care company focused on developing and commercializing innovative pharmaceuticals  biologics  medical devices and over the counter products that enable people to live life to its full potential to see more clearly  move more freely and express themselves more fully 
we discover  develop and commercialize a diverse range of products for the ophthalmic  neurological  medical aesthetics  medical dermatology  breast aesthetics  obesity intervention  urological and other specialty markets in more than countries around the world 
we are also a pioneer in specialty pharmaceutical  biologic and medical device research and development 
our research and development efforts are focused on products and technologies related to the many specialty areas in which we currently operate as well as new specialty areas where unmet medical needs are significant 
we supplement our own research and development activities with our commitment to identify and obtain new technologies through in licensing  research collaborations  joint ventures and acquisitions 
at december   we employed approximately  persons around the world 
our principal geographic markets are the united states  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
results of operations we operate our business on the basis of two reportable segments specialty pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
the specialty pharmaceuticals segment produces a broad range of pharmaceutical products  including ophthalmic products for dry eye  glaucoma  inflammation  infection  allergy and retinal disease  botox for certain therapeutic and aesthetic indications  skin care products for acne  psoriasis  eyelash growth and other prescription and over the counter skin care products  and urologics products 
the medical devices segment produces a broad range of medical devices  including breast implants for augmentation  revision and reconstructive surgery and tissue expanders  obesity intervention products  and facial aesthetics products 
we provide global marketing strategy teams to coordinate the development and execution of a consistent marketing strategy for our products in all geographic regions that share similar distribution channels and customers 
management evaluates our business segments and various global product portfolios on a revenue basis  which is presented below in accordance with gaap 
we also report sales performance using the non gaap financial measure of constant currency sales 
constant currency sales represent current period reported sales  adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year 
we calculate the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported sales  calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year  to the actual current period reported sales 
we routinely evaluate our net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of our sales 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower  respectively  than growth reported at actual exchange rates

total glaucoma products include the alphagan and lumigan franchises 
product net sales product net sales increased by million in compared to due to an increase of million in our specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales and an increase of million in our medical devices product net sales 
the increase in specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales is due to increases in product net sales of our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox  and skin care product lines  partially offset by a decrease in product net sales of our urologics product line 
the increase in medical devices product net sales reflects an increase in product net sales of our breast aesthetics and facial aesthetics product lines  partially offset by a decrease in product net sales of our obesity intervention product line 
several of our products  including botox cosmetic  latisse  over the counter artificial tears  non prescription aesthetics skin care products  facial aesthetics and breast implant products  as well as  in emerging markets  botox for therapeutic use and eye care products  are purchased based on consumer choice and have limited reimbursement or are not reimbursable by government or other health care plans and are  therefore  partially or wholly paid for directly by the consumer 
as such  the general economic environment and level of consumer spending have a significant effect on our sales of these products 
in the united states  sales of our products that are reimbursable by government health care plans continue to be significantly impacted by the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  collectively  the ppaca  which extended medicaid and medicare benefits to new patient populations and increased medicaid and medicare rebates 
additionally  sales of our products in the united states that are reimbursed by managed care programs continue to be impacted by competitive pricing pressures 
in europe and some other international markets  sales of our products that are reimbursable by government health care plans continue to be impacted by mandatory price reductions  tenders and rebate increases 

table of contents certain of our products face generic competition 
in may  a generic version of our older generation topical allergy medication elestat was launched in the united states 
in june  the us patent for tazorac cream  indicated for psoriasis and acne  expired 
the us patents for tazorac gel expire in june the us food and drug administration  or fda  has posted guidance regarding requirements for clinical bioequivalence for a generic of tazarotene cream  separately for both psoriasis and acne 
we believe that this will require generic manufacturers to conduct a trial  at risk  for both indications 
in april  the us district court for the district of delaware ruled that our us patents for sanctura xr are invalid  a decision that was upheld by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit in june in october  a competitive generic version of sanctura xr was launched in the united states 
additionally  a generic version of zymar  our older generation fluoroquinolone indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis  may be launched in the united states in the near future 
our products also compete with generic versions of some branded pharmaceutical products sold by our competitors 
although generic competition in the united states negatively affected our aggregate product net sales in  the impact was not material 
we do not currently believe that our aggregate product net sales will be materially impacted in by generic competition  but we could experience a rapid and significant decline in net sales of certain products if we are unable to successfully maintain or defend our patents and patent applications relating to such products 
for a more complete discussion of the risks relating to generic competition and patent protection  see item a of part i of this report  risk factors we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property rights 
eye care pharmaceuticals product net sales increased in compared to in the united states  canada  europe and asia pacific 
net sales of eye care pharmaceutical products in latin america decreased in compared to due to the negative translation effect of average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during compared to when measured at constant currency  net sales of eye care pharmaceutical products in latin america increased in compared to the overall increase in total sales in dollars of our eye care pharmaceutical products is primarily due to an increase in sales of restasis  our therapeutic treatment for chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of our glaucoma products  including lumigan  combigan  alphagan p and alphagan p  an increase in sales of ozurdex  our biodegradable  sustained release steroid implant for the treatment of certain retinal diseases  an increase in sales of lastacaft  our topical allergy medication for the treatment and prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  and an increase in sales of our refresh artificial tears products  partially offset by decreases in sales of our older generation products  including our glaucoma drugs alphagan and lumigan  and our topical allergy medication elestat  and decreases in sales of our fluoroquinolone products zymar and zymaxid and our non steroid anti inflammatory drugs acular and acuvail 
we increased prices on certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states in effective january   we increased the published us list price for alphagan p by three percent  acular  acular ls and acuvail by four percent  lumigan and lumigan by five percent  alphagan p  combigan and zymaxid by eight percent and lastacaft by ten percent 
effective april   we increased the published us list price for restasis by five percent 
effective may   we increased the published us list price for lastacaft by an additional five percent  alphagan p  alphagan p  lumigan  lumigan and combigan by an additional eight percent  and acular  acular ls  acuvail and zymaxid by an additional ten percent 
these price increases had a positive net effect on our us sales in compared to  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of the prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars  although we are unable to determine the impact of these effects 
due to the strong acceptance of lumigan in the united states market  we ceased manufacturing lumigan for the us market in the fourth quarter of total sales of botox increased in compared to due to strong growth in sales for both therapeutic and cosmetic uses 
sales of botox for therapeutic use increased in the united states due to strong growth in sales for the prophylactic treatment of headaches in adults with chronic migraine  urinary incontinence in adults with neurological conditions  and upper limb spasticity 
sales of botox for therapeutic use also increased in latin america and asia pacific 
sales of botox for cosmetic use increased in all of our principal geographic markets 
sales of botox in international markets were negatively affected by the translation effect of average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during compared to when measured at constant currency  total sales of botox increased in europe in compared to based on internal information and assumptions  we estimate in that botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and increased by approximately compared to in  botox cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and increased by approximately compared to we believe our worldwide market share for neuromodulators  including botox  was approximately in the third quarter of  the last quarter for which market data is available 
in march  a us district court  after conducting a full trial  ruled that merz pharmaceuticals and merz aesthetics  or  jointly  merz  violated california uniform trade secrets act and issued an injunction prohibiting merz from providing  selling or soliciting purchases of xeomin or its radiesse dermal filler products  provided that merz may sell xeomin in the

on october   the company announced that the us district court had entered an order providing that the injunction related to xeomin for the facial aesthetics market would remain in place until january  the injunction related to xeomin for therapeutic use and radiesse was in effect until november  the district court injunctions positively affected net sales of botox and provided a small benefit to net sales of juv derm in skin care product net sales increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in sales of aczone  our topical dapsone treatment for acne vulgaris  an increase in sales of tazorac  zorac and avage  our topical tazarotene products and an increase in sales of latisse  our treatment for inadequate or insufficient eyelashes 
effective january   we increased the published us list price for aczone  tazorac and avage by five percent 
effective may   we increased the published us list price for aczone by an additional three percent 
urologics sales  which are presently concentrated in the united states and consist of our sanctura franchise products for the treatment of overactive bladder  or oab  decreased in compared to  primarily due to lower sales of sanctura xr  our second generation  once daily anticholinergic for the treatment of oab  which was negatively impacted by a decrease in promotional activity and the launch of a competitive generic version of sanctura xr in the united states in october effective january   we increased the published us list price for sanctura xr by nine percent and sanctura by ten percent

breast aesthetics product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of silicone gel and saline breast implants and tissue expanders  increased in compared to due to increases in sales in all of our principal geographic markets 
the increase in sales of breast aesthetics products in the united states was primarily due to higher implant and tissue expander unit volume and favorable product mix due to the continued transition of the us market to higher priced tissue expanders and silicone gel products from lower priced saline products  partially offset by a small decline in market share due to the entrance of a new competitor in the us market 
the overall increase in sales of breast aesthetics products in our international markets was primarily due to higher unit volume  offset by the negative translation effect of average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during compared to obesity intervention product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of devices used for minimally invasive long term treatments of obesity such as our lap band and lap band ap systems and orbera system  decreased in compared to in all of our principal geographic markets  except brazil 
we believe sales of obesity intervention products in the united states and other principal geographic markets continued to be negatively impacted by general economic conditions given the substantial patient co pays associated with these products  government spending restrictions and access restrictions imposed by insurance plans 
in addition  net sales of our obesity intervention products continued to be negatively impacted by a general increase in the market share of other competitive bariatric surgery procedures  especially in the united states and australia 
sales in brazil increased due to increased unit volumes sold of orbera 
in october  we announced that we were exploring strategic options for maximizing the value of our obesity intervention business

beginning in february we discontinued the us sales of zymar 
we increased prices on certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states in effective january   we increased the published us list price for restasis  alphagan p  alphagan p  combigan  zymar  zymaxid  acular  acular ls and acuvail by four percent and lumigan and lumigan by eight percent

effective september   we increased the published us list price for lumigan and lumigan by an additional six percent  and effective october   we increased the published us list price for restasis by an additional five percent 
these price increases had a positive net effect on our us sales in compared to  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of the prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars  although we are unable to determine the impact of these effects 
total sales of botox increased in compared to due to an increase in sales of botox for both cosmetic and therapeutic use in all of our principal geographic markets 
sales of botox for therapeutic use in the united states benefited from sales for the prophylactic treatment of headaches in adults with chronic migraine and the treatment of upper limb spasticity  indications which were approved by the fda in in europe  sales of botox for therapeutic use were negatively impacted in by government mandated price reductions  and sales of botox for cosmetic use  marketed as vistabel vistabex  were negatively impacted in due to launches of competitive products in certain geographical markets

facial aesthetics product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of hyaluronic acid based dermal fillers used to correct facial wrinkles  increased in compared to primarily due to a significant increase in sales in the united states and all of our other principal geographic markets 
we believe the increase in sales of facial aesthetic products was primarily due to an increase in sales of juv derm xc with lidocaine in the united states  recent launches of juv derm with lidocaine and juv derm voluma in many of our international markets and a global expansion of the dermal filler market  partially offset by a decline in sales of older generation collagen based dermal fillers  which we discontinued selling in early foreign currency changes increased product net sales by million in compared to  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro  australian dollar  brazilian real  canadian dollar and uk pound compared to the us dollar

other revenues in include the achievement of substantive milestones related to the approval of aiphagan in japan and the achievement of two sales milestones related to sales of lumigan in japan

future funding requirements are subject to change depending on the actual return on net assets in our funded pension plans and changes in actuarial assumptions

generic versions of elestat and sanctura xr were launched in the united states in may and october  respectively  and a generic version of zymar may be launched in the united states in the near future 
in addition  our products compete with generic versions of some branded pharmaceutical products sold by our competitors 
we do not believe that our liquidity will be materially impacted in by generic competition 
as of december    million of our existing cash and equivalents and short term investments are held by non us subsidiaries 
we currently plan to use these funds indefinitely in our operations outside the united states 
withholding and us taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have reinvested these earnings indefinitely in such operations 
at december   we had approximately  million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax costs would be incurred if these earnings were remitted to the united states 
we sell products to public and semi public hospitals in italy and spain  which are wholly or partially funded by their respective sovereign governments

however  the economic stability in these countries is unpredictable and we cannot provide assurance that additional allowances will not be necessary if current economic conditions in these countries continue to decline 
negative changes in the amount of allowances for doubtful accounts could adversely affect our future results of operations 
as of december   we have no significant trade accounts receivable from customers in greece or portugal that are primarily funded by their respective sovereign governments 

table of contents we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our existing credit facilities and existing cash and equivalents and short term investments  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our current expected obligations  working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years and at the end of  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our product net sales in were derived from operations outside the united states  and a portion of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure  as we deem appropriate 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales was a decrease of million in and an increase of million in the sales decrease included million related to the euro  million related to the brazilian real  million related to the indian rupee  million related to the turkish lira  million related to the mexican peso  million related to the canadian dollar  million related to the uk pound and million related to other currencies

in determining the minimum required funding  we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future 
in management s judgment  minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated 
where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of local statutory requirements  additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources 
c other long term obligations include contingent consideration liabilities  deferred executive compensation liabilities and certain other obligations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules  for activities relating to interest rate and foreign currency risk management 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure you that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
as of december   we had no interest rate swap contracts outstanding 
however  we may from time to time seek to enter into interest rate hedge transactions in the future 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense are more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents and short term investments and interest expense on our debt  as well as costs associated with foreign currency contracts 
on january   we entered into a nine year  two month interest rate swap with a million notional amount with semi annual settlements and quarterly interest rate reset dates 
the swap received interest at a fixed rate of and paid interest at a variable interest rate equal to month libor plus  and effectively converted million of the million aggregate principal amount of our notes to a variable interest rate 
based on the structure of the hedging relationship  the hedge met the criteria for using the short cut method for a fair value hedge 
the investment in the derivative and the related long term debt were recorded at fair value 
the differential to be paid or received as interest rates change was accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense related to the notes 
in september  we terminated the interest rate swap and received million  which included accrued interest of million 
upon termination of the interest rate swap  we added the net fair value received of million to the carrying value of the notes 
the amount received for the termination of the interest rate swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the debt  which effectively fixes the interest rate for the remaining term of the notes at 
as of december   the unamortized amount of the terminated interest rate swap that was included in the carrying value of the notes was million 
at december   we recognized in our consolidated balance sheet an asset reported in investments and other assets and a corresponding increase in long term debt associated with the fair value of the derivative of million 
during  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  as a reduction of interest expense due to the effect of the interest rate swap 
in february  we entered into interest rate swap contracts based on month libor with an aggregate notional amount of million  a swap period of years and a starting swap rate of 
we entered into these swap contracts as a cash flow hedge to effectively fix the future interest rate for our notes 
in april  we terminated the interest rate swap contracts and received approximately million 
the total gain is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over a year period to match the term of the notes 
as of december   the remaining unrecognized gain  net of tax  of million is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million 
commercial paper  when outstanding  is issued at current short term interest rates
