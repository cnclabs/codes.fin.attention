results of operations comparison of years ended december  and consolidated year ended december  consolidated revenues loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income loss net income loss per common share 
table of contents we reported net loss of million or per share for compared to net income of million or per share for consolidated revenues for include the january sale of an acre parcel in upcountry maui for million

we had no sales of real estate inventory in the other revenues included in this operating segment were real estate sales commissions from kapalua realty company totaling million for and million for real estate development and sales are cyclical and depend on a number of factors 
results for one period are therefore not necessarily indicative of future performance trends in this segment 
leasing year ended december  revenues operating profit loss the increase in leasing revenues in is primarily due to improved operating performance of our resort tenants and new commercial space and agricultural land leases 
the increase in operating profit for is attributed to lower general and administrative expenses and improved performance from outsourcing the management of our commercial property portfolio in utilities year ended december  revenues operating profit loss the increase in operating profit for is primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses and improved performance from the outsourcing of our utilities companies operations in february

results of operations presented above for the reportable operating segments include an allocation of a portion of the general and administrative expenses at the corporate level 
such allocations are made on the basis of our evaluation of the level of services provided to the operating segments

general and administrative expenses for include a million contribution of approximately acres to maui preparatory academy 
selling and marketing expenses decreased from  in to  in  as we discontinued operating certain businesses  and the lessees and licensees of our properties and trade names assumed the responsibility for marketing 
discontinued operations year ended december  income from discontinued operations before income taxes our former retail  golf and agriculture operations are reported as discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations for includes a million gain from the sale of the bay course 
see note to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
interest expense interest expense was million for compared to million for  of which  was included in discontinued operations in our average interest rates on borrowings was for  compared to for  and average borrowings were million in compared to million in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   our total debt was million compared to million at december  at december   we had approximately million available under our revolving line of credit and  in cash and cash equivalents 
revolving line of credit with wells fargo we have a million revolving line of credit with wells fargo that was scheduled to mature on may  in february  we exercised our option to extend the maturity date to may  interest rates on borrowings are at libor plus and the line of credit is collateralized by approximately acres of our real estate holdings at the kapalua resort 
the line of credit agreement contains various representations  warranties  affirmative  negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type 
financial covenants include a required minimum liquidity as defined of million  maximum total liabilities of million  and a limitation on new indebtedness 
the credit agreement includes predetermined release prices for the real property securing the credit facility 
there are no commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving facility 
absent the sale of some of our real estate holdings or refinancing  we do not expect to be able to repay any significant amount of borrowings under the credit line 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit  million available borrowing capacity and irrevocable letters of credit totaling million that were secured by the line of credit 
term loan with american agcredit we have a million term loan with american agcredit that was scheduled to mature on may  in february  we amended our term loan agreement to extend the maturity date to may  the interest rate on this credit facility is based on the greater of or the day libor rate  plus an applicable spread of 
the loan agreement provides for tiered reductions in the applicable spread to  subject to corresponding reductions in the principal balance of the loan 
the loan requires a mandatory principal repayment of million by december  the loan agreement contains various representations  warranties  affirmative  negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type 
financial covenants include a required minimum liquidity as defined of million  maximum total liabilities of million and a limitation on new indebtedness 
it also requires mandatory principal repayments of of the net proceeds of the sale of any real property pledged as collateral for the loan and tiered mandatory principal repayments based on predetermined percentages ranging from to of the net proceeds from the sale of non collateralized real property 
in accordance with this provision  we made a  principal repayment in january  in conjunction with a sale of a non collateralized real estate parcel in upcountry maui for million 
the loan is collateralized by approximately  acres of our real estate holdings in west maui and upcountry maui 
absent the sale of some of our real estate holdings or refinancing  we do not expect to be able to pay the outstanding balance under the term loan on the maturity date 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities for was million compared to million in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to our initiatives to reduce cash commitments  mainly by implementing cost reduction measures 
during  net borrowings from our wells fargo revolving line of credit were million 
in  repayments of our american agcredit term loan were  interest paid in and 
table of contents was million and million  respectively 
mandatory funding contributions to our retirement plans totaled million for both and future cash inflows and outflows our plans for include the possible sale of certain operating and non operating real estate assets that could result in net cash proceeds which would be partially used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general working capital 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any of our real estate assets on acceptable terms  if at all 
our cash outlook for the next twelve months and our ability to continue to meet our loan covenants and to continue as a going concern is highly dependent on successfully implementing our business initiatives and selling real estate assets at acceptable prices 
if we are unable to meet our loan covenants resulting in our loan borrowings becoming immediately due  we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay such outstanding borrowings 
we are subject to several commitments and contingencies that could negatively impact our future cash flows  including purchase commitments up to million related to our investment in bay holdings to purchase the amenities  an eeoc matter related to our discontinued agricultural operations  and funding requirements related to our defined benefit pension plans 
these matters are further described in notes  and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the aforementioned circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve the initiatives discussed below in order to continue as a going concern 
in response to these circumstances  we continue to undertake significant efforts to generate cash flow by employing our real estate assets in leasing and other arrangements  by the sale of several real estate assets and by continued cost reduction efforts 
we are in active negotiations with the lenders of the residences at kapalua bay project to resolve our limited guarantees and purchase commitment for the amenities 
contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately million in we do not anticipate any significant capital expenditures in critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in summary of significant accounting policies  note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of accounting estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions involve a high level of subjectivity and judgment and therefore the impact of a change in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to the consolidated financial statements are as follows our investment in bay holdings was written down to zero at december  to recognize an other than temporary impairment and to record losses incurred by bay holdings in the third quarter of we and the other members of bay holdings have guaranteed to the lenders completion of the project and recourse with regard to certain acts  and we have recorded million in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  as our share of the completion and recourse guarantees 
in determining the fair value of this investment  assessing whether any identified impairment was other than temporary  as well as estimating the liability for the completion and recourse guarantees  significant estimates were made and considerable judgment was involved 
these estimates and judgments were based  in 
table of contents part  on our current and future evaluation of economic conditions in general  as well as bay holdings current and future plans 
these impairment calculations contain additional uncertainties because they also require management to make assumptions and apply judgments to  among others  estimates of future cash flows  probabilities related to various cash flow scenarios  and appropriate discount rates 
the impairment losses recorded by bay holdings required bay holdings management to estimate total sales revenues that will be received by the project  as well as estimating the number of buyers of units from which nonrefundable deposits have been received that will not close on the purchase of their units 
our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset may not be recoverable 
these asset impairment loss analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to  among others  estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows  expected useful lives of the assets  uncertainty about future events  including changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance  changes in the use of the assets  and ongoing costs of maintenance and improvements of the assets  thus  the accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  our financial condition or future operating results could be materially impacted 
deferred development costs  principally predevelopment costs and offsite development costs related to various projects in the planning stages by our real estate segment  totaled million at december  based on our future development plans for the kapalua resort and other properties such as pulelehua  and hali imaile town  and the estimated value of these future projects  management has concluded that these deferred costs will be recoverable from future development projects 
the volatility of this assumption arises because of the long term nature of our development plans and the uncertainty of when or if certain parcels will be developed 
determining pension expense for our two defined benefit pension plans utilizes actuarial estimates of employees age at retirement  retirees life span  the long term rate of return on investments and other factors 
in addition  pension expense is sensitive to the discount rate utilized 
this rate should be commensurate with the interest rate yield of a high quality corporate fixed income investment portfolio 
these assumptions are subject to the risk of change as they require significant judgment and have inherent uncertainties that management or its consulting actuaries may not control or anticipate 
as of december   the fair value of the assets of our defined benefit plans totaled approximately million  compared with million as of december  the recorded net pension liability was approximately million as of december  compared to a net pension liability of million as of december  the million increase in net pension liability during was mainly attributed to a decline in the discount rate used to determine our pension obligations 
stock based compensation expense is calculated based on assumptions as to the expected life of the options  price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected forfeitures 
while management believes that the assumptions made are appropriate  current and future compensation expense could vary based on the assumptions used 
management calculates the income tax provision  current and deferred income taxes along with the valuation allowance based upon various complex estimates and interpretations of income tax laws and regulations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
to the extent we begin to generate taxable income in future years  and it is determined the valuation allowance is no longer required  the tax benefit for the remaining deferred tax assets will be recognized at such time 

table of contents as of december   valuation allowances of million have been established primarily for tax credits  net operating loss carry forwards  and accrued retirement benefits to reduce future tax benefits expected to be realized 
our results of operations could be affected by significant litigation or contingencies adverse to the company  including  but not limited to  liability claims  environmental matters  and contract terminations 
we record accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we make adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter 
predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from those estimates 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the nature of specific claims  our experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed  input from outside legal counsel  the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter current status 
a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters and contingencies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
impact of inflation and changing prices most of the land owned by us was acquired from to and is carried at cost 
at the kapalua resort  some of the fixed assets were constructed and placed in service in the mid to late s 
depreciation expense would be considerably higher if fixed assets were stated at current cost 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because we qualify as a smaller reporting company  as defined in item f of regulation s k  we are not required to provide the information required by this item
