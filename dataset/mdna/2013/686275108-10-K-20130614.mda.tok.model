risk factors 
recent management change and strategic refocus in september  our board of directors elected john h 
scribante as our new chief executive officer 
prior to his appointment  mr 
scribante was the president of our orion engineered systems division and had also served in executive sales management positions 
as a result of this management change  we refocused our strategic initiatives to include i enhancing and refocusing our sales organization with an emphasis on expanding our direct sales efforts  ii streamlining our product development initiatives with a focus on activities that will deliver the greatest return on our investment and disciplined product control releases versus a process of continuous development  and iii cost reduction initiatives to deliver profitability 
our strategic refocus delivered immediate financial results during our fiscal second half resulting in revenue growth versus our fiscal second half and a return to profitability 
during fiscal  we recorded operating expenses related to reorganization costs of million  which included million to general and administrative expenses and million to sales and marketing expenses 
additionally  we recorded a million non cash income tax expense to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as part of our cost reduction initiatives  we identified additional cost containment initiatives which we believe will result in annualized cost reductions of approximately million 
during the fiscal second half  we implemented all of these cost reduction initiatives  including a reduction in headcount of approximately  the termination of consulting agreements  material and component cost savings in our hif lighting products  and discretionary spending reductions 
we have also identified an additional million of annualized cost containment initiatives which we are working towards implementing in the future 
these new initiatives will require some time to implement due to contractual obligations  engineering review  production planning and other analysis related to ensuring minimal business interruption and risk 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to implement these cost containment opportunities and recognize any of these additional cost savings 
as noted above  we are actively expanding our direct sales force 
during fiscal  we have increased our in market sales force and expect to continue to increase our sales headcount during our fiscal year 
we expect that these additional costs will increase our overall sales and marketing expense in fiscal by approximately million and that the net benefit of these additions and our implemented cost containment initiatives will result in reduced annual expenses of approximately million 
in may  we executed a purchase agreement to acquire the equity interest of harris manufacturing  inc and harris led  llc  or collectively harris 
harris engineers  designs  sources and manufactures energy efficient lighting systems  including fluorescent and led lighting solutions  and day lighting products 
we expect the acquisition of harris to expand our product lines  increase our sales force and provide growth opportunities into markets where we have not had a strong presence  specifically  new construction  retail  commercial office and government 
we expect to close the transaction during our fiscal second quarter  subject to various conditions  including receipt of material third party consents and approvals and other customary closing conditions 
the initial purchase price for the transaction is million  subject to closing date adjustments for net working capital  funded debt and certain other items 
subject to such adjustments  the purchase price will be paid in a combination of million of cash  million in a three year unsecured subordinated note and million of our common stock 
additionally  we may pay up to an additional million in shares of our common stock upon harris post closing achievement of certain revenue milestones in calendar year and or harris had unaudited revenue of approximately million and unaudited net income of approximately million during the year ended december  we expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to 
table of contents our future earnings 
our disclosures and comments that follow  do not include the impact or the anticipated impact of the acquisition of harris  other than as set forth under liquidity and capital resources 
overview we design  manufacture  market and implement energy management systems consisting primarily of high performance  energy efficient lighting systems  controls and related services and market and implement renewable energy systems consisting primarily of solar generating photovoltaic  or pv  systems and wind turbines 
we operate in two business segments  which we refer to as our energy management division and our engineered systems division 
we typically generate a majority of our revenue from sales of high intensity fluorescent  or hif  lighting systems and related services to commercial and industrial customers 
we typically sell our hif lighting systems in replacement of our customers existing high intensity discharge  or hid  fixtures 
we call this replacement process a retrofit 
we frequently engage our customer s existing electrical contractor to provide installation and project management services 
we also sell our hif lighting systems on a wholesale basis  principally to electrical contractors and value added resellers to sell to their own customer bases 
we have more recently introduced new products of our light emitting diode  or led  lighting and energy management systems 
we believe that we have taken a responsible approach to this emerging technology 
based upon recent improvements  including drastic reduction of chip prices  availability of name brand drivers and the integration with our intelite controls offerings  we believe that led will become a larger part of our overall interior and exterior lighting strategy in the future 
we believe that our new led product offerings also present new opportunities in the hospitality  health care  education  office and general retail markets  in addition to strengthening our position as an energy management leader in the commercial  industrial and food service markets 
we have sold and installed more than million of our hif lighting systems in more than  facilities from december  through march  our top direct customers by revenue in fiscal included coca cola enterprises inc  pepsico inc  us foodservice  sysco corp  quad graphics  inc and wakefern food corporation 
our fiscal year ends on march we call our fiscal years which ended on march   and  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our fiscal first quarter ends on june  our fiscal second quarter ends on september  our fiscal third quarter ends on december and our fiscal fourth quarter ends on march because of the recessed state of the global economy since  especially as it impacts capital equipment manufacturers  our results for fiscal continued to be impacted by lengthened customer sales cycles and sluggish customer capital spending 
to address these difficult economic conditions  we implemented several cost reduction initiatives 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we identified million of annualized cost reductions related to decreased product costs  improved manufacturing efficiencies and reduced operating expenses 
we realized these cost reductions beginning during the fiscal third quarter through reduction in general and administrative expenses and improved product margins for our hif lighting systems 
during fiscal  in recognition of an improving economy compared to the previous year  we focused our efforts on activities to increase revenue 
these investments included the creation of a telemarketing call center for the purpose of customer lead generation  the establishment of a sales office and hiring of personnel in houston  texas and headcount additions to our retail sales force and our engineered systems division 
during fiscal  we implemented additional cost containment initiatives as described in the preceding section titled recent management change and strategic refocus 
in response to the constraints on our customers capital spending budgets  we have more aggressively promoted the advantages to our customers of purchasing our energy management systems through our orion throughput agreement  or ota  financing program 
our ota financing program provides for our customer s purchase of our energy management systems without an up front capital outlay 
during fiscal  we entered into an arrangement with a national equipment finance company to provide immediate non recourse and recourse funding of pre credit approved ota finance contracts upon project completion and customer acceptance 
the majority of these sales occur on a non recourse basis 
during fiscal  approximately of our total completed ota contracts were financed directly through third party equipment finance companies 
in the future  we intend to continue to utilize third party finance companies to fund the majority of our ota contracts 
additionally  during fiscal we completed a million ota line of credit for the purpose of funding ota projects upon the project completion and customer acceptance  for which we chose to hold the contracts internally 
in the future  we do not intend to fund ota contracts through debt borrowings 
in future periods  the number of customers who choose to purchase our systems by using our ota financing program will be dependent upon our relationships with third party equipment finance companies  the extent to which customers choose to use their own capital budgets and the extent to which customers choose to enter into finance contracts 
additionally  we have provided a financing program to our alternative renewable energy system customers called a solar power purchase agreement  or ppa  as an alternative to purchasing our systems for cash 
the ppa is a supply side agreement for the generation of electricity and subsequent sale to the end user 
we do not intend to use our own cash balances to fund future ppa opportunities and have been able to secure several external sources of funding for ppa s on behalf of our customers 

table of contents in august  we created our engineered systems division  which has been offering our customers additional alternative renewable energy systems 
during our fiscal second quarter  we received an million cash order for a solar pv generating system for which we recognized revenue in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded million in new contracted revenues across contracts 
during fiscal  we did not sign any significant new solar contracts 
we attribute this to the december expiration of federal cash grants available for solar projects  declining solar prices for panels  an unstable supply environment  including bankruptcy filings from several solar panel suppliers  and a decline in the value of state and utility incentives 
due to the reduction in new solar contracts  during the back half of fiscal we redeployed some of our engineered systems personnel to focus on the sales and project management support of our hif lighting systems 
we are currently focused on solar opportunities in markets where electricity costs are high and there are incentive markets that provide funding to support these projects 
despite our fiscal first half performance  we remain optimistic about our near term and long term financial performance 
our near term optimism is based upon our return to profitability during our fiscal second half  our backlog of orders entering fiscal  our investments into our retail sales force and our intentions to continue to expand our retail sales force during fiscal  our cost containment initiatives and opportunities  the increasing volume of unit sales of our new products  specifically our exterior hif fixtures and the opportunities to increase sales through our new led products which will allow us to expand into new markets 
our long term optimism is based upon the considerable size of the existing market opportunity for lighting retrofits  the continued development of our new products and product enhancements  the opportunity for additional revenue from sales of renewable technologies through our orion engineered systems division and the opportunity to increase gross margins through the leverage of our under utilized manufacturing capacity 
revenue and expense components revenue 
we sell our energy management products and services directly to commercial and industrial customers  and indirectly to end users through wholesale sales to electrical contractors and value added resellers 
we currently generate the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of hif lighting systems and related services to commercial and industrial customers 
while our services include comprehensive site assessment  site field verification  utility incentive and government subsidy management  engineering design  project management  installation and recycling in connection with our retrofit installations  we separately recognize service revenue only for our installation and recycling services 
our installation and recycling service revenues are recognized when services are complete and customer acceptance has been received 
in fiscal and fiscal  we increased our efforts to expand our value added reseller channels  including through developing a partner standard operating procedural kit  providing our partners with product marketing materials and providing training to channel partners on our sales methodologies 
these wholesale channels accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue volume in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  not taking into consideration our renewable technologies revenue generated through our engineered systems division 
in fiscal  we focused our expansion efforts on our direct retail sales channel through the creation of a telemarketing call center for the purpose of customer lead generation  the establishment of a sales office and personnel in houston  texas and headcount additions to our retail sales force and our engineered systems division 
during the fiscal second half  we reengineered our telemarketing call center for the purpose of improving the quality of leads and increasing sales closing ratios 
we also continued the expansion of a direct in market sales force and intend to continue increasing the number of direct sales personnel during fiscal additionally  we offer our ota sales type financing program under which we finance the customer s purchase of our energy management systems 
the ota program was established to assist customers who are interested in purchasing our energy management systems but who have capital expenditure budget limitations 
our ota contracts are capital leases under gaap and we record revenue at the present value of the future payments at the time customer acceptance of the installed and operating system is complete 
our ota contracts under this sales type financing are either structured with a fixed term  typically months  and a bargain purchase option at the end of term  or are one year in duration and  at the completion of the initial one year term  provide for i one to four automatic one year renewals at agreed upon pricing  ii an early buyout for cash  or iii the return of the equipment at the customer s expense 
the revenue that we are entitled to receive from the sale of our lighting fixtures under our ota financing program is fixed and is based on the cost of the lighting fixtures and applicable profit margin 
our revenue from agreements entered into under this program is not dependent upon our customers actual energy savings 
we recognize revenue from ota contracts at the net present value of the future cash flows at the completion date of the installation of the energy management systems and the customers acknowledgment that the system is operating as specified 
upon completion of the installation  we may choose to sell the future cash flows and residual rights to the equipment on a non recourse basis to an unrelated third party finance company in exchange for cash and future payments 
in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ota contracts 
in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ota contracts 
in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ota contracts 
our ppa financing program provides for our customer s purchase of electricity from our renewable energy generating assets without an upfront capital outlay 
our ppa is a longer term contract  typically in excess of years  in which we receive monthly 
table of contents payments over the life of the contract 
this program creates an ongoing recurring revenue stream  but reduces near term revenue as the payments are recognized as revenue on a monthly basis over the life of the contract versus upfront upon product shipment or project completion 
in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ppas 
in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ppas 
in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ppas 
as of march   we had signed one customer to two separate ppas representing future potential discounted revenue streams of million 
we discount the future revenue from ppas due to the long term nature of the contracts  typically in excess of years 
the timing of expected future discounted gaap revenue recognition and the resulting operating cash inflows from ppas  assuming the systems perform as designed  was as follows as of march  in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal beyond total expected future discounted revenue from ppa for sales of our solar pv systems  which are governed by customer contracts that require us to deliver functioning solar power systems and are generally completed within three to months from the start of project construction  we recognize revenue from fixed price construction contracts using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenue arising from fixed price construction contracts is recognized as work is performed based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total forecasted costs 
we have determined that the appropriate method of measuring progress on these sales is measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date of the total estimated costs for each contract as materials are installed 
the percentage of completion method requires revenue recognition from the delivery of products to be deferred and the cost of such products to be capitalized as a deferred cost and current asset on the balance sheet 
we perform periodic evaluations of the progress of the installation of the solar pv systems using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to complete a project 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
we recognize revenue on product only sales of our lighting and energy management systems at the time of shipment 
for lighting and energy management systems projects consisting of multiple elements of revenue  such as a combination of product sales and services  we recognize revenue by allocating the total contract revenue to each element based on their relative selling prices 
we determine the selling price of each element based upon management s best estimate giving consideration to pricing practices  margin objectives  competition  scope and size of individual projects  geographies in which we offer our products and services and internal costs 
we recognize revenue at the time of product shipment on product sales and on services completed prior to product shipment 
we recognize revenue associated with services provided after product shipment  based on their relative selling price  when the services are completed and customer acceptance has been received 
when other significant obligations or acceptance terms remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled or acceptance by the customer has occurred 
our dependence on individual key customers can vary from period to period as a result of the significant size of some of our retrofit and multi facility roll out projects 
our top customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
no customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in any of fiscal  or to the extent that large retrofit and roll out projects and or large solar projects or solar roll outs become a greater component of our total revenue  we may experience more customer concentration in given periods 
the loss of  or substantial reduction in sales volume to  any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our total revenue in any given period and may result in significant annual and quarterly revenue variations 
our level of total revenue for any given period is dependent upon a number of factors  including i the demand for our products and systems  including our ota and ppa programs and any new products  applications and service that we may introduce through our engineered systems division  ii the number and timing of large retrofit and multi facility retrofit  or roll out  projects  iii the rate at which we expand our direct salesforce  iv our ability to realize revenue from our services  v market conditions  vi the level of our wholesale sales  vii our execution of our sales process  viii our ability to compete in a highly competitive market and our ability to respond successfully to market competition  ix the selling price of our products and services  x changes in capital investment levels by our customers and prospects  and xi customer sales and budget cycles 
as a result  our total revenue may be subject to quarterly variations and our total revenue for any particular fiscal quarter may not be indicative of future results 

table of contents contracted revenue 
although contracted revenue is not a term recognized under gaap  since the volume of our ota and solar business is expected to continue to increase and because our ota revenues are not recognized until project completion occurs and our solar contracts are recognized over a longer time period  we believe contracted revenue provides our management and investors with an informative measure of our relative order activity for any particular period 
we define contracted revenue as the total contractual value of all firm purchase orders received for our products and services and the discounted future cash flows expected  including all renewal periods  for all otas upon the execution of the contract and the discounted value of future potential revenue from energy generation over the life of all ppas along with the discounted value of revenue for renewable energy credits  or recs  for as long as the rec programs are currently defined to be in existence with the governing body 
for cash contracted revenue for sales of our hif lighting and energy management systems  we generally expect that we will begin to recognize gaap revenue within days from receipt of purchase order 
for cash contracted revenue for sales of our solar pv systems  we generally expect that we will begin to recognize gaap revenue within three to months  from receipt of purchase order 
for ota contracted revenue  we generally expect that we will begin to recognize gaap revenue under the terms of the agreements within days from the firm contract date 
for ppa contracted revenue  we generally expect that we will begin to recognize gaap revenue under the terms of the ppas within days from the firm contract date 
we believe that total contracted revenues are a key financial metric for evaluating and measuring our performance because the measure is an indicator of our success in our customers adoption and acceptance of our energy products and services as it measures firm contracted revenue value  regardless of the contract s cash or deferred financial structure and the related different gaap revenue recognition treatment 
in fiscal  total contracted revenue was million  an increase of compared to fiscal  which included million of expected potential gross cash flow streams associated with otas and million of potential discounted revenue streams from ppas 
in fiscal  total contracted revenue was million  an increase of compared to fiscal  which included million of discounted cash flow streams associated with otas and of potential discounted revenue streams from ppas 
in fiscal  total contracted revenue was million  a decrease of compared to fiscal  which included million of discounted cash flow streams associated with otas and of potential discounted revenue streams from ppas 
a reconciliation of our contracted revenues to our gaap revenues is as follows fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  total contracted revenues change in backlog solar pv change orders change in solar contracts ppa gaap revenue recognized other miscellaneous revenue gaap basis change in backlog reflects the increase or decrease in cash orders at the end of the respective period where product delivery or service performance has not yet occurred 
gaap revenue will be recognized when the performance conditions have been satisfied 
solar pv change orders reflects the decrease in contracted revenue related to customer change orders received for solar pv systems where the customer subsequently elected to purchase solar panels directly 
change in solar contracts reflects the decrease in contracted revenue related to customer contracts that were terminated due to a contingency concern or were expected to be sold to other integrators at a discounted rate 
other miscellaneous includes a reduction from ota contracted revenues measured at gross future cash flows and gaap revenue measured at the net present value of future cash flows for completed ota projects 
backlog 
we define backlog as the total contractual value of all firm orders and ota contracts received for our lighting products and services where delivery of product or completion of services has not yet occurred as of the end of any particular reporting period 
such orders must be evidenced by a signed proposal acceptance or purchase order from the customer 
our backlog does not include ppas or national contracts that have been negotiated  but under which we have not yet received a purchase order for the specific location 
as of march   we had a backlog of firm purchase orders of approximately million  which included million of solar pv orders 
as of march   we had a backlog of firm purchase orders of approximately million  which included million of solar pv orders 
as of march   we had a backlog of firm purchase orders of approximately million  which included million of solar pv orders 
we expect million of our million solar backlog as of march  to be converted into revenue during fiscal we generally expect this level of firm purchase order backlog related to hif lighting systems to be converted into revenue within the following quarter 
we generally expect our 
table of contents firm purchase order backlog related to solar pv systems to be recognized within the following three to months from the time construction of the system begins  although during fiscal  we received an million single order for which the solar pv system construction will not begin until our fiscal as a result of the decreased volume of our solar pv orders  the continued lengthening of our customer s purchasing decisions because of current recessed economic conditions and related factors  the continued shortening of our installation cycles and the number of projects sold through otas  a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenue recognized in future periods 
cost of revenue 
our total cost of revenue consists of costs for i raw materials  including sheet  coiled and specialty reflective aluminum  ii electrical components  including ballasts  power supplies and lamps  iii materials for sales of solar pv systems through our engineered systems division  including solar panels  inverters and wiring  iv wages and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  for our fabricating  coating  assembly  logistics and project installation service organizations  v manufacturing facilities  including depreciation on our manufacturing facilities and equipment  taxes  insurance and utilities  vi warranty expenses  vii installation and integration  and viii shipping and handling 
our cost of aluminum can be subject to commodity price fluctuations  which we attempt to mitigate through the recycling of old scrap fixtures through our facility which contain similar content of aluminum when compared to our new fixtures 
we also purchase many of our electrical components through forward purchase contracts 
we buy most of our specialty reflective aluminum from a single supplier  and a majority of our ballast and lamp components from a single supplier  although we believe we could obtain sufficient quantities of these raw materials and components on a price and quality competitive basis from other suppliers if necessary 
purchases from our current primary supplier of ballast and lamp components constituted  and of our total cost of revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our cost of revenue from ota projects is recorded upon customer acceptance and acknowledgement that the system is operating as specified 
our production labor force is non union and  as a result  our production labor costs have been relatively stable 
we have been expanding our network of qualified third party installers to realize efficiencies in the installation process 
during fiscal we reduced headcount and improved production product flow through reengineering of our assembly stations 
during fiscal  we reduced indirect headcount as part of our cost containment initiative 
gross margin 
our gross profit has been  and will continue to be  affected by the relative levels of our total revenue and our total cost of revenue  and as a result  our gross profit may be subject to quarterly variation 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue  or gross margin  is affected by a number of factors  including i our level of solar pv sales which have greater margin volatility due to recent decreases in product costs versus our traditional energy management systems  ii our mix of large retrofit and multi facility roll out projects with national accounts  iii the level of our wholesale and partner sales which generally have historically resulted in lower relative gross margins  but higher relative net margins  than our sales to direct customers  iv our realization rate on our billable services  v our project pricing  vi our level of warranty claims  vii our level of utilization of our manufacturing facilities and production equipment and related absorption of our manufacturing overhead costs  viii our level of efficiencies in our manufacturing operations  and ix our level of efficiencies from our subcontracted installation service providers 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of i general and administrative expenses  ii sales and marketing expenses  and iii research and development expenses 
personnel related costs are our largest operating expense 
in fiscal  we increased headcount in our sales areas for telemarketing and direct sales employees 
in fiscal  we decreased headcount as part of our cost containment initiatives 
in fiscal  we expect to increase headcount in our sales areas for direct sales employees 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and operations organizations  ii public company costs  including investor relations  external audit and internal audit  iii occupancy expenses  iv professional services fees  v technology related costs and amortization  vi asset impairment charges  and vii corporate related travel 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges related to our sales and marketing organization  ii internal and external sales commissions and bonuses  iii travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses associated with our selling efforts  iv marketing programs  v pre sales costs  vi bad debt and vii other related overhead 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  related to our engineering organization  ii payments to consultants  iii the design and development of new energy management products and enhancements to our existing energy management system  iv quality assurance and testing  and v other related overhead 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
in fiscal  our operating expenses increased as a result of investments in marketing efforts to our direct end customers and to our channel partners through increasing advertising  marketing collateral materials and participation in national industry and customer trade shows 
in fiscal  we invested in sales expansion initiatives  including the creation of a telemarketing call center for the purpose of customer lead generation  the establishment of a sales office and hiring of personnel in houston  texas 
table of contents and headcount additions to our retail sales force and our engineered systems division 
during the back half of fiscal  we initiated cost containment efforts that reduced expenses related to compensation  consulting and other discretionary spending 
we expense all pre sale costs incurred in connection with our sales process prior to obtaining a purchase order 
these pre sale costs may reduce our net income in a given period prior to recognizing any corresponding revenue 
we intend to continue to invest in the expansion of our in market direct sales force during fiscal we also intend to continue investing in our research and development of new and enhanced energy management products and services 
we recognize compensation expense for the fair value of our stock option awards and restricted stock awards granted over their related vesting period 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as a result of prior option and restricted stock grants  including awards in fiscal  we expect to recognize an additional million of stock based compensation over a weighted average period of approximately six years 
these charges have been  and will continue to be  allocated to cost of product revenue  general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses based on the departments in which the personnel receiving such awards have primary responsibility 
a substantial majority of these charges have been  and likely will continue to be  allocated to general and administrative expenses and sales and marketing expenses 
interest expense 
our interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding borrowings under long term debt obligations  including the amortization of previously incurred financing costs 
we amortize deferred financing costs to interest expense over the life of the related debt instrument  ranging from two to ten years 
loss or gain on sale of receivable 
our loss or gain on sale of receivables consists of losses or gains associated with sales of receivables from ota contracts to a third party and the discounted value of the long term payments associated with such sale 
dividend and interest income 
we report interest income earned from our financed ota contracts and on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
for fiscal and fiscal  our interest income increased as a result of the increasing ota finance contracts completed that we retained ownership of the contracts and the related interest charged to customers 
for fiscal  our interest income declined slightly as we began to decrease the number of ota finance contracts where we retained the ownership of the contract 
instead  we elected to utilize our third party equipment finance providers directly and we recorded no interest income on those transactions 
income taxes 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
included in these loss carryforwards were million for federal and million for state tax purposes of compensation expenses that were associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
the benefit from our net operating losses created from these compensation expenses has not yet been recognized in our financial statements and will be accounted for in our shareholders equity as a credit to additional paid in capital as the deduction reduces our income taxes payable 
we also had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and state tax credits of million as of march  a valuation allowance has been set up to fully reserve for our net operating losses and our tax credits 
it is possible that we may not be able to utilize the full benefit of our state tax credits due to our state apportioned income and the potential expiration of the state tax credits due to the carry forward period 
these federal and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards are available  subject to the discussion in the following paragraph  to offset future taxable income and  if not utilized  will begin to expire in varying amounts between our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is based upon our cumulative three year operating losses 
generally  a change of more than in the ownership of a company s stock  by value  over a three year period constitutes an ownership change for federal income tax purposes 
an ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change 
in fiscal and prior to our ipo  past issuances and transfers of stock caused an ownership change for certain tax purposes 
when certain ownership changes occur  tax laws require that a calculation be made to establish a limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards created in periods prior to such ownership change 
there was no limitation that occurred for fiscal  fiscal or fiscal we do not believe that this change will impact our overall ability to use our full remaining net operating loss carryforwards during the time period that they are available to us 
results of operations the following table sets forth the line items of our consolidated statements of operations on an absolute dollar basis and as a relative percentage of our total revenue for each applicable period  together with the relative percentage change in such line item between applicable comparable periods set forth below

product revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in product revenue was due to a decrease of million from our sales of solar photovoltaic  or pv  systems 
during fiscal  we constructed several large solar pv systems and completed fewer projects of similar size during fiscal additionally  material prices have fallen related to solar panels and materials during the last months 
product revenue from energy efficiency projects decreased by million  predominantly occurring during our fiscal first half on reduced direct market sales 
service revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in service revenue was due to an increase of million from the related installation services resulting from solar pv systems installed during fiscal as mentioned above  as solar panel prices have declined  service revenue has become a higher percentage of the total revenue contracted from a solar pv project 
our service revenue from sales of our hif energy efficiency systems increased million as a result of the decrease in wholesale revenue from efficiency project sales 
we believe that our hif energy efficiency business continues to be challenged by a difficult capital spending environment 
cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of product revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
cost of service revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
total gross margin increased from for fiscal to for fiscal for fiscal  our gross margin percentage increased due to improved project margins from sales of solar pv systems and to cost containment initiatives in our manufacturing operations during the back half of fiscal our gross margin on renewable revenues was during fiscal compared to during fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage was due to negotiated contract cost reductions and efficiencies in our project management and contracted expenses 
gross margin from our hif integrated systems revenue for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the decrease in hif gross margin percentage was due to the decrease in hif revenue occurring during the fiscal first half and the impact of our fixed manufacturing costs 
operating expenses 
table of contents general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase for fiscal was due to expenses of million resulting from our reorganization initiatives  increased legal expenses related to unusual items of million  increased compensation expenses of million related to our second half of fiscal bonus plan and increased audit expenses of million related to the re audit of our fiscal financial statements 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by headcount reductions and discretionary spending reductions that occurred during the second half of fiscal sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due to the full year impact incurred during the first half of fiscal of headcount additions from our prior year investment into the formation and staffing of our telemarketing function  the establishment and staffing of our houston technology center  headcount additions for sales and project management to support the increase in our solar pv backlog and headcount additions for in market efficiency sales 
we reduced headcount in the back half of fiscal as part of our cost reduction initiatives 
additional increases were due to commission expense from solar projects of million  increased depreciation of million due to investments in information systems  increased severance expense of million due to headcount reductions and a million increase in bad debt versus the prior year 
research and development 
our research and development expenses decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was due to decreased consulting expenses and reduced development and product testing costs related to our energy management controls initiatives 
interest expense 
our interest expense increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase in our interest expense was due to the full year impact of additional debt funding completed during fiscal for the purpose of financing our ota projects 
gain on sale of receivables 
our gain from the sale of receivables from our ota contracts decreased from  for fiscal to for fiscal due to the establishment of multiple financing arrangements for otas during fiscal and  in future periods  we do not expect to sell ota contracts at levels similar to fiscal or fiscal interest income 
our interest income was relatively unchanged from fiscal to fiscal in the future  we expect our interest income to decrease as we continue to utilize third party finance providers for our ota projects 
income taxes 
our income tax expense increased from million for fiscal to income tax expense of million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
during fiscal  we recorded a valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets in the amount of million due to uncertainty over the realization value of these assets in the future 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was  compared to for fiscal the change in effective rate was due primarily to the impact of the valuation reserve 
contracted revenue 
total contracted revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
we attribute this decrease in contracted revenue to a decrease in orders for renewable technologies through our engineered systems division 
this decrease was due to a difficult environment in fiscal due to volatility in pricing of solar materials  uncertainty over the viability of certain suppliers in the solar industry  a decline in pricing for renewable energy credits generated from solar pv systems and the expiration of certain cash tax benefits provided through calendar year fiscal compared to fiscal revenue 
product revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in product revenue was due to an increase of million from our sales of solar photovoltaic  or pv  systems 
service revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in service revenue was due to the related installation services resulting from the increased sales of pv systems during fiscal our service revenue from sales of our hif energy efficiency systems decreased as a result of the increased percentage of total revenue to our wholesale channels where services are not provided 
we believe that our hif energy efficiency business continues to be challenged by a difficult capital spending environment 
cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of product revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
cost of service revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
total gross margins declined from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in total gross margin in fiscal was due to the higher mix of renewables revenue which have lower gross margins than sales of our hif energy management systems 
gross margins from the sale of our solar pv systems were for fiscal gross margins from the sale of our hif energy management systems were for fiscal the negative impact from the product mix shift was partially offset by cost containment efforts through improved production efficiencies resulting from the reengineering of our assembly process and reductions in discretionary spending 
operating expenses 
table of contents general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was a result of million in reduced legal expenses and a million reduction in compensation costs and other discretionary spending  offset by an increase in depreciation of million resulting from the new erp system put into service at the beginning of fiscal year sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was a result of our investment into the formation and staffing of our telemarketing function  the establishment and staffing of a houston technology center  headcount additions for retail sales and in sales and project management to support the increase in our solar pv revenue during fiscal research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in expenses for fiscal was due to increased spending on the development of new product offerings  including our led product and energy management controls initiatives 
interest expense 
our interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense for fiscal was due to the full year impact of additional debt funding completed during fiscal and additional debt funding completed during fiscal for the purpose of financing our ota projects 
gain loss on sale of receivables 
our loss from the sale of receivables from our ota contracts decreased from million for fiscal to a gain from the sale of receivables of  for fiscal due to the establishment of multiple financing arrangements for otas during fiscal and  in future periods  we do not expect to sell ota contracts at significant losses similar to fiscal interest income 
our interest income increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
interest income earned from customer financed programs was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest income related to investments in fiscal was million and increased slightly from the prior year as a result of higher cash balances 
income taxes 
our income taxes increased from a benefit of million for fiscal year to income tax expense of million for fiscal our effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was a benefit rate of  compared to an income tax rate of for the fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we converted almost all of our existing incentive stock options  or isos  to non qualified stock options  or nqsos 
this conversion was applied retrospectively allowing us to benefit from million of income tax expense related to non deductible iso stock compensation expense that was previously deferred for income tax purposes 
the conversion reduced our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to a benefit rate of from a pre conversion income tax expense rate of 
the conversion of isos to nqsos greatly reduced the effective tax rate volatility that we have historically experienced at nominal pre tax earnings levels 
the change in tax rate versus the prior fiscal year is due to the difference between taxable losses during fiscal and the related impact of the non deductible stock compensation expense and taxable income during fiscal  along with the impact of federal credits available to us 
contracted revenue 
total contracted revenue increased from million for fiscal which included million of future potential revenue streams associated with ppas to million for fiscal which included of future potential revenue streams associated with ppas  an increase of million  or 
we attribute this improvement in contracted revenue to an increase in orders for renewable technologies through our engineered systems division

quarterly results of operations the following tables present our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the last eight fiscal quarters in the period ended march  i on an absolute dollar basis in thousands and ii as a percentage of total revenue for the applicable fiscal quarter 
you should read the following tables in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this form k 
in our opinion  the unaudited financial information presented below has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements  and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our operating results for the fiscal quarters presented 
operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future fiscal quarters or for a full fiscal year

historically  our energy management customers have tended to increase their purchases near the beginning or end of their capital budget cycles  which tend to correspond to the beginning or end of the calendar year 
as a result  we have in the past experienced lower relative total revenue in our fiscal first and second quarters and higher relative total revenue in our fiscal third quarter 
our more recent engineered systems solar revenues have resulted in higher total revenue during our fiscal second and third quarters due to construction seasons and system installation progress occurring during those periods 
we expect that there may be future variations in our quarterly total revenue depending on our level of national account roll out projects  acquisitions  wholesale sales and the size and geographic locations of our pv solar systems projects 
our results for any particular fiscal quarter may not be indicative of results for other fiscal quarters or an entire fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources overview 
table of contents we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  our cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts and bank certificates of deposits with maturities of less than days and an average yield of 
our short term investment account consists of a bank certificate of deposit in the amount of million with an expiration date of june and a yield of 
our decrease in cash during fiscal was primarily due to our repurchase of common stock in the amount of million and our capital spending of million 
in october  we halted our common share repurchase program and our capital spending has declined significantly as a result of our strategic refocus 
we believe these activities have stabilized our previously declining cash balance 
in may  we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire harris 
the purchase price for the acquisition is approximately million  subject to up to an additional million payable in unregistered shares of our common stock upon the achievement of certain revenue milestones in calendar year and or we expect to close the harris acquisition during our fiscal second quarter 
upon closing  the purchase price will be paid in a combination of million in cash  a million unsecured promissory note and the issuance of million in shares of our common stock 
we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our closing obligations and to fund harris expected near term working capital requirements 
during fiscal  we funded million for our investment in company owned equipment under our ppa projects 
we do not expect to use our own cash in the future to fund ppa project opportunities and are investigating financing options with third parties to fund future solar projects 
during fiscal  we entered into an arrangement with a national equipment finance company to provide immediate non recourse funding of pre credit approved ota finance contracts upon project completion and customer acceptance 
additionally  we completed a million ota line of credit with immediate availability for the purpose of funding ota projects upon the project completion and customer acceptance  for which we choose to hold the contracts internally 
we have multiple funding sources for our ota projects 
during fiscal  of our total completed otas were financed by the purchase directly with third party equipment finance companies 
in the future  we do not intend to fund ota contracts through debt borrowings 
in fiscal  we completed two separate debt financing transactions with a regional bank to provide funding for a pool of individual ota contracts that we hold the contracts for 
we believe that having multiple funding sources for our internally held ota contracts  as well as having multiple external sources to purchase the ota contracts out right  has greatly reduced the cash strain created by funding these contracts ourselves and is no longer an impediment to our ability to increase the number of ota contracts we complete in the future 
the return to a recessionary state of the global economy could potentially have negative effects on our near term liquidity and capital resources  including slower collections of receivables  delays of existing order deliveries and postponements of incoming orders 
however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  our anticipated cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next months 
as a result of the million in cash and cash equivalents as of march   we do not anticipate drawing on our revolving line of credit nor do we expect to use significant amounts of our cash balances for operating activities during fiscal other than in connection with our potential acquisition of harris 
our future working capital requirements thereafter will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue  our rate of ota growth and our ability to maintain external funding for our ota contracts  our rate of investment into our financed sales programs  our introduction of new products and services and enhancements to our existing energy management system  the timing and extent of expansions of our sales force and other administrative and production personnel  the timing and extent of advertising and promotional campaigns  and our research and development activities 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for our fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended march  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows related to operating activities 
cash used in operating activities primarily consist of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expenses  income taxes and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash provided from operating activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million and a net loss adjusted for non cash expense items of million 
cash provided 
table of contents by changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted of a decrease of million in inventory on decreased purchases of lighting components  predominantly fluorescent lamps and ballasts  a decrease in accounts receivable of million on increased collections  an increase in accrued expenses of million due to the timing of reorganization expenses  accrued bonus expenses and increased accrued legal expenses  and a decrease in prepaid and other assets of million for unbilled revenue related to solar projects where construction progress is billed to the customer at the beginning of the month following the month in which the work was performed 
cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities included a million decrease in accounts payable due to payments during the second half of fiscal resulting from the settlement of vendor disputes and a decrease in deferred revenue of million due to the timing of advanced billings and the achievement of performance criteria for revenue recognition 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net cash of million provided from changes in working capital and net income adjusted non cash expenses of million 
cash provided by working capital improvements was primarily due to the completion of contracts and a reduction in deferred project costs  improved collections of our accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable related to payment terms on inventory purchases during the fiscal fourth quarter 
these benefits were partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue related to project completions and an increase in inventory for purchases described in the section below 
cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net cash of million used for working capital purposes offset by net income adjusted for non cash expense items of million 
cash used for working capital consisted of an increase of million in accounts receivable due to the increase in revenue and advanced customer billings  an million increase in deferred contract costs for material and service expenses incurred for in process projects and a million increase in inventory for purchases of ballast components and wireless controls inventories 
cash provided by working capital included a million increase in deferred revenue for advanced customer billings and a million increase in accounts payable related to payment terms on inventory purchases during the fiscal fourth quarter 
cash flows related to investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we invested million for capital improvements related to our product development  information technology systems  manufacturing improvements and facility investments and million for investment in patent activities 
in fiscal  we invested million for capital improvements related to our information systems  facilities  renewables and manufacturing improvements and million for patent investments 
in fiscal  we invested a net million in equipment related to our ppa finance programs  million for capital improvements related to our information technology systems  renewable technologies  manufacturing and tooling improvements and facility investments and million for patent investments 
cash flows related to financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal this included million used for repurchases of shares of our common stock and million for repayment of long term debt 
in october  we halted our common stock repurchase program 
cash flows provided by financing activities included million in new short term debt borrowings to fund equipment lease buyouts  million received from stock option exercises and shareholder note repayments and million for excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal this included million in new debt borrowings to fund ota projects  million received from stock option and warrant exercises  million for excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and million from the collection of shareholder notes 
cash flows used in financing activities included million for repayment of long term debt  million used for common share repurchases and million for costs related to our new ota credit agreement 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal this included million in new debt borrowings to fund ota and capital projects and million received from stock option and warrant exercises 
cash flows used in financing activities included million for repayment of long term debt  million for excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and million for costs related to the credit agreement 
working capital our net working capital as of march  was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
our net working capital as of march  was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
our current accounts receivables decreased from our prior fiscal year end by million as a result of increased collections 
our net collection terms for solar pv sales are typically net days or less versus our day collection terms for sales of our hif lighting and energy management systems 
our current inventories decreased from our fiscal year end by million due to a decrease in the level of lighting component inventories 
during fiscal  we had increased our inventories of fluorescent lamps by million due to concerns over shortages of rare earth minerals used in the production of fluorescent lamps 
we believe that these supply shortage concerns have stabilized and during the back half of fiscal we have reduced our safety stock levels of these components to prior levels 

table of contents during fiscal  we increased our inventory levels of key electronic components  specifically electronic ballasts  to avoid potential shortages and customer service issues as a result of lengthening supply lead times and product availability issues 
we continue to monitor supply side concerns within the electronic components market and the fluorescent lamp market and believe that our current inventory levels are sufficient to protect us against the risk of being unable to deliver product as specified by our customers requirements 
we are continually monitoring supply side concerns through conversations with our key vendors and currently believe that supply availability concerns appear to have subsided 
in the future  we intend to continue to reduce inventories  specifically our wireless controls product inventories 
we generally attempt to maintain at least a three month supply of on hand inventory of purchased components and raw materials to meet anticipated demand  as well as to reduce our risk of unexpected raw material or component shortages or supply interruptions 
our accounts receivables  inventory and payables may increase to the extent our revenue and order levels increase 
indebtedness on june   we entered into a credit agreement  which we refer to herein as the credit agreement  with jp morgan chase bank  na  whom we refer to herein as jp morgan 
the credit agreement replaced our former credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility  which we refer to herein as the credit facility  that matures on june  we are currently working with jp morgan on a renewal of the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are limited to i million or ii during periods in which the outstanding principal balance of outstanding loans under the credit facility is greater than million  the lesser of a million or b the sum of of the outstanding principal balance of certain accounts receivable and of certain inventory 
we also may cause jp morgan to issue letters of credit for our account in the aggregate principal amount of up to million  with the dollar amount of each issued letter of credit counting against the overall limit on borrowings under the credit facility 
as of march   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  primarily for securing collateral requirements under equipment operating leases 
in february  we completed an amendment to the credit agreement making certain changes to the financial covenants  which are described below 
the credit agreement  as amended  requires us to maintain i a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth not to exceed to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter  ii average daily unencumbered liquidity of at least million during each period of three consecutive business days and iii ebitda of at least million during each fiscal quarter 
the credit agreement also contains certain restrictions on our ability to make capital or lease expenditures over prescribed limits  incur additional indebtedness  consolidate or merge  guarantee obligations of third parties  make loans or advances  declare or pay any dividend or distribution on our stock  redeem or repurchase shares of our stock or pledge assets 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of march  and we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the credit agreement  as amended  as of march  the credit agreement is secured by a first lien security interest in our accounts receivable  inventory and general intangibles  and a second lien priority in our equipment and fixtures 
all otas  ppas  leases  supply agreements and or similar agreements relating to solar photovoltaic and wind turbine systems or facilities  as well as all of our accounts receivable and assets related to the foregoing  are excluded from these liens 
we must pay a fee of on the average daily unused amount of the credit facility and a fee of on the daily average face amount of undrawn issued letters of credit 
the fee on unused amounts is waived if we or our affiliates maintain funds on deposit with jp morgan or its affiliates above a specified amount 
we did not meet the deposit requirement to waive the unused fee as of march  in addition to our credit facility  we also have other existing long term indebtedness and obligations under various debt instruments  including pursuant to a bank term note  a bank first mortgage  a debenture to a community development organization  a federal block grant loan  two city industrial revolving loans  three notes for funding ota contracts and a credit facility for the sole purpose of funding ota contracts 
as of march   the total amount of principal outstanding on these various obligations was million 
these obligations have varying maturity dates between and and bear interest at annual rates of between and 
the weighted average annual interest rate of such obligations as of march  was 
based on interest rates in effect as of march   we expect that our total debt service payments on such obligations for fiscal  including scheduled principal  lease and interest payments  but excluding any repayment of borrowings on the credit facility  will approximate million 
all of these obligations are subject to security interests on our assets 
several of these obligations have covenants  such as customary financial and restrictive covenants  including maintenance of a minimum debt service coverage ratio  a minimum current ratio  quarterly rolling net income requirement  limitations on executive compensation and advances  limits on capital expenditures per year  limits on distributions  and restrictions on our ability to make loans  advances  extensions of credit  investments  capital contributions  incur additional indebtedness  create liens  guaranty obligations  merge or consolidate or undergo a change in control 
as of march   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
capital spending 
table of contents over the past three fiscal years  we have made capital expenditures primarily for general corporate purposes for our corporate headquarters and technology center  production equipment and tooling and for information technology systems 
our capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we plan to incur approximately million to million in capital expenditures in fiscal our capital spending plans predominantly consist of investments related to the potential integration of acquisitions  investments in our manufacturing operations to improve efficiencies and reduce costs and for investment in information technology systems 
we expect to finance these capital expenditures primarily through our existing cash  equipment secured loans and leases  to the extent needed  long term debt financing  or by using our available capacity under our credit facility 
contractual obligations information regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below as of march  is set forth in the following table payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands bank debt obligations cash interest payments on debt operating lease obligations purchase order and capital expenditure commitments total reflects non cancellable purchase commitments in the amount of million for certain inventory items entered into in order to secure better pricing and ensure materials on hand 
the table of contractual obligations and commitments does not include our unrecognized tax benefits which were million at march  we have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of any adjustments to these unrecognized benefits 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation our results from operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we re evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  the collectability of receivables  stock based compensation  warranty reserves and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable and no further obligation exists  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue is recognized when products are shipped to a customer or when services are completed and acceptance provisions  if any  have been met 
in certain of our contracts  we provide multiple deliverables 
we record the revenue associated with each element of these arrangements by allocating the total contract revenue to each element based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe of selling price  if available  third party evidence  or tpe of selling price if vsoe is not available  and best estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we determine the selling price for our hif lighting and energy management system products  installation and recycling services and for solar renewable product and services using management s best estimate of selling price as vsoe or tpe evidence does not exist 
we consider external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  
table of contents margin objectives  competition  geographies in which we offer our products and services  internal costs  and the scope and size of projects 
our ppa contracts are supply side agreements for the generation of electricity for which we recognize revenue on a monthly basis over the life of the ppa contract  typically in excess of years 
for sales of our solar pv systems  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method by measuring project progress by the percentage of costs incurred to date of the total estimated costs for each contract as materials are installed 
revenue from sales of our solar pv systems is generally recognized over a period of three to months 
additionally  we offer our ota sales type financing program under which we finance the customer s purchase of our energy management systems 
our ota contracts are sales type capital leases under gaap and we record revenue at the net present value of the future payments at the time customer acceptance of the installed and operating system is complete 
our ota contracts under this sales type financing are either structured with a fixed term  typically months  and a bargain purchase option at the end of term  or are one year in duration and  at the completion of the initial one year term  provide for i one to four automatic one year renewals at agreed upon pricing  ii an early buyout for cash  or iii the return of the equipment at the customer s expense 
the revenue that we are entitled to receive from the sale of our lighting fixtures under our ota financing program is fixed and is based on the cost of the lighting fixtures and applicable profit margin 
our revenue from agreements entered into under this program is not dependent upon our customers actual energy savings 
upon completion of the installation  we may choose to sell the future cash flows and residual rights to the equipment on a non recourse basis to an unrelated third party finance company in exchange for cash and future payments 
deferred revenue or deferred costs are recorded for project sales consisting of multiple elements or performance milestones  where the criteria for revenue recognition has not been met 
the majority of our deferred revenue relates to advance customer billings for solar pv projects or to prepaid services to be provided at determined future dates 
as of march  and  our deferred revenue was million and million  respectively 
deferred costs on product are recorded as a current or long term asset dependent upon when the project completion is expected to occur 
as of march  and  our deferred costs were million and million  respectively 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and include raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
items are removed from inventory using the first in  first out method 
work in process inventories are comprised of raw materials that have been converted into components for final assembly 
inventory amounts include the cost to manufacture the item  such as the cost of raw materials and related freight  labor and other applied overhead costs 
we review our inventory for obsolescence and marketability 
if the estimated market value  which is based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  falls below cost  then the inventory value is reduced to its market value 
our inventory obsolescence reserves at march  and were million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments and estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of the underlying receivables  our historical experience with write offs and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  and we believe appropriate reserves have been established  we may not adequately predict future credit losses 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required which would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at march  and march   respectively 
investments 
our accounting and disclosures for short term investments are in accordance with the requirements of the fair value measurements and disclosure  financial instrument  and investments debt and security topics of the fasb accounting standards codification 
the fair value measurements and disclosure topic defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
gaap describes a fair value hierarchy based on the following three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 

table of contents as of march  and  our financial assets were measured at fair value employing level inputs 
stock based compensation 
we have historically issued stock options to our employees  executive officers and directors 
we adopted the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
compensation costs for options granted are recognized in earnings  net of estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the fair value of each option for financial reporting purposes was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants fiscal year ended march  weighted average expected term years years years risk free interest rate expected volatility expected forfeiture rate the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  including fair value  expected term  risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividends  and expected forfeiture rate to calculate the fair value of stock based payment awards 
we estimated the expected term of our stock options based on the vesting term of our options and expected exercise behavior 
our risk free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on united states treasury zero coupon issues as of the option grant date with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the option 
we determined volatility based upon the historical market price of our common share price 
as required by our stock and incentive awards plan  since the closing of our ipo in december  we have solely used the closing sale price of our common shares on the nyse mkt or the nasdaq global market on the date of grant to establish the exercise price of our stock options 
we recognized stock based compensation expense under asc of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal as of march   million of total total stock based compensation cost was expected to be recognized by us over a weighted average period of years 
we expect to recognize million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal based on our stock options outstanding as of march  this expense will increase further to the extent we have granted  or will grant  additional stock options in the future 
common stock warrants 
as of march   warrants were outstanding to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at weighted average exercise prices of per share 
these warrants were valued using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions i contractual terms of five years  ii weighted average risk free interest rates of to  iii expected volatility ranging between and  and iv dividend yields of 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expenses  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in our statements of operations 
our judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
for fiscal  we determined that a valuation allowance against our net state deferred tax assets was necessary in the amount of  due to our state apportioned income and the potential expiration of state tax credits due to the carryforward periods 
for fiscal  we determined that a full valuation allowance against our net federal and our net state deferred tax assets was necessary in the amount of million due to our cumulative three year taxable losses 
in making these determinations  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  recent financial performance and ownership changes 
we believe that past issuances and transfers of our stock caused an ownership change in fiscal that affected the timing of the use of our net operating loss carryforwards  but we do not believe the ownership change affects the use of the full amount of the net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period 
table of contents prior to such ownership change to offset taxable income will be subject to limitations in a particular year  which could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
included in these loss carryforwards were million for federal and million for state tax expenses that were associated with the exercise of non qualified stock options 
the benefit from our net operating losses created from these compensation expenses has not yet been recognized in our financial statements and will be accounted for in our shareholders equity as a credit to additional paid in capital as the deduction reduces our income taxes payable 
we first recognize tax benefits from current period stock option expenses against current period income 
the remaining current period income is offset by net operating losses under the tax law ordering approach 
under this approach  we will utilize the net operating losses from stock option expenses last 
we also had federal tax credit carryforwards of and state tax credit carryforwards of  which are fully reserved for as part of our valuation allowance 
both the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in varying amounts between and we recognize penalties and interest related to uncertain tax liabilities in income tax expense 
penalties and interest were immaterial as of the date of adoption and are included in unrecognized tax benefits 
due to the existence of net operating loss and credit carryforwards  all years since are open to examination by tax authorities 
by their nature  tax laws are often subject to interpretation 
further complicating matters is that in those cases where a tax position is open to interpretation  differences of opinion can result in differing conclusions as to the amount of tax benefits to be recognized under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes 
asc utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
consequently  the level of evidence and documentation necessary to support a position prior to being given recognition and measurement within the financial statements is a matter of judgment that depends on all available evidence 
as of march   the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately million  all of which would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized 
we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  which could result in gains or losses that could be material 
recent accounting pronouncements see note b summary of significant accounting policies to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss related to changes in market prices  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing that may adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation 
our results from operations have not historically been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
foreign exchange risk 
we face minimal exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our foreign currency losses for all reporting periods have been nominal 
interest rate risk 
our investments consist primarily of investments in money market funds and certificate of deposits 
while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we do not believe that we are subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments 
as a result  we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure 
as of march   million of our million of outstanding debt was at floating interest rates 
an increase of in the prime rate would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately  per year 
commodity price risk 
we are exposed to certain commodity price risks associated with our purchases of raw materials  most significantly our aluminum purchases 
we have currently locked pricing for our specialty reflective aluminum requirements through the end of calendar year a hypothetical fluctuation in aluminum prices would have an impact of million on earnings in fiscal additionally  we recycle legacy hid fixtures and recover the salvaged scrap value which we believe provides a raw materials cost hedge as commodity prices change 
credit risk 
credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of our customers to meet their contractual agreements 
our financing program  the orion throughput agreement  or ota  is an installment based payment plan 
table of contents for our customers 
this financing program subjects us to credit risk as poor credit decisions or customer defaults could result in increases to our allowances for doubtful accounts and or write offs of accounts receivable and could have material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
in fiscal and fiscal  we entered into debt agreements for the purpose of funding certain ota contracts where we maintain ownership of the contracts 
we did not enter into any debt agreements during fiscal for the purpose of financing ota contracts 
we currently utilize third party equipment finance companies for the purpose of funding ota projects and expect to continue to do so in the future
