item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should read item a 
risk factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
our fiscal year ends on june  and references to a specific fiscal year are the twelve months ended june of such year for example  fiscal refers to the year ended june  
business overview we are a leading global provider of mission critical process optimization software solutions which are designed to manage and optimize plant and process design  operational performance  and supply chain planning 
our aspenone software and related services have been developed specifically for companies in the process industries  including the energy  chemicals  and engineering and construction industries 
customers use our solutions to improve their competitiveness and profitability by increasing throughput and productivity  reducing operating costs  enhancing capital efficiency  and decreasing working capital requirements 
our software incorporates our proprietary empirical models of manufacturing and planning processes and reflects the deep domain expertise we have amassed from focusing on solutions for the process industries for over years 
we have developed our applications to design and optimize processes across three principal business areas engineering  manufacturing and supply chain 
we are a recognized market and technology leader in providing process optimization software for each of these business areas 
we have established sustainable competitive advantages within our industry based on the following strengths innovative products that can enhance our customers profitability  long term customer relationships  large installed base of users of our software  and long term license contracts with historically high renewal rates 
we have more than  customers globally 
our customers in the process industries include energy  chemicals  engineering and construction  as well as consumer packaged goods  power  metals and mining  pulp and paper  pharmaceuticals and biofuels 
we primarily license our software products through a subscription offering which we refer to as our aspenone licensing model 
our aspenone products are organized into two suites engineering and manufacturing and supply chain  or msc 
the aspenone licensing model provides customers with access to all of the products within the aspenone suite s they license 
customers can change or alternate the use of multiple products in a licensed suite through the use of exchangeable units of measurement  called tokens  licensed in quantities determined by the customer 
this licensing system enables customers to use products as needed and to experiment with different products to best solve whatever critical business challenges they face 
customers can increase their usage of our software by purchasing additional tokens as business needs evolve 
we believe easier access to all of the aspenone products will lead to increased software usage and higher revenue over time 

table of contents transition to the aspenone licensing model prior to fiscal  we offered term or perpetual licenses to specific products  or specifically defined sets of products  which we refer to as point products 
the majority of our license revenue was recognized under an upfront revenue model  in which the net present value of the aggregate license fees was recognized as revenue upon shipment of the point products  provided all revenue recognition criteria were met 
customers typically received one year of post contract software maintenance and support  or sms  with their license agreements and then could elect to renew sms annually 
revenue from sms was recognized ratably over the period in which the sms was delivered 
in fiscal  we introduced the following changes to our licensing model i we began offering our software on a subscription basis allowing our customers access to all products within a licensed suite aspenone engineering or aspenone manufacturing and supply chain 
sms is included for the entire term of the arrangement and customers are entitled to any software products or updates introduced into the licensed suite 
we refer to this license arrangement as our aspenone licensing model 
ii we began to include sms for the entire term on our point product term arrangements 
revenue related to our aspenone licensing model is recognized over the term of the arrangement on a ratable basis 
during fiscal and  license revenue related to our point product arrangements with sms included for the entire term of the arrangement was generally recognized on the due date of each annual installment  provided all revenue recognition criteria were met 
beginning in fiscal  with the introduction of our premier plus sms offering  we were unable to establish evidence of the fair value for the sms component and revenue from these arrangements is now recognized on a ratable basis 
the changes to our licensing model introduced in fiscal did not change the method or timing of customer billings or cash collections 
since the introduction of these changes  our net cash provided by operating activities has increased in each annual period from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during these periods we have realized steadily improving cash flow due to growth of our portfolio of term license contracts  as well as from the renewal of customer contracts  on an installment basis  that were previously paid upfront 
as of june   a significant percentage of our active license agreements has been transitioned to our aspenone licensing model 
in the foreseeable future  we anticipate that a significant portion of our remaining legacy term license arrangements will transition to the aspenone licensing model as existing license agreements reach the end of their respective original terms 
during this transition period  we may continue to have arrangements where the software element will be recognized upfront  including perpetual licenses  amendments to existing legacy term arrangements  and in limited cases  renewals of existing legacy term arrangements 
however  we do not expect revenue related to these sources to be significant in relation to our total revenue 
impact of licensing model changes the principal accounting implications of the changes to our licensing model in fiscal are as follows prior to fiscal  the majority of our license revenue was recognized on an upfront basis 
since the upfront model resulted in the net present value of multiple years of future installments being recognized at the time of shipment  the changes to our licensing model resulted in a significant reduction in our software license revenue for fiscal  and as compared to the fiscal years preceding our licensing model changes 
these changes did not impact the 
table of contents incurrence or timing of our expenses  and there was no corresponding expense reduction to offset the lower revenue  resulting in operating losses for fiscal  and the transition will not be complete until the remaining term license agreements executed under our upfront revenue model reach the end of their original term 
many of our license arrangements were five or six years in duration when the aspenone licensing model was introduced at the start of fiscal  and consequently  a number of agreements executed under the upfront revenue model will not reach the end of their original term until fiscal the sms component of our services and other revenue has decreased  and been offset by a corresponding increase in subscription and software revenue as customers have transitioned to our aspenone licensing model 
under our aspenone licensing model and for point product arrangements with premier plus sms included for the full contract term  the entire arrangement fee  including the sms component  is included within subscription and software revenue 
the sms component of our services and other revenue is expected to continue to decrease until the total portfolio of active license arrangements have been converted to arrangements which include sms for the full contract term 
installment payments from aspenone agreements and from point product arrangements with sms included for the contract term are not considered fixed or determinable  and as a result  are not included in installments receivable 
accordingly  our installments receivable balance has  and is expected to continue to  decrease as licenses previously executed under our upfront revenue model reach the end of their terms 
the amount of our deferred revenue has increased  and is expected to continue to increase  as more revenue from our term license portfolio is recognized on a ratable basis 
introduction of our premier plus sms offering beginning in fiscal  we introduced our premier plus sms offering to provide more value to our customers 
as part of this offering  customers receive x support  faster response times  dedicated technical advocates and access to web based training modules 
the premier plus sms offering is only provided to customers that commit to sms for the entire term of the arrangement 
our annually renewable legacy sms offering continues to be available to customers with legacy term and perpetual license agreements 
the introduction of our premier plus sms offering in fiscal resulted in a change to the revenue recognition of point product arrangements that include premier plus sms for the term of the arrangement 
since we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for our premier plus sms offering  the sms element of our point product arrangements is not separable  resulting in revenue being recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  once the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
prior to fiscal  license revenue was recognized on the due date of each annual installment  provided all revenue recognition criteria were met 
the introduction of our premier plus sms offering did not change the revenue recognition for our aspenone licensing arrangements 
revenue we generate revenue primarily from the following sources software licenses 
we provide integrated process optimization software solutions designed specifically for the process industries 
we license our software products  together with sms  primarily on a term basis  and we offer extended payment options for our term license agreements that generally require annual payments  which we also refer to as installments 

table of contents sms and training 
our sms business consists primarily of providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and updates 
we provide customer technical support services throughout the world from our customer support centers as well as via email and through our support website 
our training business provides customers with a variety of training solutions  including on site  internet based and customized training 
professional services 
we offer professional services that are focused on implementing our technology in order to improve customers plant performance and gain better operational data 
customers who use our professional services typically engage us to provide those services over periods of up to months 
we charge customers for professional services on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
four basic criteria must be satisfied before software license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between us and an end user  delivery of our product has occurred  the fee for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement we use a signed contract as evidence of an arrangement for software licenses and sms 
for professional services we use a signed contract and a work proposal to evidence an arrangement 
in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order are required by the customer  we consider both taken together as evidence of the arrangement 
delivery of our product software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers via disk media with standard shipping terms of free carrier  our warehouse ie  fca  named place 
our software license agreements do not contain conditions for acceptance 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement 
significant judgment is involved in making this assessment 
under our upfront revenue model  we are able to demonstrate that the fees are fixed or determinable for all arrangements  including those for our term licenses that contain extended payment terms 
we have an established history of collecting under the terms of these contracts without providing concessions to customers 
in addition  we also assess whether a contract modification to an existing term arrangement constitutes a concession 
in making this assessment  significant analysis is performed to ensure that no concessions are given 
our software license agreements do not include a right of return or exchange 
for license arrangements executed under the upfront revenue model  we recognize license revenue upon delivery of the software product  provided all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
we cannot assert that the fees under our aspenone licensing model and point product arrangements with premier plus sms are fixed or determinable because the rights provided to customers  and the economics of the arrangements  are not comparable to our transactions with other customers under the upfront revenue model 
as a result  the amount of revenue recognized for these arrangements is limited by the amount of customer payments that become due 
collection of fee is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer payment history  its current creditworthiness  economic conditions in the customer industry and geographic location  and general economic conditions 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value we have established vsoe for certain sms offerings  professional services  and training  but not for our software products or our premier plus sms offering 
we assess vsoe for sms  professional services  and training based on an analysis of standalone sales of these offerings using the bell shaped 
table of contents curve approach 
we do not have a history of selling our premier plus sms offering to customers on a standalone basis  and as a result are unable to establish vsoe for this new deliverable 
we allocate the arrangement consideration among the elements included in our multi element arrangements using the residual method 
under the residual method  the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee for perpetual and term licenses is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the software  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if vsoe does not exist for an undelivered element in an arrangement  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
under the upfront revenue model  the residual license fee is recognized upon delivery of the software provided all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
arrangements that qualify for upfront recognition include sales of perpetual licenses  amendments to existing legacy term arrangements and renewals of legacy term arrangements 
subscription and software revenue subscription and software revenue consists of product and related revenue from our i aspenone licensing model  including sms  ii point product arrangements with our premier plus sms offering included for the contract term  iii legacy arrangements including a amendments to existing legacy term arrangements  b renewals of legacy term arrangements and c legacy arrangements that are being recognized over time as a result of not previously meeting one or more of the requirements for recognition under the upfront revenue model  and iv perpetual arrangements 
when a customer elects to license our products under our aspenone licensing model  our premier plus sms offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives  for the term of the arrangement  the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenone software suite 
due to our obligation to provide unspecified future software products and updates  we are required to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement  once the other revenue recognition criteria noted above have been met 
our point product arrangements with premier plus sms include sms for the term of the arrangement 
since we do not have vsoe for our premier plus sms offering  the sms element of our point product arrangements is not separable 
as a result  revenue associated with point product arrangements with premier plus sms included for the contract term is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  once the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
perpetual license and legacy arrangements do not include the same rights as those provided to customers under the aspenone licensing model and point product arrangements with premier plus sms 
we continue to have vsoe for the legacy sms offering provided in support of these license arrangements and can therefore separate the undelivered elements 
accordingly  the license fees for perpetual licenses and legacy arrangements continue to be recognized upon delivery of the software products using the residual method  provided all other revenue recognition requirements have been met 
services and other sms revenue sms revenue includes the maintenance revenue recognized from arrangements for which we continue to have vsoe for the undelivered sms offering legacy sms offering 
for arrangements sold with our legacy sms offering  sms renewals are at the option of the customer  and the fair value of sms is deferred and subsequently amortized over the contractual term of the sms arrangement 
for arrangements executed under the aspenone licensing model and beginning in fiscal for point product arrangements with premier plus sms  we have not established vsoe for the sms 
table of contents deliverable 
as a result  the revenue related to the sms element of these transactions is reported in subscription and software revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to fiscal  the revenue related to the sms deliverable of our point product arrangements  for which we had vsoe  was reported in services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we expect legacy sms revenue to continue to decrease as additional customers transition to our aspenone licensing model 
beginning in fiscal  we expect that sms revenue will represent less than of our total revenue  at which time we will include legacy sms revenue in the subscription and software line in our consolidated statements of operations 
professional services revenue professional services are provided to customers on a time and materials  or t m  or fixed price basis 
we recognize professional services fees for our t m contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates 
revenue from fixed price engagements is recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs 
project costs are typically expensed as incurred 
the use of the proportional performance method is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the costs to complete a project 
we use historical experience as a basis for future estimates to complete current projects 
additionally  we believe that costs are the best available measure of performance 
out of pocket expenses which are reimbursed by customers are recorded as revenue 
in certain circumstances  professional services revenue may be recognized over a longer time period than that which the services are performed 
if the costs to complete a project are not estimable or the completion is uncertain  the revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
in circumstances in which professional services are sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new aspenone license or point product arrangement with premier plus sms  revenue is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of i the period the services are performed  or ii the license term 
when we provide professional services considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize the combined revenue from the sale of the software and related services using the completed contract or percentage of completion method 
we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  which resulted in losses on those contracts 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
key components of operations revenue subscription and software revenue consists of product and related revenue from the following sources i aspenone licensing model  including sms  ii point product arrangements with our premier plus sms offering included for the contract term referred to as point product arrangements with premier plus sms  iii legacy arrangements including a amendments to existing legacy term arrangements  b renewals of legacy term arrangements and c legacy arrangements that are being recognized over time as a result of not previously meeting one or more of the requirements for recognition under the upfront revenue model  and iv perpetual arrangements 

table of contents results of operations classification subscription and software revenue prior to fiscal  subscription and software revenue were each classified separately on our consolidated statements of operations  because each type of revenue had different revenue recognition characteristics  and the amount of revenue attributable to each was material in relation to our total revenue 
additionally  we were able to separate the residual amount of software revenue related to the software component of our point product arrangements which included sms for the contract term  based on the vsoe for the sms element 
as a result of the introduction of our premier plus sms offering in the first quarter of fiscal  the majority of our product related revenue is now recognized on a ratable basis  over the term of the arrangement 
since the distinction between subscription and point product ratable revenue does not represent a meaningful difference from either a line of business or revenue recognition perspective  we have combined our subscription and software revenue into a single line item on consolidated statements of operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the following table summarizes the changes to our revenue classifications and the timing of revenue recognition of subscription and software revenue for fiscal and compared to fiscal ratable revenue refers to product revenue that is recognized evenly over the term of the related agreement  beginning when the first payment becomes due 
the residual method refers to the recognition of the difference between the total arrangement fee and the undiscounted vsoe for the undelivered element  assuming all other revenue recognition requirements have been met 
revenue recognition methodology revenue classification in income statement fiscal and fiscal and fiscal fiscal type of revenue aspenone subscription subscription and software subscription ratable ratable point products software subscription and software software ratable residual method bundled sms subscription and software services and other ratable ratable other legacy arrangements subscription and software software residual method residual method perpetual arrangements subscription and software software residual method residual method services and other revenue 
our services and other revenue consists primarily of revenue related to professional services  standalone renewals of our legacy sms offering and training 
the amount and timing of this revenue depend on a number of factors  including whether the professional services arrangement was sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new aspenone licensing arrangement  the number  value and rate per hour of service transactions booked during the current and preceding periods  the number and availability of service resources actively engaged on billable projects  the timing of milestone acceptance for engagements contractually requiring customer sign off  the timing of negotiating and signing maintenance renewals  the timing of collection of cash payments when collectability is uncertain  and the size of the installed base of license contracts 

table of contents we expect legacy sms revenue to continue to decrease as additional customers transition to our aspenone licensing model 
beginning in fiscal  we expect that sms revenue will represent less than of our total revenue  at which time we will include legacy sms revenue in the subscription and software line in our consolidated statements of operations 
cost of revenue cost of subscription and software 
our cost of subscription and software revenue consists of royalties  amortization of capitalized software and purchased technology intangibles  distribution fees  the costs of providing sms on arrangements where the related revenue is recorded as subscription and software revenue  and costs related to delivery of software 
cost of services and other 
our cost of services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel related and external consultant costs associated with providing customers professional services  sms on arrangements for which we have vsoe for the sms element  and training 
as additional customers transition to our aspenone licensing model  the cost of sms revenue continues to migrate from cost of services and other revenue to cost of subscription and software revenue 
beginning with fiscal  we expect the majority of the costs of our sms business to be presented in cost of subscription and software revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
operating expenses selling and marketing expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel and travel expenses related to the effort expended to license our products and services to current and potential customers  as well as for overall management of customer relationships 
marketing expenses include expenses needed to promote our company and our products and to acquire market research to help us better understand our customers and their business needs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses related to the creation of new products and to enhancements and engineering changes to existing products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate and support functions  such as executive leadership and administration groups  finance  legal  human resources and corporate communications  and other costs such as outside professional and consultant fees and provision for bad debts 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges result from the closure or consolidation of our facilities  or from qualifying reductions in headcount 
other income and expenses interest income 
interest income is recorded for the accretion of interest on the installment payments of our term software license contracts when revenue is recognized upfront at net present value  and from the investment in marketable securities and short term money market instruments 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of charges primarily related to our secured borrowings 
secured borrowings are derived from our borrowing arrangements with unrelated financial institutions 
other expense income  net 
other expense income  net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange losses gains generated from the settlement and remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units 

table of contents provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is comprised of domestic and foreign taxes 
the benefit from income taxes is comprised of the deferred benefit for tax deductions and credits that we expect to utilize in the future 
we record interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
we expect the amount of income tax expense to vary each reporting period depending upon fluctuations in our taxable income by jurisdiction 
key business metrics background the changes to our licensing model in fiscal resulted in a significant reduction in our product related revenue for fiscal  and as compared to the fiscal years preceding our licensing model changes 
since the upfront model resulted in the net present value of multiple years of future installments being recognized at the time of shipment  we do not expect to recognize levels of revenue reflective of the value of our active license agreements until the remaining term license agreements executed under our upfront revenue model i reach the end of their original terms and ii are renewed 
as a result  we believe that  a number of our performance indicators based on us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  including revenue  gross profit  operating income loss and net income loss  are of limited value in assessing our performance  growth and financial condition 
accordingly  in addition to these gaap based performance indicators  we also focus on certain non gaap and other business metrics  including the key metrics set forth below  to track our business performance as we continue our transition to the aspenone licensing model 
none of these metrics should be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
we use a non gaap measure of free cash flow to analyze cash flows generated from our operations 
management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals 
we believe this measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives and it is also useful as a basis for comparing our performance with that of our competitors 
to supplement our presentation of total cost of revenue and total operating costs presented on a gaap basis  we use a non gaap measure of adjusted total costs  which excludes certain non cash and non recurring expenses 
management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it approximates the cash operating costs of the business 
the presentation of these non gaap measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to total cost of revenue and total operating costs as a measure of our total costs 
total term contract value total term contract value  or tcv  is an estimate of the renewal value  as of a specific date  of our active portfolio of term license agreements 
tcv is calculated by multiplying the terminal annual payment for each active term license agreement by the original length of the existing license term  and then aggregating this amount for all active term license agreements 
accordingly  tcv represents the full renewal value of all of our current term license agreements under the hypothetical assumption that all of those agreements are simultaneously renewed for the identical license terms and at the same terminal annual payment amounts 
tcv includes the value of sms for any multi year license agreements for which sms is committed for the entire license term 
tcv does not include any amounts for perpetual licenses  professional services  training or standalone renewal sms 
tcv is calculated using constant currency assumptions for agreements denominated in currencies other than us dollars in order to remove the impact of currency fluctuations between comparison dates 

table of contents we also estimate a license only tcv  which we refer to as tlcv  by removing the sms portion of tcv using our historic estimated selling price for sms 
our portfolio of active license agreements currently reflects a mix of a license agreements that include sms for the entire license term and b legacy license agreements that do not include sms 
tlcv provides a consistent basis for assessing growth  particularly while customers are continuing to transition to arrangements that include sms for the term of the arrangement 
we believe tcv and tlcv are useful metrics for analyzing our business performance  particularly while we are transitioning to our aspenone licensing model or to point product arrangements with premier plus sms included for the full term  and revenue comparisons between fiscal periods do not reflect the actual growth rate of our business 
comparing tcv and tlcv for different dates provides insight into the growth and retention rate of our business during the period between those dates 
tcv and tlcv increase as the result of new term license agreements with new or existing customers  renewals or modifications of existing license agreements that result in higher license fees due to price escalation or an increase in the number of tokens units of software usage or products licensed  and renewals of existing license agreements that increase the length of the license term 
the renewal of an existing license agreement will not increase tcv and tlcv unless the renewal results in higher license fees or a longer license term 
tcv and tlcv are adversely affected by customer non renewals and by renewals that result in lower license fees or a shorter license term 
our standard license term historically has been between five and six years  and we do not expect this standard term to change in the future 
many of our contracts have escalating annual payments throughout the term of the arrangement 
by calculating tcv and tlcv based on the terminal year annual payment  we are typically using the highest annual fee from the existing arrangement to calculate the hypothetical renewal value of our portfolio of term arrangements 
we estimate that tlcv grew by approximately during fiscal  from billion at june  to billion at june  we estimate that tcv grew by approximately during fiscal  from billion at june  to billion at june  the growth was attributable primarily to an increase in the number of tokens sold 
annual spend annual spend is a derivative metric that is closely related to tcv 
tcv is an estimate of the full renewal value of our active portfolio of term license agreements  as of a specific date 
annual spend is an estimate of the annualized value of our active portfolio of term agreements  as of a specific date 
annual spend is calculated by taking the most recent annual invoice value of each of our active term contracts and then aggregating this amount for all active term licenses 
annual spend also includes the annualized value of standalone sms agreements purchased in conjunction with term license agreements 
we believe that the annual spend metric may be helpful to investors attempting to analyze and model subscription and software revenue while we transition to our aspenone licensing model 
comparing annual spend for different dates provides insight into the growth and retention rates of our business  and since annual spend represents the estimated annualized billings associated with our active term license agreements  it provides insight into a normalized value for subscription and software revenue 
annual spend increases as a result of new term license agreements with new or existing customers  
table of contents renewals or modifications of existing license agreements that result in higher license fees due to price escalation or an increase in the number of tokens units of software usage or products licensed  escalation of annual payments in our active term contracts 
annual spend is adversely affected by term license and standalone sms agreements that are not renewed 
unlike tcv and tlcv  the value of annual spend is not impacted by changes to contract duration 
we estimate that annual spend grew by approximately during fiscal  from million at june  to million at june  the growth was attributable primarily to an increase in the number of tokens sold 
adjusted total costs the following table presents our total cost of revenue and total operating expenses  as adjusted for stock based compensation expense  restructuring charges  and amortization of purchased intangibles  for the indicated periods year ended june  compared to compared to dollars in thousands total cost of revenue total operating expenses total expenses less stock based compensation restructuring charges amortization of purchased technology intangibles adjusted total costs non gaap not meaningful fiscal compared to fiscal total expenses decreased by million during fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
adjusted total costs  which consist of total cost of revenue and total operating expenses  adjusted to exclude stock based compensation  restructuring charges and amortization of purchased technology intangibles  decreased by million for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the period over period decrease in adjusted total costs was primarily attributable to a reduction in legal costs of million  lower compensation and related costs of million and lower third party commissions of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in marketing costs of million and other less significant items that totaled million  net 
in addition  fiscal benefited from the recognition of a million gain associated with an insurance recovery  which resulted in a reduction in expense during the period 
no similar events occurred in fiscal stock based compensation expense increased million primarily due to the incremental expense associated with the august annual program grant  which had a higher valuation than awards granted in previous periods 
amortization of purchased technology intangibles increased million 
table of contents associated with the assets acquired during fiscal and the second half of fiscal please refer to the results of operations section below for additional information on year over year expense fluctuations 
fiscal compared to fiscal total expenses increased by million during fiscal compared to fiscal adjusted total costs  which consist of total cost of revenue and total operating expenses  adjusted to exclude stock based compensation  restructuring charges and amortization of purchased technology intangibles  increased by million for fiscal compared to fiscal the period over period increase in adjusted total costs was primarily attributable to higher compensation and related costs of million  an increase in business taxes of million  and other less significant increases which in the aggregate totaled million 
these increases were offset by a reduction in legal costs of million  lower spending on outside consultants of million  the recognition of a million gain associated with an insurance recovery  lower audit fees of million  lower recruiting and related costs of million  and other less significant reductions which in the aggregate totaled million 
in addition  the fiscal period benefited from the reversal of a previously accrued liability of million resulting from the expiration of a technology vendor relationship  as well as from the collection of previously reserved receivables resulting in a net reduction in bad debt expense of million 
these two events resulted in a reduction in expense during the period 
no similar events occurred in fiscal stock based compensation expense increased million primarily due to the incremental expense associated with the august annual program grant  which had a higher valuation than the prior year annual grant  partially offset by a decrease attributable to certain awards becoming fully vested 
please refer to the results of operations section below for additional information on year over year expense fluctuations 
free cash flow free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the net impact of a purchases of property  equipment and leasehold improvements b insurance proceeds and c capitalized computer software development costs 
customer collections and  consequently  cash flows from operating activities and free cash flow are primarily driven by license and services billings  rather than recognized revenue 
as a result  the introduction of our aspenone licensing model has not had an adverse impact on cash receipts 
until existing term license contracts are renewed and license related revenue returns to prior year levels  we believe free cash flow is a more relevant measure of our financial performance than income statement profitability measures such as total revenue  gross profit  operating income loss and net income loss 
additionally  we also believe that free cash flow is often used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of software companies 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the periods presented year ended june  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities purchase of property  equipment  and leasehold improvements insurance proceeds capitalized computer software development costs free cash flow non gaap total free cash flow increased million during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we have realized steadily improving free cash flow due to growth of our portfolio of term license contracts as well as from the renewal of customer contracts on an installment basis that were previously paid upfront 
over the past few years we have reduced the incentive for customers to pay upfront by reducing the discount rate used to calculate the upfront payment 
we expect our free cash flow to continue to improve as our portfolio of term license contracts continues to grow

also  during fiscal  we deferred million of professional services revenue accounted for under the completed contract method compared to million of revenue on such arrangements during the prior fiscal year 
under the aspenone licensing model  revenue from committed professional service arrangements that are sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new aspenone licensing transaction is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of a the period the services are performed or b the term of the related software arrangement 
as our typical contract term approximates five years  professional services revenue on these types of arrangements will usually be recognized over a longer period than the period over which the services are performed 
during fiscal  we had net revenue deferrals of million for professional services bundled with aspenone transactions 
by comparison  we had net revenue deferrals of million on similar arrangements during the prior fiscal year 
fiscal compared to fiscal the year over year decrease in professional services revenue was primarily due to decreased customer demand for professional services and to the timing of revenue recognition on certain large arrangements 
our primary focus is the successful implementation and usage of our software  and in many instances  this work can be professionally performed by qualified third parties 
we often compete with third party consulting firms when bidding for professional services contracts  particularly in developed markets 
the competitive market for services  in conjunction with increasing customer familiarity with many of our well established software products  had an unfavorable impact on our professional services revenue during fiscal

sms and other revenue sms and other revenue includes revenue from annually renewed legacy sms  offered in support of our perpetual and legacy term arrangements

critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes  and loss contingencies 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition four basic criteria must be satisfied before software license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between us and an end user  delivery of our product has occurred  the fee for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement we use a signed contract as evidence of an arrangement for software licenses and sms 
for professional services we use a signed contract and a work proposal to evidence an arrangement 
in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order are required by the customer  we consider both taken together as evidence of the arrangement 
delivery of our product software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers via disk media with standard shipping terms of free carrier  our warehouse ie  fca  named place 
our software license agreements do not contain conditions for acceptance 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement 
significant judgment is involved in making this assessment 
under our upfront revenue model  we are able to demonstrate that the fees are fixed or determinable for all arrangements  including those for our term licenses that contain extended payment terms 
we have an established history of collecting under the terms of these contracts without providing concessions to customers 
in addition  we also assess whether a contract modification to an existing term arrangement constitutes a concession 
in making this assessment  significant analysis is performed to ensure that no concessions are given 
our software license agreements do not include a right of return or exchange 
for license arrangements executed under the upfront revenue model  we recognize 
table of contents license revenue upon delivery of the software product  provided all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
we cannot assert that the fees under our aspenone licensing model and point product arrangements with premier plus sms are fixed or determinable because the rights provided to customers  and the economics of the arrangements  are not comparable to our transactions with other customers under the upfront revenue model 
as a result  the amount of revenue recognized for these arrangements is limited by the amount of customer payments that become due 
collection of fee is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer payment history  its current creditworthiness  economic conditions in the customer industry and geographic location  and general economic conditions 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value we have established vsoe for certain sms offerings  professional services  and training  but not for our software products or our premier plus sms offering 
we assess vsoe for sms  professional services  and training  based on an analysis of standalone sales of the offerings using the bell shaped curve approach 
we do not have a history of selling our premier plus sms offering to customers on a standalone basis  and as a result are unable to establish vsoe for this new deliverable 
we allocate the arrangement consideration among the elements included in our multi element arrangements using the residual method 
under the residual method  the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee for perpetual and term licenses is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the software  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if vsoe does not exist for an undelivered element in an arrangement  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
under the upfront revenue model  the residual license fee is recognized upon delivery of the software provided all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
arrangements that qualify for upfront recognition include sales of perpetual licenses  amendments to existing legacy term arrangements and renewals of legacy term arrangements 
subscription and software revenue subscription and software revenue consists of product and related revenue from our i aspenone licensing model  including sms  ii point product arrangements with our premier plus sms offering included for the contract term  iii legacy arrangements including a amendments to existing legacy term arrangements  b renewals of legacy term arrangements and c legacy arrangements that are being recognized over time as a result of not previously meeting one or more of the requirements for recognition under the upfront revenue model  and iv perpetual arrangements 
when a customer elects to license our products under our aspenone licensing model  our premier plus sms offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives  for the term of the arrangement  the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenone software suite 
due to our obligation to provide unspecified future software products and updates  we are required to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the arrangement  once the other revenue recognition criteria noted above have been met 
our point product arrangements with premier plus sms include sms for the term of the arrangement 
since we do not have vsoe for our premier plus sms offering  the sms element of our point product arrangements is not separable 
as a result  revenue associated with point product 
table of contents arrangements with premier plus sms included for the contract term is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  once the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
perpetual license and legacy arrangements do not include the same rights as those provided to customers under the aspenone licensing model and point product arrangements with premier plus sms 
we continue to have vsoe for the legacy sms offering provided in support of these license arrangements and can therefore separate the undelivered elements 
accordingly  the license fees for perpetual licenses and legacy arrangements continue to be recognized upon delivery of the software products using the residual method  provided all other revenue recognition requirements have been met 
services and other sms revenue sms revenue includes the maintenance revenue recognized from arrangements for which we continue to have vsoe for the undelivered sms offering legacy sms offering 
for arrangements sold with our legacy sms offering  sms renewals are at the option of the customer  and the fair value of sms is deferred and subsequently amortized over the contractual term of the sms arrangement 
for arrangements executed under the aspenone licensing model and beginning in fiscal for point product arrangements with premier plus sms  we have not established vsoe for the sms deliverable 
as a result  the revenue related to the sms element of these transactions is reported in subscription and software revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to fiscal  the revenue related to the sms deliverable of our point product arrangements  for which we had vsoe  was reported in services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we expect legacy sms revenue to continue to decrease as additional customers transition to our aspenone licensing model 
beginning in fiscal  we expect that sms revenue will represent less than of our total revenue  at which time we will include legacy sms revenue in the subscription and software line in our consolidated statements of operations 
professional services revenue professional services are provided to customers on a time and materials t m or fixed price basis 
we recognize professional services fees for our t m contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates 
revenue from fixed price engagements is recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs 
project costs are typically expensed as incurred 
the use of the proportional performance method is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the costs to complete a project 
we use historical experience as a basis for future estimates to complete current projects 
additionally  we believe that costs are the best available measure of performance 
out of pocket expenses which are reimbursed by customers are recorded as revenue 
in certain circumstances  professional services revenue may be recognized over a longer time period than that which the services are performed 
if the costs to complete a project are not estimable or the completion is uncertain  the revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
in circumstances in which professional services are sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new aspenone license or point product arrangement with premier plus sms  revenue is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of i the period the services are performed  or ii the license term 
when we provide professional services considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize the combined revenue from the sale of the software and related services using the completed contract or percentage of completion method 

table of contents we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  which resulted in losses on those contracts 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and statutes that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets can result from unused operating losses  research and development r d and foreign tax credit carryforwards and deductions recorded for financial statement purposes prior to them being deductible on a tax return 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences 
valuation allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we consider  among other available information  projected future taxable income  limitations on the availability of net operating loss nols and tax credit carryforwards  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and other evidence assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets 
adjustments to the valuation allowance are included in the provision for benefit from income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations in the period they become known or can be estimated 
a significant portion of our us valuation allowance was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based on the current forecast  we expect that we will utilize all of our us federal nols  foreign tax credits  and r d credits by fiscal  based on a with and without approach 
we have retained a full valuation allowance in the us for the deferred tax asset related to capital losses 
we also have a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiary nol carryforwards 
our provision for benefit from income taxes includes amounts determined under the provisions of fin  uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no  currently included as provisions of asc  and is intended to satisfy additional income tax assessments  including interest and penalties  that could result from any tax return positions for which the likelihood of sustaining the position on an audit does not meet a threshold of more likely than not 
penalties and interest are recorded as a component of our provision for benefit from income taxes 
tax liabilities under fin were recorded as a component of our income taxes payable and other non current liabilities 
the ultimate amount of taxes due will not be known until examinations are completed and settled or the audit periods are closed by statutes 
our us and foreign tax returns are subject to periodic compliance examinations by various local and national tax authorities through periods defined by the tax code in applicable jurisdictions 
the years prior to are closed in the united states  although the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits generated in earlier periods will keep these periods open for examination 
similarly  the years prior to are closed in the united kingdom  although the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards generated in earlier periods will keep the periods open for examination 
our canadian subsidiaries are subject to audit from forward  and certain other of our international subsidiaries are subject to audit from forward 
in connection with examinations of tax filings  tax contingencies can arise from differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations relative to the amount  timing or proper inclusion or exclusion of revenue and expenses in taxable income or loss 
for periods that remain subject to audit  we have asserted and unasserted potential assessments that are subject to final tax settlements 

table of contents loss contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
we accrue estimated liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation and other sources when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the claim  assessment or damages can be reasonably estimated
