item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited financial statements and related notes which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements included in this discussion as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview we are a medical device company developing innovative technologies for cardiac and coronary disease 
the company s primary product  the c pulse heart assist system the c pulse system  is an implantable  non blood contacting  heart assist therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe heart failure  which can be implanted using a minimally invasive procedure 
the c pulse system is designed to relieve the symptoms of heart failure through the use of counter pulsation technology by enabling an increase in cardiac output  an increase in coronary blood flow  and a reduction in the heart s pumping load 
we are in the process of pursuing regulatory approvals necessary to sell our system in the united states 
we completed enrollment of our north american feasibility clinical trial in the first half of in november  we announced the preliminary results of the six month follow up period for the feasibility study and we submitted the clinical data to the fda 
in march  the fda notified us that it completed its review of the c pulse system feasibility trial data  concluded we met the applicable agency requirements  and indicated that we can move forward with an investigational device exemption application 
in november  the fda provided us with unconditional approval to initiate a pivotal trial 
we currently anticipate that enrollment of our pivotal trial will begin during the first half of we obtained ce mark approval for the c pulse system in july and have taken initial steps to evaluate the market potential for our system in targeted countries that accept the ce mark in anticipation of commencing commercial sales 
in order to gain additional clinical data and support reimbursement in europe  we also expect to initiate a post market trial in europe that will evaluate endpoints similar to those for our us pivotal trial 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of a customer arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties  iii collectability is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred  which is when product title transfers to the customer  or services have been rendered 
sales are not conditional based on customer acceptance provisions or installation obligations 
our c pulse system is not approved for commercial sale in the united states 
we currently have no revenue  but we anticipate that any revenue we generate will consist solely of sales of the c pulse system to hospitals and clinics pursuant to research arrangements and with appropriate regulatory approvals for sales in conjunction with our clinical trials 
for clinical trial implant revenue  the product title generally transfers on the date the system is implanted 
we do not charge hospitals and clinics for shipping 
we expect to expense shipping costs at the time we report the related revenue and record these costs in cost of sales 
foreign currency translation and transactions foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date 
results of operations are translated using the average rates prevailing during the reporting period 
our australian subsidiary s functional currency is the australian dollar 
translation adjustments result from translating the subsidiary s financial statements into our reporting currency  the us dollar 
the translation adjustment has not been included in determining our net loss  but has been reported separately and is accumulated in a separate component of equity 
effective january   we concluded that the functional currency of our us based parent company is the us dollar 
we have concluded that the functional currency of the australian subsidiary remains the australian dollar 
stock based compensation we recognize all share based payments  including grants of stock options in the income statement as an operating expense based on their fair value over the requisite service period 
we compute the estimated fair values of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
no tax benefit has been recorded due to the full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that we have recorded 
stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
equity instruments issued to non employees  and for services and goods  are shares of our common stock  warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock 
these shares  warrants or options are either fully vested and exercisable at the date of grant or vest over a certain period during which services are provided 
we expense the fair market value of these securities over the period in which the related services are received 

table of contents going concern our financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming we continue as a going concern 
during the years ended december  and  we incurred losses from operations and net cash outflows from operating activities as disclosed in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  respectively 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital based on the achievement of existing milestones as and when required 
our directors  after due consideration  believe that we will be able to raise new equity capital as required to fund our business plan 
should our future efforts to raise capital not be successful  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
furthermore  our ability to continue as a going concern is subject to our ability to develop and successfully commercialize our c pulse system being developed 
if we are unable to obtain such funding of an amount and on a timeline necessary to meet our future operational plans  or to successfully commercialize our intellectual property  we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
no adjustments have been made relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we not continue as a going concern 
accounting standards applicable to emerging growth companies we qualify as an emerging growth company pursuant to the provisions of the jobs act  enacted on april  section b of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section a b of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards 
an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies 
we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period  and as a result of this election  our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for new or revised accounting standards for us public companies 
internal controls and procedures our independent registered public accounting firm is not yet required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  and will not be required to do so for as long as we are an emerging growth company pursuant to the provisions of the jobs act 
recent events stock purchase agreement on january   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with aspire capital fund  llc 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  aspire capital has committed to purchase up to million of share purchases 
in consideration for entering into the purchase agreement  concurrent with the execution of the purchase agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to aspire capital for no consideration 
on february   the related s registration statement for the issuance of up to million shares under the purchase agreement went effective 
on february   we issued  shares at to aspire capital for net proceeds of million pursuant to the purchase agreement 
asx delisting on february   we received conditional approval from the asx to delist from the official list of the asx 
the delisting will be effective upon the close of trading on may  financial overview we are an early stage medical device company focused on developing  manufacturing and commercializing our c pulse system for treatment of class iii and ambulatory class iv heart failure 
our activities since inception have consisted principally of raising capital  performing research and development and conducting preclinical and clinical trials 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
to date  we have been funded by private and public equity financings 
although we believe that we will be able to successfully fund our operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will ever operate profitably 

table of contents results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease change n a sales of the c pulse system to hospitals and clinics under contract in conjunction with our north american fda clinical trials historically have generated all of our revenue 
we did not have any sales of our c pulse system device in or  as we completed enrollment in our feasibility trial in early and have not yet commenced enrollment in our pivotal clinical trial 
we expect our revenue will be minimal until we begin enrolling patients in our north american pivotal clinical trial and initiate trials in select countries in europe under our ce mark  both expected to commence in the first half of research and development expense year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease change our decrease in research and development expense for as compared to the prior year was primarily caused by the completion of our feasibility trial enrollment in and the reduction of related support costs  as well as the completion of certain development activities related to our c pulse system in the prior year 
we expect our research and development expense will increase in from as we add personnel to support our us pivotal clinical trial 
selling  general and administrative expense year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease change our increase in selling  general and administrative expense in as compared to the prior year was primarily caused by increased stock based compensation expense resulting from stock option grants in the second half of as well as in  and increased professional fees and personnel additions beginning in as we developed our infrastructure and prepared for our nasdaq listing  completed in february  and in preparation for european trials expected to commence in the first half of interest income year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease change our decrease in interest income in compared to the prior year was primarily caused by lower interest rates earned on cash balances maintained in the united states  where the majority of our cash was held in the current year period  compared to rates earned on cash balances maintained in australia  where a large portion of our cash was held during income tax benefit year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease change our income tax benefit in resulted from a  research and development tax credit in australia for the tax year ended june  and the balance from a research and development credit in the state of minnesota for the tax year ended december  our tax income benefit for the year ended december  resulted from a research and development credit in the state of minnesota for our tax year ended june  we have not completed the tax return for our australian subsidiary for the year ended june  and cannot be sure that the research and development expenditures of our subsidiary during that period will result in a tax refund 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have funded our operations primarily through a series of equity issuances  including the issuance of common shares for net proceeds of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively 
we believe  based on our current operating plan  that the net proceeds from the sale of stock to aspire capital  if completed in its entirety  and our cash balances and cash generated from our clinical trials will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months  but that we will require additional funding to complete our pivotal trial 
from time to time we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or enter into credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity  debt  or convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt  convertible debt or enter into credit facilities  these securities and debt holders could have rights senior to those of our common stock  and this debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and would require us to use cash for debt service rather than our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
although we have successfully financed our operations through the issuance of common stock and warrants to date  any such required additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million in each of the years ended december  and the net cash used in each of these periods primarily reflects the net loss for those periods  offset in part by depreciation  amortization of warrants issued for services  stock based compensation and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of cash used in investing activities in and was for leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment associated with the relocation of our headquarters 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants 
capital resource requirements as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements
