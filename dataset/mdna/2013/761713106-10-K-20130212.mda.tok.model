rai s management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against rjr tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees  or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against american snuff co  when viewed on an individual basis  is not probable or estimable  as described in litigation affecting the cigarette industry overview in item  note to consolidated financial statements 
rai and its subsidiaries believe that they have valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously 
nonetheless  the possibility of material losses related to tobacco litigation is more than remote 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against rjr tobacco  american snuff co 
or their affiliates or indemnitees  or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss 
moreover  notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters  it is possible that rai s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters or difficulties in obtaining the bonds required to stay execution of judgments on appeal

the risks below are not the only ones that could impact rai and its subsidiaries 
additional risks not currently known or currently considered immaterial also could affect rai s business 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in connection with other information included in this annual report on form k 
adverse litigation outcomes could have a negative impact on rai s ability to continue to operate due to their impact on cash flows 
additionally  rai s operating subsidiaries could be subject to substantial liabilities and bonding difficulties from litigation related to cigarette products or smokeless tobacco products  thereby reducing operating margins and cash flows from operations 
rjr tobacco  american snuff co 
and their affiliates  including rai  and indemnitees  including b w  have been named in a large number of tobacco related legal actions  proceedings or claims 
the claimants seek recovery on a variety of legal theories  including negligence  strict liability in tort  design defect  fraud  misrepresentation  unfair trade practices and violations of state and federal antitrust laws 
various forms of relief are sought  including compensatory and  where available  punitive damages in amounts ranging in some cases into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars 
the tobacco related legal actions range from individual lawsuits to class actions and other aggregate claim lawsuits 
in particular  class action suits have been filed in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers  including rjr tobacco  and their parents  including rai  alleging that the use of the terms lights and ultra lights constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices 
in  the us supreme court ruled that neither the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act nor the federal trade commission s regulation of tar and nicotine disclosures preempts or bars such claims 
this ruling limits certain defenses available to rjr tobacco and other cigarette manufacturers and has led to the filing of additional lawsuits 
in the event rjr tobacco and its affiliates and indemnitees lose one or more of the pending lights class action suits  rjr tobacco  depending upon the amount of any damages ordered  could face difficulties in obtaining the bond required to stay execution of the judgment

victories by plaintiffs in highly publicized cases against rjr tobacco and other tobacco companies regarding the health effects of smoking may stimulate further claims 
a material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs 
in addition  adverse outcomes in pending cases could have adverse effects on the ability of rjr tobacco and its indemnitees  including b w  to prevail in other smoking and health litigation 
for a more complete description of the above cases and other significant litigation involving rai and its operating subsidiaries  including rjr tobacco and american snuff co  see litigation affecting the cigarette industry and smokeless tobacco litigation in item  note to consolidated financial statements 
the verdict and order in the case brought by the us department of justice  while not final  could subject rjr tobacco to significant compliance costs  which could negatively impact the results of operations  cash flows and the financial position of rjr tobacco and  consequently  of rai 
in  the us department of justice brought an action against rjr tobacco  b w and other tobacco companies 
the government sought  in addition to other remedies  pursuant to the civil provisions of the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act  referred to as rico  disgorgement of profits in an amount of approximately billion  the government contends have been earned as a consequence of a rico racketeering enterprise 
in  the court found certain defendants  including rjr tobacco  liable for the rico claims  but did not impose any direct financial penalties 
instead  the court  among other things  enjoined the defendants from committing future racketeering acts  participating in certain trade organizations  making misrepresentations concerning smoking and health and youth marketing  and using certain brand descriptors such as low tar  light  ultra light  mild and natural  and ordered the defendants to issue corrective communications on five subjects  including smoking and health  and addiction 
both sides appealed 
in  the court of appeals affirmed in part the trial court s order and remanded for further proceedings 
both sides petitions for writ of certiorari from the us supreme court were denied in june  including the doj s request for review of the district court s denial of the government s request for disgorgement of profits and certain other remedies 
in november  the trial court specified the text of the corrective statements that it has ordered the defendants to disseminate 
the court ordered the parties to enter mediation on a number of issues related to the implementation of the corrective statements remedy 
that mediation is scheduled to conclude by march  further proceedings are pending before the trial court to determine whether those corrective statements will have to be displayed at retail points of sale 
if the corrective statements remedy is implemented  rjr tobacco would incur significant compliance costs and 
table of contents there could be an adverse effect on the sales of operating company products 
additionally  in connection with the document disclosure remedy ordered by the trial court  rjr tobacco has agreed to deposit million in the district court s account across three years

rjr tobacco s overall retail market share of cigarettes has declined in recent years and is expected to continue to decline 
if rjr tobacco is not able to continue to grow market share of its growth brands  or if rjr tobacco and rai s other operating companies are not able to develop  produce or market new alternative tobacco products profitably  the results of operations  cash flows and financial position of such companies and  consequently  of rai could be adversely impacted 
rjr tobacco s us retail market share of cigarettes has been declining for a number of years  and is expected to continue to decline 
according to data from iri capstone  rjr tobacco s share of the us cigarette retail market declined to in from in  continuing a trend in effect for several years 
if rjr tobacco s growth brands do not continue to grow combined market share  results of operations  cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected 
in addition  consumer health concerns  changes in adult consumer preferences and changes in regulations have prompted rjr tobacco and other rai operating companies to introduce new alternative tobacco products 
consumer acceptance of these new products  such as camel snus and electronic cigarettes  may fall below expectations 
furthermore  rai s operating companies may not find vendors willing to produce alternative tobacco products  or components or raw materials used in such products  resulting in additional capital expenditures for rai s operating companies 
rjr tobacco is dependent on the us cigarette market  which it expects to continue to decline  negatively impacting revenue 
the international rights to substantially all of rjr tobacco s brands were sold in to jti  and no international rights were acquired in connection with the b w business combination 
therefore  rjr tobacco is dependent on the us cigarette market 
price increases  restrictions on advertising and promotions  funding of smoking prevention campaigns  increases in regulation and excise taxes  health concerns  a decline in the social acceptability of smoking  increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors have reduced us cigarette consumption 
us cigarette consumption is expected to continue to decline 
msai reported that us cigarette shipments declined in  to billion cigarettes  in and in in addition  rjr tobacco believes its consumers are more price sensitive than consumers of competing brands  which may result in some consumers switching to a lower priced brand 
rjr tobacco is rai s largest operating segment 
as such  it is the primary source of rai s revenue  operating income and cash flows 
in the us  tobacco products are subject to substantial and increasing regulation and taxation  which has a negative effect on revenue and profitability 
tobacco products are subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes in the united states 
certain city and county governments also impose substantial excise taxes on tobacco products sold 
increased excise taxes are likely to result in declines in overall sales volume and shifts by consumers to less expensive brands 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limit the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes  and these laws have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places 
private businesses also have adopted regulations that prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking 
such laws and regulations also are likely to result in a decline in the overall sales volume of cigarettes 
for additional information on the issues described above  see governmental activity in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 
table of contents rai s operating subsidiaries are subject to significant limitations on advertising and marketing of tobacco products  which could harm the value of their existing brands or their ability to launch new brands  thus negatively impacting revenue 
in the united states  television and radio advertisements of cigarettes have been prohibited since  and television and radio advertisements of smokeless tobacco products have been prohibited since under the msa  rai s operating subsidiaries  rjr tobacco and sfntc  cannot use billboard advertising  cartoon characters  sponsorship of certain events  non tobacco merchandise bearing their brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques 
the msa also prohibits targeting of youth in advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products  including the smokeless tobacco products of rjr tobacco 
american snuff co 
is not a participant in the msa 
although these restrictions were intended to ensure that tobacco advertising was not aimed at young people  some of the restrictions also may limit the ability of rai s operating subsidiaries to communicate with adult tobacco users 
in addition  pursuant to the fda tobacco act  the fda has reissued regulations addressing advertising and marketing restrictions that were originally promulgated in additional restrictions under the fda regulations  or otherwise  may be imposed or agreed to in the future 
the regulation of tobacco products by the fda may adversely affect rai s sales and operating profit 
the fda tobacco act grants the fda broad authority over the manufacture  sale  marketing and packaging of tobacco products 
it is likely that the fda tobacco act could result in a decrease in cigarette and smokeless tobacco sales in the united states  including sales of rjr tobacco s  american snuff s and santa fe s brands  and an increase in costs to rjr tobacco  american snuff and santa fe  resulting in a material adverse effect on rai s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
rai believes that such regulation may adversely affect the ability of its operating subsidiaries to compete against their larger competitor  altria group inc  which may be able to more quickly and cost effectively comply with these new rules and regulations 
the fda has yet to issue guidance with respect to many provisions of the fda tobacco act  which may result in less efficient compliance efforts 
finally  the ability of rai s operating companies to gain efficient market clearance for new tobacco products could be affected by fda rules and regulations 
for a detailed description of the fda tobacco act  see governmental activity in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item rjr tobacco s  american snuff s and santa fe s volumes  market share and profitability may be adversely affected by competitive actions and pricing pressures in the marketplace 
the tobacco industry is highly competitive 
among the major manufacturers  brands primarily compete on product quality  price  brand recognition  brand imagery and packaging 
substantial marketing support  merchandising display  discounting  promotions and other financial incentives generally are required to maintain or improve a brand s market position or introduce a new brand 
in addition  substantial payment obligations under the state settlement agreements adversely affect rjr tobacco s ability to compete with manufacturers of deep discount cigarettes that are not subject to such substantial obligations

increases in commodity prices will increase costs and may reduce profitability 
increases in the cost of tobacco leaf  other raw materials and other commodities used in rai s operating subsidiaries products could cause profits to decline 
certain of rai s operating subsidiaries may be required to write down intangible assets  including goodwill  due to impairment  thus reducing operating profit 

table of contents intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and other intangibles 
the determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment 
for goodwill  the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves  among other things  rai s market capitalization  and application of the income approach  which includes developing forecasts of future cash flows and determining an appropriate discount rate 
if goodwill impairment is implied  the fair values of individual assets and liabilities  including unrecorded intangibles  must be determined 
rai believes it has based its goodwill impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  and during the annual testing in the fourth quarter of  the estimated fair value of each of rai s reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value 
trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives also are tested for impairment annually  in the fourth quarter 
at december   the aggregate fair value of rai s operating units trademarks and other intangible assets was substantially in excess of their aggregate carrying value 
however  at december   the individual fair values of seven trademarks were less than in excess of their respective carrying values 
the aggregate carrying value of these seven trademarks was million at december  see
