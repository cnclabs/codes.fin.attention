we also operate tommy bahama restaurants and license the tommy bahama name for various product categories 
during fiscal  of tommy bahama sales were to customers within the united states  with the remaining sales primarily being in australia and asia 
we believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long term growth  we must continue to invest in the tommy bahama brand 
fiscal was a year of significant investment for tommy bahama  which negatively impacted operating income 
our investments in fiscal included costs associated with operating an international infrastructure but not yet having sufficient product sales in these geographic areas to offset the cost  significant pre opening expenses  including rent  and set up costs associated with our new york city restaurant retail location  which opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal and is larger and more expensive  both for rental amounts and initial store build out  than our typical locations  and the pre opening and set up costs associated with our other domestic and international store openings 
in addition to these expenses that impacted operating income  we also incurred significant capital expenditures in fiscal related to new store openings  including the capital expenditures at our new york city tommy bahama location 
similarly  we anticipate that fiscal will also be a significant investment year for the tommy bahama brand as we continue to dedicate resources to our international expansion 
in fiscal  we anticipate that we will incur an operating loss in our international operations as we will not have sufficient sales to offset the ongoing infrastructure costs in place 
additionally  we will continue to open additional tommy bahama domestic and international stores in fiscal  including two retail stores in japan  resulting in our incurring certain pre opening expenses that will negatively impact our operating income in fiscal while we believe that our investments will provide long term benefits  we believe that these investments will have a negative impact in future years until we have sufficient 
table of contents sales in our tommy bahama asian operations to offset the ongoing infrastructure costs 
further  we will also incur capital expenditures in fiscal related to new store openings  but we do not anticipate that the amount of capital expenditures will be as significant as the levels in fiscal we believe that the attraction of the tommy bahama brand to our consumers is a reflection of our efforts to ensure that we maintain appropriate quality and design of our apparel and licensed products  while also restricting the distribution of tommy bahama products to a select tier of retailers 
we will continue to work diligently to maintain these critical qualities of the brand 
we believe that the retail sales value of all tommy bahama branded products sold during fiscal  including our estimate of retail sales by our wholesale customers and other third party retailers  was approximately million 
design  sourcing and distribution tommy bahama products are designed by product specific teams who focus on the target consumer 
the design process includes feedback from buyers  consumers and sales agents  along with market trend research 
our tommy bahama apparel products generally incorporate fabrics made of cotton  silk  linen  nylon  leather  tencel or blends of two or more of these fiber types 
we operate a buying office located in hong kong to manage the production and sourcing of substantially all of our tommy bahama products 
during fiscal  we utilized approximately suppliers  which are primarily located in china  to manufacture our tommy bahama products 
the largest suppliers of tommy bahama products provided of the products acquired during fiscal we operate a tommy bahama distribution center in auburn  washington 
activities at the distribution center include receiving finished goods from suppliers  inspecting the products and shipping the products to our tommy bahama stores  our wholesale customers and our e commerce customers 
we seek to maintain sufficient levels of tommy bahama inventory at the distribution center to support our direct to consumer operations  as well as pre booked orders and anticipated sales volume of our wholesale customers 
we utilize third party distribution centers for our asian and australian operations 
direct to consumer operations a key component of our tommy bahama growth strategy is to operate our own stores and e commerce website  which we believe permits us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which the products are based 
our tommy bahama direct to consumer channels  which consist of retail store  e commerce and restaurant operations  in the aggregate  represented of tommy bahama net sales in fiscal we expect the percentage of our tommy bahama sales which are direct to consumer sales will increase slightly in future years as we anticipate that the direct to consumer distribution channel will continue to grow at a faster pace than the wholesale distribution channel 
store  e commerce and restaurant net sales accounted for  and  respectively  of tommy bahama net sales in fiscal during fiscal  and of our full price retail store sales were sales of tommy bahama men and women apparel products  respectively  with the remainder of the full price retail store sales being home products and other accessories 
for tommy bahama full price retail stores and restaurant retail locations operating for the full fiscal year  sales per gross square foot  excluding restaurant sales and restaurant space  were approximately during the week fiscal  compared to for stores operating for the entire week fiscal year 
this per square foot sales information excludes the sales and square feet of our outlet stores  which in fiscal generated approximately per square foot for outlets open for the entire week fiscal year 
for relocated stores  for which the square feet changed during 
table of contents the year  we included  for the purposes of the calculation above  the square feet of the relocated store based on the weighted average month end square feet for the relocated store 
our direct to consumer strategy for the tommy bahama brand includes locating and operating full price retail stores in upscale malls  lifestyle shopping centers  resort destinations and brand appropriate street locations 
generally  we seek malls and shopping areas with high profile or luxury consumer brands for our full price retail stores 
our full price retail stores allow us the opportunity to carry a full line of current season merchandise  including apparel  home products and accessories  all presented in an aspirational  island inspired atmosphere designed to be relaxed  comfortable and unique 
we believe that the tommy bahama retail stores provide high visibility for the brand and products  and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers 
further  we believe that our presentation of products and our strategy to operate the retail stores as full price stores with limited in store promotional activities are good for the tommy bahama brand and  in turn  enhance business with our wholesale customers 
our tommy bahama outlet stores  which generated of our total tommy bahama net sales in fiscal  are generally located in upscale outlet shopping centers and serve an important role in overall inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out of season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties 
we believe that this approach helps us protect the integrity of the tommy bahama brand by allowing our full price retail stores to limit promotional activity and controlling the distribution of discontinued and out of season product 
as of february  we operated restaurants  generally adjacent to a tommy bahama full price retail store location  which together we often refer to as islands 
these restaurant retail locations provide us with the opportunity to immerse customers in the ultimate tommy bahama experience 
we do not anticipate that many of our retail locations will have an adjacent restaurant  however  in select high profile  brand appropriate locations  such as naples  florida and new york city  we have determined that an adjacent restaurant can further enhance the image of the brand 
generally  net sales per square foot in our full price retail stores which are adjacent to a restaurant outpace the net sales per square foot of our typical full price retail store  as we believe that the restaurant experience may entice the customer to purchase additional tommy bahama merchandise 
as of february   the total square feet of space utilized for our tommy bahama full price retail store and outlet store operations was million with another million of total square feet

we anticipate that the average total gross square feet of full price retail space and outlet space used in the tommy bahama domestic and international operations will increase by approximately and in the mid to high teens percentage range  respectively  for fiscal  as compared to fiscal average total gross square feet amounts 
in fiscal  we currently expect to open domestic retail locations in total  with slightly more than half of the new stores being outlet stores 
we currently anticipate opening eight to domestic retail locations per year beyond fiscal additionally  we expect to open four or five international stores in fiscal although the specific locations and timing of all of our domestic and international store openings have not been finalized  we anticipate opening locations in tokyo  sydney  miami and chicago  among other cities  in fiscal 
table of contents the operation of full price retail stores  outlet stores and restaurant retail locations requires a greater amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations  as well as greater ongoing operating costs 
we estimate that we will spend approximately million and million on average in connection with the build out of a domestic full price retail store and domestic outlet store  respectively 
however  individual locations  particularly those in urban locations including chicago  may require investments greater than these amounts depending on a variety of factors  including the location and size of the store 
the cost of a restaurant retail location can vary significantly depending on a variety of factors 
historically  the cost of our restaurant retail locations has been approximately million  however  we have spent significantly more than that amount for certain locations  including the new york restaurant retail location which opened in fiscal also  the international retail store and outlet store locations that we open in the future may be more expensive than our domestic retail stores depending on the location and size of the store as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and other factors 
for certain of our stores  the landlord often provides certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures 
we also incur capital expenditures when a lease expires and we determine it is appropriate to relocate a store to a new location in the same vicinity as the previous store 
we anticipate having four store relocations during fiscal the cost of store relocations is generally comparable to the costs of opening a new full price retail store or outlet store 
in addition to our new store openings and relocations  we also incur capital expenditure costs related to periodic remodels of existing stores  particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term  or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate 
the costs associated with some remodels may be significant

wholesale sales for tommy bahama accounted for of tommy bahama net sales in fiscal we believe that the integrity and continued success of the tommy bahama brand  including its direct to consumer operations  is dependent  in part  upon careful selection of the retailers through which tommy bahama products are sold

the brand has evolved into a british modernist lifestyle brand of apparel targeted at style conscious men ages to in multiple markets throughout the world 
during fiscal  and of ben sherman net sales occurred in the united kingdom and the united states  respectively  with the remainder of the sales predominantly in europe 
ben sherman products can be found in better department stores  a variety of independent specialty stores and our owned and licensed ben sherman retail stores  as well as on ben sherman e commerce websites 
we also license the ben sherman name for various product categories 
we believe the attraction of the ben sherman brand to our consumers is a reflection of our efforts to ensure that we maintain appropriate quality and design of our apparel and licensed products  while also implementing restricted distribution of the ben sherman products to a select tier of retailers 
we believe this approach to quality  design and distribution will allow us to achieve higher retail price points for our ben sherman products than we have historically achieved 
we believe that the retail sales value of all ben sherman branded products sold during fiscal  including our estimate of retail sales by our wholesale customers and other third party retailers  exceeded million 

table of contents in recent years  we have implemented certain initiatives to elevate our wholesale distribution in order to attain higher price points for our ben sherman men products  reduce our infrastructure and license certain of our non core businesses to third parties to allow us to focus our resources on our core business men sportswear 
although we have made significant strides in elevating our wholesale distribution  we believe we still have additional steps to take in order to achieve our ideal wholesale distribution  which may result in a further decline of wholesale sales in the short term 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal we have taken additional actions to further reduce the infrastructure and operating costs of ben sherman given the smaller sales base in recent years and  at the same time  ensure that the direction of the brand is focused 
we believe that the initiatives taken thus far and expected in the short term are critical steps towards improving the operating results of the ben sherman brand 
we believe that in the long term  ben sherman  with a smaller infrastructure  will have growth opportunities if the elevation of the brand is successful and the economic conditions improve 
design  sourcing and distribution ben sherman men apparel products are developed by our dedicated design teams located at the ben sherman headquarters in london  england 
our ben sherman design teams focus on the target consumer  and the design process combines feedback from buyers  consumers and our sales force  along with market trend research 
we design our ben sherman apparel products to incorporate various fiber types  including cotton  wool or other natural fibers  synthetics  or blends of two or more of these materials 
we primarily utilize a large third party buying agent based in hong kong to manage the production and sourcing of the majority of our ben sherman apparel products  approximately of our ben sherman apparel products are sourced from china and india 
through this buying agent and a sourcing office we operate in india  during fiscal we used approximately suppliers primarily located in china  india and thailand to manufacture our ben sherman products 
the largest suppliers provided of the ben sherman products acquired during fiscal we use a third party distribution center in the united kingdom for our ben sherman products sold in the united kingdom and europe 
in the united states  distribution services are performed for ben sherman at our owned distribution center in lyons  georgia 
distribution center activities include receiving finished goods  inspecting the products and shipping the products to wholesale customers  our ben sherman retail stores and our e commerce customers 
we seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to support pre booked orders and anticipated sales volume for our wholesale customers as well as sales for our direct to consumer operations 
wholesale operations during fiscal  of ben sherman net sales were sales to wholesale customers and international distributors 
during fiscal  of ben sherman net sales were to its five largest customers  of which no individual customer accounted for greater than of ben sherman net sales 
as discussed above  in recent years  we have implemented certain initiatives to elevate our wholesale distribution in order to attain higher price points for our ben sherman men products which  if effective  will provide growth opportunities for the brand in the future 
we maintain ben sherman apparel sales offices and showrooms in several locations  including london  new york and dusseldorf  among others 
our wholesale operations for ben sherman utilize a sales force consisting of salaried sales employees and independent commissioned sales representatives 

table of contents direct to consumer operations our direct to consumer strategy for the ben sherman brand includes locating full price retail stores in brand appropriate street locations and malls 
each full price retail store carries a wide range of merchandise  including apparel  footwear and accessories  all presented in a manner intended to enhance the ben sherman image 
our ben sherman full price retail stores allow the opportunity to present ben sherman full line of current season products  including licensees products 
we believe our ben sherman retail stores provide high visibility of the brand and products and also enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers 
we believe the presentation of these products in our ben sherman full price retail stores helps build brand awareness and acceptance and thus enhances business with our wholesale customers 
our outlet stores serve an important role in the overall inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out of season products at better prices than are generally otherwise available from outside parties  while helping us protect the ben sherman brand by controlling the distribution of such products  although at times we also utilize off price retailers to sell these products 
the components of ben sherman direct to consumer strategy include retail store  concession and e commerce operations and represented of ben sherman net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal retail store sales per square foot were approximately for our ben sherman full price retail stores  which excludes outlets  which were open throughout the week fiscal compared to approximately for ben sherman full price retail stores open throughout the week fiscal the decrease from fiscal was primarily due to lower full price comparable store sales and the negative impact of lower sales per square foot from two full price stores located in the united kingdom which opened in fiscal the table below provides certain information regarding ben sherman retail stores as of february  number of stores average square feet united states full price retail stores united kingdom full price retail stores germany full price retail stores outlet stores total total gross square feet at year end includes four  two and one outlet stores in the united kingdom  europe and the united states  respectively 
the table below reflects the changes in store count for ben sherman stores during fiscal full price retail stores outlet stores total open as of beginning of fiscal year opened during fiscal year open as of end of fiscal year we do not anticipate a significant increase in the retail store square feet from fiscal to fiscal as we do not currently have any plans to open new ben sherman stores in fiscal however  we continue to evaluate potential locations and may open retail stores in the future if we identify locations which meet our investment criteria 
the operation of our retail stores requires a greater 
table of contents amount of initial capital investment than wholesale operations as well as greater ongoing operating costs 
based on recent store openings  we have spent approximately million of capital expenditures on average to build out a ben sherman full price retail store and less than that to build out an outlet store 
however  individual locations will vary 
in some cases  the landlord has provided certain incentives to fund a portion of these capital expenditures 
we also incur capital expenditures when a lease expires and we determine it is appropriate to relocate a store to a new location in the same vicinity as the previous store 
the cost of store relocations will generally be comparable to the costs of opening a new store 
in addition to our new store openings and relocations  we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels of existing stores  particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term  or otherwise determine that a remodel of a store is appropriate 
the costs associated with some remodels may be significant 
another component of our direct to consumer strategy is operating certain concession arrangements  whereby we operate ben sherman shops within department or other stores 
the inventory at these locations is owned by us until sold to the consumer  at which time we recognize the full retail sales price 
in these arrangements  a ben sherman employee is responsible for the area  and we pay a commission to the department store to cover occupancy and certain other costs associated with using the space 
as of february   we operated nine concession locations in the united kingdom 
during fiscal  we re launched the bensherman 
com website in the united kingdom and europe  and during fiscal we re launched the bensherman 
com website in the united states 
these websites provide consumers the opportunity to purchase ben sherman products directly on line 
although the net sales of ben sherman e commerce operations were less than of net sales for ben sherman in fiscal  we believe that the ben sherman customer base will embrace a high quality  brand appropriate e commerce site and that e commerce is an important growth opportunity for the ben sherman brand 
licensing distributor operations we license the ben sherman trademark to a variety of licensees in categories beyond ben sherman core product categories  including footwear and kids apparel 
we believe licensing is an attractive business opportunity for the ben sherman brand 
once a brand is established  licensing requires modest additional investment for us but can yield high margin income 
it also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure 
in evaluating a potential ben sherman licensee  we typically consider the candidate experience  financial stability  manufacturing performance and marketing ability 
we also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed products with other ben sherman brand products 
our agreements with ben sherman licensees are for specific geographic areas and expire at various dates in the future 
generally  the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty and advertising payments based on specified percentages of the licensee net sales of the licensed products 
our license agreements generally provide us the right to approve all products  advertising and proposed channels of distribution 

table of contents third party license arrangements for ben sherman products include the following product categories footwear kid apparel men watches and jewelry men tailored clothes and dress shirts men hats  caps  scarves and gloves men neckwear and pocket squares men fragrances and toiletries men and boys underwear  socks and sleepwear men gift products in addition to the license agreements for the specific product categories listed above  we have also entered into certain international license distribution agreements which give these third parties the opportunity to distribute ben sherman products in certain geographic areas around the world 
the products sold by our licensees distributors generally are identical to the products sold in the united kingdom and united states 
in most markets  our licensees distributors are required to open retail stores in their respective geographic regions 
as of february   our licensees distributors operated ben sherman retail stores located in australia  asia  south africa  europe and canada 
seasonal aspects of business ben sherman net sales are impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style  as well as by distribution channel  may vary significantly depending on the time of year 
the sales of ben sherman generally align with a typical wholesale and retail apparel company whereby the fall and holiday seasons are generally stronger quarters than the first half of the fiscal year 
the following table presents the percentage of net sales for ben sherman by quarter for fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales as the timing of certain unusual or non recurring items  economic conditions  wholesale product shipments or other factors affecting the business may vary from one year to the next  we do not believe that net sales or operating loss for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating loss for fiscal are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years 
specifically  we believe that as a result of the significant impact of the merchandising mix miss in the second half of fiscal and our expectation of improved operating results in future years  presenting the percentages of operating loss by quarter for ben sherman in fiscal would not be meaningful in assessing the seasonal aspects of the ben sherman business for future periods 
therefore  we have not included operating loss by quarter in the table above 
the timing of ben sherman sales in the direct to consumer and wholesale distribution channels generally varies 
typically  the demand in the direct to consumer operations  including sales for our own stores and e commerce sites  for ben sherman products in our principal markets is generally higher in the fall and holiday seasons and lower in the spring and summer seasons 
wholesale product shipments are generally shipped prior to each of the retail selling seasons 
as the allocation of sales within a quarter is impacted by the seasonality of direct to consumer and wholesale sales  we have presented in the following table the proportion of net sales for each quarter represented by each distribution channel for fiscal  which may not necessarily be indicative of the allocation of sales in future periods first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year wholesale direct to consumer total 
table of contents corporate and other corporate and other is a reconciling category for reporting purposes and includes our corporate offices  substantially all financing activities  elimination of inter segment sales  lifo inventory accounting adjustments  other costs that are not allocated to the operating groups and operations of our other businesses which are not included in our four operating groups 
the operations that are included in corporate and other include our oxford golf business and our lyons  georgia distribution center 
the oxford golf brand is designed to appeal to a sophisticated golf apparel consumer with a preference for high quality and classic styling 
in addition to apparel bearing the oxford golf trademark  oxford golf also sources some private label products for certain customers 
our oxford golf products are primarily acquired on a package purchase  finished goods basis from third party producers outside of the united states 
oxford golf seeks to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to support programs for pre booked orders and at once ordering 
oxford golf employs a sales force consisting primarily of commissioned sales agents 
our lyons  georgia distribution center receives finished goods from suppliers  inspects those products and ships the products to customers of our oxford golf business and to customers and retail stores of our ben sherman united states business while also performing certain warehouse and distribution services for third parties 
discontinued operations references to results of operations  assets or liabilities related to discontinued operations within this report refer to the operations  assets or liabilities associated with our former oxford apparel operating group  which were sold on january  our former oxford apparel operating group sold certain private label and branded apparel to a variety of customers 
additionally  unless otherwise indicated  all references to assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses included in this report reflect continuing operations and do not include any amounts related to the discontinued operations 
advertising and marketing we believe that advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long term strategy of our brands  and we therefore devote significant resources to advertising and marketing our brands 
during fiscal  we spent million on advertising  marketing and promoting our products 
for each of our lifestyle brands  we incurred advertising  marketing and promotions expenses of to of net sales of the lifestyle brand during fiscal each of our operating groups manages the advertising  marketing and promotion of its brands 
while the advertising of our lifestyle brands promotes our products  the primary emphasis is on brand image and brand lifestyle 
we intend that the advertising will engage individuals within the brand distinct consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our retail stores  e commerce websites or wholesale customers stores in search of our products 
the marketing of our lifestyle brands continues to include traditional media such as print  catalogs and other correspondence with customers  as well as moving media and trade show initiatives 
however  an increasing amount of our marketing focus involves email  internet and social media advertising 
we believe that it is very important that we communicate regularly with our consumers via the use of email  internet and social media about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen our brands connections with our consumers 
we also believe that highly visible retail store locations with creative design  broad merchandise selection and brand appropriate visual presentation are key enticements for customers to visit our retail stores and buy merchandise 
we intend that our retail stores enhance the retail experience of our customers  which we believe will increase consumer brand loyalty 
marketing initiatives at certain of our retail stores may include special event promotions and a variety of public relations activities designed to create awareness of our stores and products 
we believe that our retail store operations as well as our 
table of contents traditional media and electronic media communications increase the sales of our own retail stores and e commerce operations  as well as the sales of our products for our wholesale customers 
for certain of our wholesale customers we also provide point of sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our branded products at their retail locations and or participate in cooperative advertising programs 
trademarks as discussed above  we own trademarks  several of which are very important to our business 
generally  our significant trademarks are subject to registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel and  in some cases  apparel related products  accessories  home furnishings and beauty products  as well as in connection with retail services 
we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of certain of our trademarks 
in general  trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with our products and services and the required registration renewals are filed 
our significant trademarks are discussed within each operating group description 
important factors relating to risks associated with our trademarks include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
product sourcing we intend to maintain a flexible  diversified  cost effective manufacturing base that provides high quality branded products 
our operating groups  either internally or through the use of third party buying agents  source substantially all of our products from non exclusive  third party producers located in foreign countries or from our licensees for licensed products sold in our direct to consumer distribution channels 
the use of contract manufacturers reduces the amount of capital investment required by us as operating manufacturing facilities can require a significant amount of capital investment 
during fiscal  we sourced approximately of our products from producers located in china 
although we place a high value on long term relationships with our suppliers and have used many of our suppliers for a number of years  generally we do not have long term contracts with our suppliers 
instead  we conduct business on an order by order basis 
thus  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers 
we believe that this approach provides us with the greatest flexibility in identifying the appropriate manufacturers while considering quality  cost  timing of product delivery and other criteria while also utilizing the expertise of the manufacturers 
during fiscal  no individual third party manufacturer supplied more than of our product purchases 
we purchase substantially all of our tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman products from third party producers as package purchases of finished goods  which are manufactured with our oversight and to our design and fabric specifications 
for package purchases  we regularly depend upon the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials specified by us  adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity rather than us providing or financing the costs of these items 
we believe that our focus on acquiring package purchases allows us to reduce our working capital requirements as we generally are not required to purchase  or finance the purchase of  the raw materials or other production costs related to our product purchases until we take ownership of the finished goods  which typically occurs when the goods are shipped by the third party producers 
for our lanier clothes operating group  we acquired the majority of our lanier clothes products during fiscal on a package purchase basis from third party producers 
the remainder of the inventory purchases from third parties were primarily on a cmt basis  which we consider to be purchases whereby we supply the fabric and purchase cut  sew and finish labor or cut  make  trim from our third party producers 
as the ability and willingness of third party tailored clothing apparel 
table of contents manufacturers to finance raw materials purchases continues to increase along with other changes in manufacturing and sourcing practices for tailored clothing  we anticipate that lanier clothes will continue to increase the percentage of goods acquired as package purchases of finished goods rather than cmt purchases 
in addition to purchasing products from third parties  lanier clothes also operates our only owned manufacturing facility  which is located in merida  mexico and produced of our lanier clothes products during fiscal as the manufacture and transportation of apparel products for our brands may take as many as six months for each season  we typically make commitments months in advance of when products will arrive in our retail stores or our customers stores 
we continue to seek ways to reduce the time required from design and ordering to bringing products to our customer 
as our merchandising departments must estimate our requirements for finished goods purchases for our own retail stores and e commerce sites based on historical product demand data and other factors  and as purchases for our wholesale accounts must be committed to and purchased by us prior to the receipt of customer orders in some cases  we carry the risk that we have purchased more inventory than we will need 
we are committed to sourcing our products in a lawful and responsible manner 
as part of this commitment  each of our operating groups has implemented a code of conduct program applicable to vendors that we purchase goods from  which includes provisions related to abiding by applicable laws as well as compliance with other business ethics  including related human rights  health  safety  working conditions  environmental and other requirements 
we require that each of our vendors and licensees comply with the applicable code of conduct 
on an ongoing basis we assess vendors compliance with the applicable code of conduct through assessments performed by either our employees or our designated agents 
in the event we determine that a vendor is not abiding by the applicable code of conduct  we work with the vendor to remediate the violation 
if the violation is not remediated  we generally will discontinue use of the vendor 
import restrictions and other government regulations we are exposed to certain risks as a result of our international operations 
almost all of our merchandise is manufactured by foreign suppliers 
during fiscal  we sourced approximately of our products from producers located in china 
our imported products are subject to customs  trade and other laws and regulations governing their entry into the united states and other countries where we sell our products 
substantially all of the merchandise we acquire is subject to duties which are assessed on the value of the imported product and represent a material portion of the cost of the goods we sell 
duty rates vary depending on the type of garment and its fiber content and are subject to change in future periods 
in addition  while the world trade organization member nations have eliminated quotas on apparel and textiles  the united states and european countries into which we import our products are still allowed in certain circumstances to unilaterally impose anti dumping or countervailing duties in response to threats to their comparable domestic industries 
in addition  apparel and other products sold by us are subject to stringent and complex product performance and security and safety standards  laws and other regulations 
these regulations relate principally to product labeling  licensing requirements  certification of product safety and importer security procedures 
we believe that we are in material compliance with those regulations 
our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation 
our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations  and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on our business or results of operations 
although we have not been materially inhibited from doing business in desired markets in the past  we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and brands and enter into new markets 
our management regularly monitors proposed 
table of contents regulatory changes and the existing regulatory environment  including any impact on our operations or on our ability to import products 
important factors relating to risks associated with government regulations include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
information technologies we believe that sophisticated information systems are an important component of maintaining our competitive position and supporting continued growth of our businesses 
our management information systems were designed to provide effective retail store  e commerce and wholesale operations while emphasizing efficient point of sale  distribution center  design  sourcing  order processing  marketing  accounting and other functions 
we use point of sale registers that capture sales data  track inventories and monitor traffic and other information in our retail stores 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our information technologies and upgrade or enhance our systems to gain operating efficiencies and to support our anticipated growth as well as other changes in our business 
we believe that continuous upgrading and enhancements to our management information systems with newer technology that offers greater efficiency  functionality and reporting capabilities is important to our operations and financial condition 
seasonal aspects of business each of our operating groups is impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style  as well as by distribution channel  may vary significantly depending on the time of year 
for details of the impact of seasonality on each of our operating groups  see the business discussion of each operating group above 
the following table presents our percentage of net sales and operating income by quarter for fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales operating income the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income included a million lifo accounting charge 
additionally  the fourth quarter of fiscal included a charge of million for the change in fair value of contingent consideration whereas the first three quarters of fiscal included a million charge for the change in fair value of contingent consideration 
these items resulted in the percentage of operating income in the fourth quarter being lower and the first three quarters being higher than if these charges did not occur in the fourth quarter 
we anticipate that as our retail store operations increase in the future  the third quarter will continue to be our weakest net sales and operating income quarter and the percentage of the full year net sales and operating income generated in the third quarter will continue to decrease 
as the timing of certain unusual or non recurring items  economic conditions  wholesale product shipments or other factors affecting the retail business may vary from one year to the next  we do not believe that net sales or operating income for any particular quarter or the distribution of net sales and operating income for fiscal are necessarily indicative of anticipated results for the full fiscal year or expected distribution in future years 
order backlog as more than of our sales are direct to consumer sales  which are not reflected in an order backlog  and the order backlog for wholesale sales may be impacted by a variety of factors  we do not 
table of contents believe that order backlog information is necessarily indicative of sales to be expected for future periods 
therefore  we believe the order backlog is not material for an understanding of our business taken as a whole 
further  as our sales continue to shift towards direct to consumer rather than wholesale sales  the order backlog will continue to be less meaningful as a measure of our future sales and results of operations 
employees as of february   we employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately were employed in the united states 
approximately of our employees were retail store and restaurant employees 
we believe our employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors the risks described below highlight some of the factors that could materially affect our operations 
if any of these risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing business environment  and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and our success depends on the reputation and value of our brand names and our ability to offer innovative and market appropriate products that respond to rapidly changing fashion trends  any failure to maintain the reputation or value of our brands  to offer innovative  fashionable and desirable brands and products and or to appropriately respond to competitive factors within our industry could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation  value and image of brand names  design  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing  and customer service 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference  and presenting appealing products for consumers 
the value of our brands could be diminished by actions taken by us or by our wholesale customers or others  including marketing partners  who have interests in the brands  including by failing to respond to emerging fashion trends or by becoming overly promotional 
we cannot always control the marketing and promotion of our products by our wholesale customers or other third parties and actions by such parties that are inconsistent with our own marketing efforts or that otherwise adversely affect the appeal of our products could diminish the value or reputation of one or more of our brands and have an adverse effect on our sales and business operations 

table of contents during fiscal  tommy bahama net sales represented of our consolidated net sales  while lilly pulitzer and ben sherman net sales represented and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
the limited diversification in our portfolio may heighten the risks we face if one of our brands fails to meet our expectations and or is adversely impacted by any actions we or third parties take with respect to that brand or by competitive conditions in the apparel industry 
for example  ben sherman missteps in merchandise mix in the second half of fiscal  coupled with the sluggish economic conditions in the united kingdom and europe during fiscal  resulted in a fiscal operating loss of million for ben sherman  which not only affected ben sherman operating results but materially impacted our consolidated operating results and the amount of time required by our management to focus on the ben sherman operations 
although certain of our products carry over from season to season  the apparel industry is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands  particularly for our lifestyle branded tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman products 
due to the competitive nature of the apparel industry  there can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline or that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with consumers preferences  fashion trends and changes in consumer demographics 
the introduction or repositioning of new lines and products and the entry of our products into new geographic territories often requires substantial costs in design  marketing and advertising  which may not be recovered if the products are not successful 
any failure on our part to develop and market appealing products could result in lower sales and operating losses and or harm the reputation and desirability of our brands 
additionally  since we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured  such a failure could result in a substantial amount of unsold inventory or other conditions  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  the merchandise mix missteps in ben sherman during the second half of fiscal resulted in higher promotions in our direct to consumer operations  more off price sales and more significant inventory markdowns during the second half of fiscal  as we sought to liquidate excess ben sherman inventory 
the highly competitive apparel industry  characterized by low entry barriers  includes numerous domestic and foreign apparel designers  manufacturers  distributors  importers  licensors and retailers  some of whom may also be our customers and some of whom are significantly larger  more diversified and have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
certain of our competitors offer apparel for sale at significant discounts  particularly in response to weak economic conditions  which results in more pressure to reduce prices or the risk that our products may not be as desirable as lower priced products 
competitive factors within the apparel industry may result in reduced sales  increased costs  lower prices for our products and or decreased margins 
we also license certain of our brands  including tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman  to third party licensees 
while we enter into comprehensive license agreements with these third parties covering product design  product quality  sourcing  manufacturing and marketing requirements and approvals  there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products outside of our core apparel products or due to the actions of a licensee 
the improper or detrimental actions of a licensee could significantly impact the perception of our brands 
in addition  the reputation of our brands could be harmed if our third party manufacturers and vendors  substantially all of which are located outside the united states  fail to meet our product safety  product quality and social compliance standards 
we cannot assure that our manufacturers and vendors will at all times conduct their operations in accordance with ethical practices or that the products we purchase will always meet our safety and quality control standards 
any violation of our applicable codes of conduct or local laws relating to labor conditions by our manufacturers or vendors or other 
table of contents actions or failures by us or such parties may result in negative public perception of our brands or products  as well as disrupt our supply chain  adversely affecting our business operations 
the apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic conditions  and a deterioration or worsening of consumer confidence or consumer purchases of discretionary products may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
consumers may generally consider our products discretionary items 
the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
demand for our products is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending  which may be influenced by employment levels  recessions  fuel and energy costs  availability of personal credit  interest rates  tax rates and changes in tax laws  the european debt crisis  declining purchasing power due to foreign currency fluctuations  personal debt levels  housing prices  stock market volatility  general political conditions and other factors 
the factors impacting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending are outside of our control and difficult to predict  and  often  the apparel industry experiences longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy 
starting in  the global economic environment began to deteriorate 
this has been characterized by a dramatic decline in consumer discretionary spending disproportionately affecting our industry 
while we have seen intermittent signs of stabilization in the united states since fiscal  there is continued volatility in the european markets 
there are no assurances that the united states  european or global economy will recover in the near future or that recessionary conditions will not return to or worsen in these markets 
in addition  the european sovereign debt crisis or unstable political conditions  or potential or actual international conflicts  in the middle east or other parts of the world  could result in disruptions to sourcing of our products from foreign markets 
any deterioration or worsening of consumer confidence or discretionary consumer spending  or disruptions to our supply chain from macroeconomic conditions  could reduce our sales  increase our costs of goods sold or require us to significantly modify our current business practices 
additionally  significant changes in the operations or liquidity of any of the parties with which we conduct our business  including suppliers  customers  trademark licensees and lenders  among others  now or in the future  or in the access to capital markets for any such parties  could result in lower demand for our products  lower sales  higher costs or other disruptions in our business 
we rely to a large extent on third party producers in foreign countries to meet our production demands and failures by these producers to meet our requirements  or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices  may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales 
we source substantially all of our products from non exclusive  third party producers located in foreign countries  including sourcing approximately of our product purchases from china during fiscal although we place a high value on long term relationships with our suppliers  generally we do not have long term contracts but  instead  conduct business on an order by order basis 
therefore  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers 
we regularly depend upon the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials  adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity 
although we monitor production in third party manufacturing locations  we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers  such as the reduction of availability of production capacity  errors in complying with product specifications  insufficient quality control  failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs 
such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis  which may  in turn  have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales 

table of contents changes in international trade regulation and risks relating to the importation of our products may cause our products to become less competitive  disrupt our supply chain and or adversely affect our operations 
we source substantially all of our products from foreign countries  most significantly china 
as a result  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate 
some of the risks associated with importing our products from foreign countries include changes in social  political  labor and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers are located  the imposition of additional or new duties  tariffs  taxes  quota restrictions or other changes and shifts in sourcing patterns as a result of such changes  significant delays in the delivery of our products  due to security or other considerations  fluctuations in sourcing costs  the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties  fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  changes in customs procedures for importing apparel products  and restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries 
we may not be able to offset any disruption to our supply chain as a result of any of these factors by shifting production to suitable manufacturers in other jurisdictions in a timely manner or at acceptable prices  and any of these factors could harm our business  result in a loss of sales and or increase the costs of our goods 
in addition  our  or any of our suppliers  failure to comply with customs or similar laws or any other applicable regulations could restrict our ability to import products or lead to fines  penalties or adverse publicity  and future regulatory actions or trade agreements may provide our competitors with a material advantage over us or materially increase our costs 
loss of one or more of our key wholesale customers  or a significant adverse change in a customer financial performance or financial position could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 
we generate a significant percentage of our wholesale sales from a few major customers 
during fiscal  sales to our five largest customers accounted for of our consolidated wholesale sales and sales to our largest wholesale customer represented of our consolidated wholesale sales 
over the last several years  there has been a trend towards greater consolidation in the retail industry  as well as more centralized purchasing decisions within consolidated customer groups  and direct sourcing of products by large retailers 
a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products  restructuring of our customers operations  more centralized purchasing decisions  direct sourcing and greater leverage by customers  as a result of further consolidation in the retail industry or otherwise  could result in lower prices  realignment of customer affiliations or other factors which could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 
we generally do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
instead  we rely on long standing relationships with these customers and our position within the marketplace 
as a result  purchases generally occur on an order by order basis  and each relationship can generally be terminated by either party at any time 
a decision by one or more of our major customers to terminate its relationship with us or to reduce its purchases from us  whether motivated by competitive considerations  quality or style issues  financial difficulties  economic conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our net sales and profitability  as it would be difficult to immediately  if at all  replace this business with new customers or increase sales volumes with other existing customers 
in addition  due to long product lead times  our product lines are typically designed and manufactured in anticipation of orders for sale 
we make commitments for production in connection with these lines 
these commitments can be made up to several months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers  and if orders do not materialize or are canceled  we may incur expenses to terminate our production commitments or to dispose of excess inventories 
we also extend credit to several of our key customers without requiring collateral  which results in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers 
at february   our five largest 
table of contents outstanding customer balances represented of our consolidated receivables balance 
companies in the apparel industry  including some of our customers  may experience financial difficulties  including bankruptcies  restructurings and reorganizations  tightened credit markets and or declining sales and profitability on a comparable store basis 
a significant adverse change in a customer financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous shipments to that customer 
we rely on the proper operation of our primary distribution facilities in order to support our direct to consumer operations  meet customer expectations  manage inventory  complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies  and any disruption or failure in these facilities may materially adversely affect our business or operations 
our ability to support our direct to consumer operations  meet customer expectations  manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our primary brand focused distribution facilities  each of which manages the receipt  storage  sorting  packing and distribution of finished goods for one of our operating groups 
the primary distribution facilities that we operate are a distribution center in auburn  washington for our tommy bahama products  a distribution center in king of prussia  pennsylvania for our lilly pulitzer products  a distribution center in toccoa  georgia for our lanier clothes products  and a distribution center in lyons  georgia for our ben sherman products sold in the united states 
in addition  in the united kingdom  we utilize a third party distribution center that manages substantially all of the distribution activities for our ben sherman products sold in the united kingdom and europe 
during fiscal  we expect to transition the ben sherman distribution center activities in the united kingdom to another third party facility 
if any of our primary distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason  including as a result of natural or man made disasters  cybersecurity attacks  computer viruses or otherwise  if our distribution facilities fail to upgrade their technological systems to ensure efficient operations  if the goods in a distribution center were otherwise unavailable for shipment  as a result of a technology failure or otherwise  or if we experience any difficulty in transitioning our distribution activities for ben sherman in the united kingdom  we could experience a reduction in sales  a substantial loss of inventory or higher costs  insufficient inventory at our retail stores to meet consumer expectations and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products 
in addition  for the distribution facilities that we operate  there are substantial fixed costs associated with these large  highly automated distribution centers 
we could experience reduced operating and cost efficiencies during periods of economic weakness 
any disruption to our distribution facilities or in their efficient operation could negatively affect our operating results and our customer relationships 
our operations are reliant on information technology and any interruption or other failure may impair our ability to provide products to our customers and meet the needs of management 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology 
information systems are used in all stages of our operations from design to distribution and as a method of communication with our customers and suppliers 
additionally  certain of our operating groups utilize e commerce websites to sell goods directly to consumers 
our management also relies on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information in order to allocate resources and forecast and report our operating results 
service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors  including power outages  computer viruses  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties  disasters  or failures to properly install  upgrade  integrate  protect  repair or maintain our systems and e commerce websites 

table of contents we regularly evaluate upgrades or enhancements to our information systems to more efficiently and competitively operate our business  including an ongoing transition towards more integrated systems for our businesses 
we may experience difficulties during the implementation of this financial system and or not be equipped to address system problems 
any material disruption in our information technology systems  or any failure to timely  efficiently and effectively integrate new systems  could have an adverse affect on our business or results of operations 
our business depends on our senior management and other key personnel  and the unsuccessful transition of key management responsibilities  the unexpected loss of individuals integral to our business  our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or our failure to successfully plan for and implement succession of our senior management and key personnel may have an adverse effect on our operations  business relationships and ability to execute our strategies 
over the last two years  we have announced various changes to our senior management  including the retirement of our long time chief executive officer mr 
j 
hicks lanier from that position on december  our senior management has substantial experience and expertise in the apparel and related industries  with our newly elected chief executive officer mr 
thomas c 
chubb iii having worked with our company for almost years  including in various executive management capacities 
changes in key management positions  including within our operating groups  have inherent risks  and there are no assurances that any of our recent changes in management will not disrupt our business or operations  distract employees and or affect our strategic relationships 
our success also depends upon disciplined execution at all levels of our organization  including our senior management 
competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense  and we compete to attract and retain these individuals with other companies that may have greater financial resources than us 
while we believe that we have depth within our management team  if we lose any key executives  especially if one or more of these individuals join a competitor  our business and financial performance could be harmed 
in addition  we will need to plan for the succession of our senior management and successfully integrate new members of management within our organization 
the unexpected loss of any of our senior management  or the unsuccessful integration of new leadership  could negatively affect our operations  business relationships and ability to execute our strategies 
breaches of information security or privacy could damage our reputation or credibility and cause us financial harm 
as an ongoing part of our business operations  including marketing through various social media tools  we regularly collect and utilize sensitive and confidential personal information 
the regulatory environment governing our use of individually identifiable data of customers  employees and others is complex  and the security of personal information is a matter of public concern 
despite our implementation of security measures  if an actual or perceived data security breach occurs  whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks  computer viruses  vandalism  human error or otherwise  our reputation and credibility could be damaged and we could experience lost sales 
in addition  privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently  and compliance with them or similar security standards  such as those created by the payment card industry  may require us to modify our operations and or incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes 
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations  or similar security standards  could lead to fines  penalties or adverse publicity 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property 
we believe that our trademarks and other intellectual property  as well as certain contractual arrangements  including licenses  and other proprietary intellectual property rights  have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by retailers and consumers 
in fiscal  of our consolidated net sales were attributable to branded products for which we own the trademark 
therefore  our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property 
we rely on laws in the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we may not be able to sufficiently prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization  particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed  causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm the reputation of our brands 
from time to time  we discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our proprietary rights 
these activities typically increase as brand recognition increases  especially in markets outside the united states 
counterfeiting of our brands could divert sales away from our company  and association of our brands with inferior counterfeit reproductions could adversely affect the integrity and reputation of our brands 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
as we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we could become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties 
in the event a claim of infringement against us is successful  we may be required to pay damages  royalties or license fees to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using  or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time 
litigation and other legal action of this type  regardless of whether it is successful  could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our management and other resources 
our business is subject to various federal  foreign  state and local laws and regulations  and the costs of compliance with  or the violation of  such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our costs or operations 
in the united states  we are subject to stringent standards  laws and other regulations  including those relating to health  product performance and safety  labor  employment  privacy and data security  anti bribery  consumer protection  taxation  logistics and similar operational issues 
in addition  operating in foreign jurisdictions  including those where we may operate retail stores  requires compliance with similar laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations  in the united states and abroad  are complex and often varies widely by jurisdiction  making it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently or will be in the future compliant with all applicable laws and regulations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs and or materially limit our ability to operate our business 
in addition  the restaurant industry is highly competitive and requires compliance with a variety of federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  all of our tommy bahama restaurants serve alcohol and  therefore  maintain liquor licenses 
our ability to maintain our liquor licenses depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the loss of a liquor license would adversely affect the profitability of a restaurant 
additionally  as a participant in the restaurant industry  we face risks related to food quality  food borne illness  injury  health inspection scores and labor relations 

table of contents regardless of whether allegations related to these matters are valid or whether we become liable  we may be materially affected by negative publicity associated with these issues 
the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one restaurant may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of the other restaurants  as well as the image of the tommy bahama brand as a whole 
changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 
as a global apparel company  we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
we record our income tax liability based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations  which requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation 
our effective income tax rate in any particular period or in future periods may be affected by a number of factors  including among others a shift in the mix of revenues  income and or losses among domestic and international sources during a year or over a period of years  changes in tax laws  the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions  and the resolution of uncertain tax positions  any of which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 
fluctuations and volatility in the cost and availability of raw materials  labor and freight may materially increase our costs 
we and our third party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices 
the principal fabrics used in our business are cotton  linens  wools  silk  other natural fibers  synthetics and blends of these materials 
the prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them 
in addition  the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process  such as oil related commodity prices and other raw materials  such as dyes and chemicals  and other costs  can fluctuate 
during fiscal and fiscal  we saw an increase in the costs of raw materials  particularly cotton  as a result of rising demand from the economic recovery  weather related supply disruptions  significant declines in us inventory and a sharp rise in the futures market for cotton 
we historically have not entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices 
in addition  we have recently seen increases in the cost of labor at many of our suppliers  particularly with the growth of the middle class in certain developing countries  as well as in freight costs  resulting from increased oil prices 
we believe that these cost pressures may not be alleviated in the near future and could further increase 
although we attempt to mitigate the effect of increases in our cost of goods sold through sourcing initiatives and by selectively increasing the prices of our products  these product costing pressures  as well as other variable cost pressures  may materially increase our costs  and we may be unable to fully pass on these costs to our customers  particularly in our lanier clothes and ben sherman operating groups 
we may be unable to grow our business through organic growth and or  if and when appropriate  acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model  and any failure to successfully execute this aspect of our business strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
one component of our business strategy is to grow our business through organic growth and or  if and when appropriate  acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model 
organic growth may be achieved by  among other things  increasing our market share in existing markets  including to existing wholesale customers  selling our products in new markets  including international markets  increasing sales in our direct to consumer channels  and increasing the product offerings within our various operating groups 
successful growth of our business through organic growth and or 
table of contents acquisitions is subject to  among other things  the ability of our management to implement plans for expanding our existing businesses and our ability to find suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices in the future 
we may not be successful in this regard  and our inability to grow our business may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
continued challenges with implementing our long term strategic plans at ben sherman could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the ben sherman brand continues to face challenges due to our ongoing elevation of the distribution of the brand  the sluggish economic conditions in the united kingdom and europe and missteps in the merchandise mix in our own retail stores in the second half of fiscal ben sherman recent results have been exacerbated by a number of related factors  including operational and product assortment issues relating to inventory management  control of expenses  buying and merchandising decisions  pricing decisions and underperformance of retail stores 
while we believe that ben sherman will have growth opportunities in the long term if the elevation of the brand is successful and the economic conditions in the united kingdom and europe improve  there can be no assurances that our actions will be successful 
continued operational or product issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the acquisition of new businesses has certain inherent risks  including  for example  strains on our management team and unexpected acquisition costs 
from time to time  we acquire new businesses or product lines when we believe appropriate investment opportunities are available 
as a result of acquisitions  we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence 
although we may be entitled to indemnification against undisclosed liabilities from the sellers of the acquired business  we cannot be certain that the indemnification  even if obtained  will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or assets acquired 
any of these liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  integrating acquired businesses is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
the integration process for newly acquired businesses could create for us a number of challenges and adverse consequences associated with the integration of product lines  employees  sales teams and outsourced manufacturers  employee turnover  including key management and creative personnel of the acquired and existing businesses  disruption in product cycles for newly acquired product lines  maintenance of acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired and existing businesses 
further  we may not be able to manage the combined operations and assets effectively or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
we may not be successful in identifying locations and negotiating appropriate lease terms for retail stores and restaurants 
an integral part of our strategy has been to develop and operate retail stores and restaurants for certain of our lifestyle brands 
net sales from our retail stores and restaurants were of our consolidated net sales during fiscal we expect to increase the number of our retail stores during fiscal and in future years  including opening tommy bahama retail stores in geographic territories where we have not previously operated tommy bahama retail stores 
we lease all of our retail store and restaurant locations 
successful operation of our retail stores and restaurants depends  in part  on our ability to identify desirable  brand appropriate retail locations  
table of contents the overall ability of the retail location to attract a consumer base sufficient to make store sales volume profitable  and our ability to negotiate satisfactory lease terms and employ qualified personnel 
we compete with other retailers for these favorable store locations  lease terms and desired personnel 
if we are unable to identify new locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level or the local market reception to a new retail store opening is inconsistent with our expectations  retail growth may be limited 
further  if existing retail stores and restaurants do not maintain a sufficient customer base that provides a reasonable sales volume  it could have a negative impact on our sales  gross margin  and results of operations 
our retail store and restaurant leases generally represent long term financial commitments for which we also incur substantial fixed costs for each location design  leasehold improvements  fixtures and systems installation 
from time to time  we seek to downsize or close some of our retail store or restaurant operations  which may require a modification or termination of an existing lease  such actions may require payment of exit fees and or result in fixed asset impairment charges  the amounts of which could be material 
in addition  our retail store and restaurant leases generally grant the third party landlord with discretion on a number of operational matters  such as store hours and construction of our improvements 
the recent consolidation within the commercial real estate development  operation and or management industries may further reduce our leverage with those parties  thereby materially adversely affecting the terms of future leases for our retail stores and restaurants or making entering into long term commitments with such parties cost prohibitive 
during fiscal  we opened new tommy bahama retail stores in various jurisdictions in asia and also began operating stores in australia  and we anticipate continuing to expand our tommy bahama international operations in fiscal  these efforts may not be successful 
during fiscal  we opened three tommy bahama retail stores in asia and acquired the tommy bahama business in australia  including five retail stores  from our former licensee 
we continue to look for additional locations for retail stores in the asia australia markets and expect to open two retail stores  including a tommy bahama island  in tokyo and a new retail store in sydney  australia during fiscal the continued development of our tommy bahama international infrastructure and related store openings has had  and will continue to have  a negative impact on our operating results until we are able to generate sufficient sales in those operations to offset the ongoing infrastructure costs 
expanding our operations internationally requires significant capital investment and long term commitments  and there are risks associated with doing business in these markets  including understanding fashion trends and satisfying consumer tastes  including understanding sizing and fitting in these markets  market acceptance of our products  which is difficult to assess immediately  establishing appropriate logistics functions and operational infrastructure  managing compliance with the various legal requirements  staffing and managing foreign operations  fluctuations in exchange rates  obtaining governmental approvals that may be required to operate  potentially adverse tax implications  local regulations relating to employment and retail and restaurant operations  and maintaining proper levels of inventory 
if we are unable to properly manage these risks or if our international expansion efforts do not prove successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our geographical concentration of retail stores and wholesale customers for certain of our products exposes us to certain regional risks 
our retail locations are heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas in the united states  including florida and california for our tommy bahama retail stores out of domestic stores in these states as of february   florida for our lilly pulitzer retail stores five out of stores as 
table of contents of february   and the united kingdom for our ben sherman retail stores out of stores as of february  
additionally  a significant portion of our wholesale sales for tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman products are concentrated in the same geographic areas as our own retail store locations for these brands 
due to this concentration  we have heightened exposure to factors that impact these regions  including general economic conditions  weather patterns  natural disasters  changing demographics and other factors 
our internet operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our results and operations 
certain of our brands  including tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman  distribute products through their e commerce websites and communicate with consumers through social media and other methods of digital marketing 
these operations subject us to numerous risks that could adversely affect our results and operations  including diversion of sales from our brick and mortar retail stores  failure to properly communicate our brand message or recreate the ambiance of our retail stores  reliance on third party service providers for software  processing and similar services  liability for website content  credit card fraud  and failure of computer systems  theft of personal consumer information and computer viruses 
if we are unable to properly manage these risks  we may lose sales and or our reputation and credibility may be damaged 
our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
we schedule production from third party manufacturers based on our expectations for the demand for our products 
however  we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory  which may result in inventory markdowns or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices 
these events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands 
conversely  we may not be in a position to order quality products from our manufacturers in a timely manner and or we may experience inventory shortages as demand for our products increases  which might result in unfilled orders  negatively impact customer relationships  diminish brand loyalty and result in lost sales  any of which could harm our business 
our international operations  including foreign sourcing  result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of our international operations  we are exposed to certain risks in conducting business outside of the united states 
substantially all of our orders for the production of apparel in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future  then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase  and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to customers  which would negatively impact our margins 
however  if the value of the us dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product  the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by competitors that pay for goods in local currencies  and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices 
additionally  currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance 
we received us dollars for more than of our product sales during fiscal the sales denominated in foreign currencies primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
as we increase our operations in foreign markets  the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies would be expected to increase 
an increase in the value of the us dollar compared to these other currencies in which we have sales could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of operations  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts in prior periods 
in addition  to the extent that a stronger us dollar increases 
table of contents costs  and the products are sold in another currency  but the additional cost cannot be passed on to our customers  our gross margins will be negatively impacted 
we hold licenses for the use of other parties brand names  and we cannot guarantee our continued use of such brand names or the quality or salability of such brand names 
we have entered into license and design agreements to use certain trademarks and trade names  such as kenneth cole  dockers  geoffrey beene and ike behar  to market some of our products 
during fiscal  sales of products bearing brands licensed to us accounted for of our consolidated net sales and of our lanier clothes net sales 
when we enter into these license and design agreements  they generally provide for short contract durations typically three to five years  these agreements often include options that we may exercise to extend the term of the contract but  when available  those option rights are subject to our satisfaction of certain contingencies eg  minimum sales thresholds that may be difficult for us to satisfy 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other popular trademarks 
the termination or expiration of a license agreement will cause us to lose the sales and any associated profits generated pursuant to such license and in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets 
in addition to certain compliance obligations  all of our significant licenses provide minimum thresholds for royalty payments and advertising expenditures for each license year  which we must pay regardless of the level of our sales of the licensed products 
if these thresholds are not met  our licensors may be permitted contractually to terminate these agreements or seek payment of minimum royalties even if the minimum sales are not achieved 
in addition  our licensors produce their own products and license their trademarks to other third parties  and we are unable to control the quality of these goods that others produce 
if licensors or others do not maintain the quality of these trademarks or if the brand image deteriorates  our sales and any associated profits generated by such brands may decline 
we make use of debt to finance our operations  which exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business  financial position and operating results 
our levels of debt vary as a result of the seasonality of our business  investments in our operations and working capital needs 
as of february   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our us revolving credit agreement and million in borrowings outstanding under our uk revolving credit agreement 
in the future  our debt levels may increase under our existing facilities or potentially under new facilities  or the terms or forms of our financing arrangements may change 
our indebtedness includes  and any future indebtedness may include  certain obligations and limitations  including the periodic payment of principal and interest  maintenance of certain covenants and certain other limitations 
the negative covenants in our debt agreements limit our ability to incur debt  guaranty certain obligations  incur liens  pay dividends  repurchase common stock  make investments  sell assets  make acquisitions  merge with other companies  or satisfy other debt 
these obligations and limitations may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and limit our flexibility in carrying out our business plan and planning for  or reacting to  changes in the industry in which we operate 
in addition  we have interest rate risk on indebtedness under our us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement 
our exposure to variable rate indebtedness may increase in the future  based on our working capital needs and or the terms of future financing arrangements 
although from time to time we enter into hedging arrangements to limit our exposure to interest rate risk  an increase in interest rates may require us to pay a greater amount of our funds 
table of contents from operations towards interest  even if the amount of borrowings outstanding remains the same 
as a result  we may have to revise or delay our business plans  reduce or delay capital expenditures or otherwise adjust our plans for operations 
our operations may be affected by changes in weather patterns  natural or man made disasters  war  terrorism or other catastrophes 
our sales volume and operations may be adversely affected by severe weather conditions  natural or man made disasters  war  terrorist attacks  including heightened security measures and responsive military actions  or other catastrophes which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations 
because of the seasonality of our business  the concentration of a significant proportion of our retail stores and wholesale customers in certain geographic regions  the concentration of our sourcing operations and the concentration of our distribution operations  the occurrence of such events could disproportionately impact our business  financial condition and operating results

item properties we lease and own space for our retail stores  distribution centers  manufacturing facilities and sales administration office space in various domestic and international locations 
we believe that our existing properties are well maintained  are in good operating condition and will be adequate for our present level of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into lease agreements for retail space 
most of the leases require us to pay specified minimum rent  as well as a portion of operating expenses  real estate taxes and insurance applicable to the property  plus a contingent rent based on a percentage of the store net sales in excess of a specific threshold 
the leases have varying terms and expirations and may have provisions to extend  renew or terminate the lease agreement  among other terms and conditions  as negotiated 
assets leased under operating leases are not recognized as assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
periodically  we assess the operating results of each of our retail stores and restaurants to assess whether the location provides  or is expected to provide  an appropriate long term return on investment  whether the location remains brand appropriate and other factors 
as a result of this assessment  we may determine that it is appropriate to close certain stores that do not continue to meet our investment criteria  not renew certain leases  exercise an early termination option  or otherwise negotiate an early termination 
for existing leases in desirable locations  we anticipate that we will be able to extend our retail leases  to the extent that they expire in the near future  on terms that are satisfactory to us  or if necessary  locate substitute properties on acceptable terms 
we also believe that there are abundant retail spaces available for the continued expansion of our retail store footprint in the near future 
as of february   our retail operations utilized approximately million square feet of leased retail and restaurant space in the united states  the united kingdom  australia  asia and europe 
each of our retail stores and restaurants is less than  square feet  and we do not believe that we are dependent upon any individual retail store or restaurant location for our business operations

table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our operations  cash flows  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
overview we generate revenues and cash flow primarily through our design  sourcing  marketing and distribution of branded apparel products bearing the trademarks of our owned lifestyle brands  as well as certain licensed and private label apparel products 
we distribute our products through our direct to consumer channels  including our retail stores  e commerce sites and restaurants  and our wholesale distribution channel  which includes better department stores  specialty stores  national chains  specialty catalogs  mass merchants and internet retailers 
in fiscal  more than of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the united states  with the remainder primarily being sales of our ben sherman products in the united kingdom and europe 
we source substantially all of our products through third party manufacturers located outside of the united states and united kingdom 
our business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that are fashion right and evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers 
we strive to exploit the potential of our existing brands and products domestically and internationally and  as suitable opportunities arise  we may acquire additional lifestyle brands that we believe fit within our business model 
we believe that lifestyle branded products that create an emotional connection with our target consumers can command greater customer loyalty and higher price points at retail  resulting in higher earnings 
we also believe a successful lifestyle brand opens up greater opportunities for direct to consumer and licensing operations 
we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets in which numerous us based and foreign apparel firms compete 
no single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms  dominate the apparel industry and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation  value and image of brand names  design  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing  and customer service 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is directly related to our proficiency in foreseeing changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference  and presenting appealing products for consumers 
in some instances  a retailer that is our customer may compete directly with us by offering certain of their own competing products  some of which may be sourced directly by our customer  in their own retail stores 
additionally  the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
often  negative economic conditions have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel and retail industry than the conditions have on other industries 
we believe the global economic conditions and resulting economic uncertainty that has prevailed in recent years continue to impact each of our operating groups  and the apparel industry as a whole 
although some signs of economic improvements exist in the united states  unemployment levels remain high  the retail environment remains very promotional and economic uncertainty remains 
further  the economies of the united kingdom and europe  which are important to our ben sherman operating group  continue to struggle more than the economy in the united states 
we anticipate sales of our products may continue to be negatively impacted as long as there is an elevated level of economic uncertainty 
additionally  fiscal and fiscal were impacted by pricing pressures on raw materials  fuel  transportation  labor and other costs necessary for the production and sourcing of apparel products 
we believe that our tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer lifestyle brands have significant opportunities for long term growth in their direct to consumer businesses through expansion of our 
table of contents retail store operations as we add additional retail store locations and with increases in same store and e commerce sales  with e commerce likely to grow at a faster rate than retail store operations 
we also believe that these lifestyle brands provide an opportunity for moderate sales increases in their wholesale businesses in the long term primarily from our current customers adding to their existing door count and the selective addition of new wholesale customers 
we believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long term growth for the brands  we must continue to invest in our tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer lifestyle brands 
we believe that the tailored clothing environment will continue to be very challenging  with competition and costing pressures negatively impacting operating income in lanier clothes in the near term 
the ben sherman lifestyle brand currently faces challenges due to our ongoing elevation of the distribution of the brand  the sluggish economic conditions in the united kingdom and europe and missteps in the merchandise mix in our own retail stores in the second half of fiscal we believe that in the long term ben sherman will have opportunities to improve its operating results if the elevation of the brand is successful and the economic conditions in the united kingdom and europe improve 
we continue to believe that it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity 
we believe that our positive cash flow from operations coupled with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity will provide us ample resources to fund future investments in our lifestyle brands 
in the future  we may add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio  if we identify appropriate targets which meet our investment criteria  however  we believe that we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands 
the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results in thousands  except per share amounts for the week fiscal compared to the week fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales operating income earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations per diluted share net earnings net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations the primary reasons for the improvement in earnings from continuing operations were an increase in net sales in both the tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer operating groups as well as the impact of fiscal being a week year  a reduction in interest expense in fiscal to million due to our borrowing at lower interest rates in the second half of fiscal compared to the second half of fiscal due to our july redemption of the remaining million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes due in senior secured notes and the reduction in our average debt levels during the first half of fiscal compared to the first half of fiscal primarily as a result of our repurchase of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes during the second and third quarters of fiscal  and fiscal not having purchase accounting charges while fiscal included purchase accounting charges of million 
these items were partially offset by a decrease in sales and operating results at both ben sherman and lanier clothes  
table of contents an increase in sg a  which was primarily due to the sg a associated with pre opening expenses of retail stores and the operation of retail stores opened in fiscal and fiscal  including our tommy bahama new york location  certain infrastructure  pre opening retail store rent and other costs related to the tommy bahama international expansion  higher sg a to support the growing tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer businesses and higher sg a due to fiscal being a week year while fiscal was a week year  a million charge in fiscal related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration compared to a million charge in fiscal with the increase resulting from our determination of a higher fair value of the obligation due to our assessment that the certainty of the payment of the contingent consideration related to the lilly pulitzer acquisition is more probable than we had determined in prior years  and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal primarily due to our inability to recognize the income tax benefit of certain losses in foreign jurisdictions and having a greater proportion of our earnings in higher tax jurisdictions  which offset the impact of certain favorable discrete items in that period 
in fiscal  we were able to recognize the income tax benefit of foreign jurisdiction losses as well as the impact of certain favorable discrete items 
earnings from discontinued operations reflect the operations related to substantially all of our former oxford apparel operating group  which we sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal we do not anticipate significant operating income loss or cash flows associated with discontinued operations subsequent to fiscal amendment and restatement of the us revolving credit agreement on june   we entered into the us revolving credit agreement  which provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million which may be used to refinance existing debt  to redeem our previously outstanding senior secured notes  to fund working capital  to fund future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
the us revolving credit agreement amended and restated the prior revolving credit agreement  as defined in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report and which was entered into on august  and was scheduled to mature in august we believe that the covenants in the us revolving credit agreement are generally less restrictive and provide greater flexibility than those contained in the prior revolving credit agreement 
in addition  the us revolving credit agreement allows us to include in our borrowing base certain amounts attributable to eligible trademarks  which amounts would not have been available for inclusion in the borrowing base under the prior revolving credit agreement 
the material terms of the us revolving credit agreement are described in note in our consolidated financial statements and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  both contained in this report 
senior secured notes redemption and repurchase on july   we redeemed all of the outstanding million in principal amount of the senior secured notes  which were scheduled to mature in july the redemption of the senior secured notes at a premium of million and the write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized bond discount resulted in a loss on repurchase of senior notes of million 
the redemption of the senior secured notes satisfied and discharged all of our obligations with respect to the senior secured notes and the related indenture and was funded through borrowings under our us revolving credit agreement and cash on hand 

table of contents during the second quarter and third quarters of fiscal  we repurchased  in privately negotiated transactions  million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes for million  plus accrued interest  using cash on hand 
the repurchase of the senior secured notes and related write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs and discount resulted in a loss on repurchase of senior notes of million in fiscal operating groups our business is primarily operated through our four operating groups tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer  lanier clothes and ben sherman 
we identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance 
our operating group structure reflects a brand focused management approach  emphasizing operational coordination and resource allocation across the brand direct to consumer  wholesale and licensing operations

for further information regarding our operating groups  see note to our consolidated financial statements and part i  item  business  both included in this report 
comparable store sales we often disclose comparable store sales in order to provide additional information regarding changes in our results of operations between periods 
historically  our disclosures of comparable store sales have only included sales at our full price retail stores  however  beginning with the full fiscal year our disclosures include sales from our full price stores and our e commerce sites  excluding sales associated with e commerce flash clearance sales 
we believe that given the similar nature and process of inventory planning  allocation and return policy  as well as our cross channel marketing and other initiatives  for the direct to consumer channel  the inclusion of our e commerce sites in the comparable store sales disclosures is a more meaningful way of reporting our comparable store sales results 
further  we believe that this change better aligns our disclosures with other companies within our industry 
additionally  for our comparable store sales disclosures  we exclude outlet store sales and amounts related to e commerce flash clearance sales  as those sales are used primarily to liquidate end of season inventory  which may vary significantly depending on the level of end of season inventory on hand and generally occurs at lower gross margins than our full price direct to consumer sales 
also  our comparable store sales metrics exclude restaurant sales as we do not believe that the inclusion of restaurant sales would be meaningful in assessing our consolidated operations 
thus  the comparable store metrics disclosed by us reflect comparable full price retail stores and e commerce sites  excluding e commerce flash clearance sales  in total  unless specified otherwise 
for purposes of our disclosures  we consider a comparable store to be  in addition to our e commerce sites  a physical full price retail store that was owned and open as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year and which did not during the relevant periods  and is not within the current fiscal year scheduled to  have a remodel resulting in the store being closed for an extended period of time which we define as a period of two weeks or longer  a greater than change in the size of the retail space due to expansion  reduction or relocation to a new retail space or a relocation to a new space that was significantly different from the prior retail space 
for those stores which are excluded from comparable stores based on the preceding sentence  we treat those stores as new store openings 
generally  a store that is remodeled will continue to be included in our comparable store metrics as a store is not typically closed for a two week period during a remodel 
however  a store that is relocated generally will not be included in our comparable store metrics until that store has been open in the relocated space for the entirety of the prior fiscal year as the size or other characteristics of the store typically change significantly from the prior location 
additionally  any stores that were closed during the prior fiscal year or which we plan to close or vacate in the current fiscal year are excluded from the definition of comparable stores 
definitions and calculations of comparable store sales differ among companies in the retail industry  and therefore comparable store metrics disclosed by us may not be comparable to the metrics disclosed by other companies

net sales fiscal fiscal change change tommy bahama lilly pulitzer lanier clothes ben sherman corporate and other total net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  in fiscal  which included weeks  compared to fiscal  which included weeks  primarily due to the increase in net sales at tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer  which were partially offset by decreased net sales at lanier clothes and ben sherman  each as discussed below 

table of contents tommy bahama the tommy bahama sales increase of million  or  was primarily driven by an increase in comparable store sales of million  to million in the week fiscal compared to million in the week fiscal  a net sales increase of million associated with domestic retail stores and outlet stores opened in fiscal and fiscal  a wholesale sales increase of million and a net sales increase associated with our tommy bahama international operations in australia and asia of million 
the remaining sales increase primarily related to sales in our restaurants and our outlet stores opened for all of fiscal and fiscal tommy bahama apparel unit sales increased by due to the higher volume in each distribution channel  and the average selling price per unit increased by as sales in the direct to consumer channel of distribution  which generally have a higher sales price per unit than wholesale sales  represented a greater proportion of tommy bahama sales in fiscal as of february   tommy bahama operated retail stores compared to retail stores as of january  lilly pulitzer the lilly pulitzer sales increase of million  or  was primarily driven by an increase in comparable store sales of million  to million in the week fiscal compared to million in the week fiscal  a wholesale sales increase of million  a net sales increase of million associated with e commerce flash sales in fiscal and a net sales increase of million reflecting the net sales impact of the four retail stores opened in fiscal  net of the impact of the one store closure in fiscal these sales increases were partially offset by a decrease in the clearance warehouse sales in fiscal  as more end of season product was sold through the e commerce flash sales 
the e commerce flash sales generated million of net sales in fiscal compared to million of net sales in fiscal lilly pulitzer apparel unit sales increased by due to the higher volume in each distribution channel  while the average selling price per unit decreased by 
the decreased selling price per unit primarily resulted from a change in product mix as sportswear and knit dresses  both of which generally sell at lower price points than woven dresses  represented a greater proportion of the lilly pulitzer business during fiscal as of february   lilly pulitzer operated retail stores compared to retail stores as of january  lanier clothes the decrease in net sales for lanier clothes of million  or  was primarily due to the decrease in private label sales of million partially offset by an increase in branded sales of million 
the decrease in private label sales was primarily due to fiscal benefitting from initial shipments related to a new product launch  while fiscal sales were negatively impacted by a slow down of the inventory intake on a replenishment program by a key customer as well as the exit from certain underperforming private label programs 
in addition to higher branded sales generally  fiscal also benefitted from certain spring merchandise shipping in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which would have typically shipped in the first quarter of fiscal overall  the decrease in net sales resulted from a decrease in unit sales partially offset by a increase in average selling price per unit 
the increase in average selling price per unit was primarily due to a change in sales mix with more branded sales  which typically sell at higher prices per unit than private label sales  in fiscal the sales for lanier clothes were also negatively impacted by the continuing competitive factors in tailored clothing business 
ben sherman net sales for ben sherman decreased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million decline in wholesale sales  which was predominantly in united 
table of contents kingdom  with direct to consumer net sales being comparable in fiscal and fiscal  which was primarily due to higher e commerce sales as well as the impact of additional stores 
the decrease in net sales for ben sherman was primarily driven by a reduction in unit volume of primarily attributable to our exit from certain wholesale accounts with moderate priced stores in the united kingdom and the difficult economic conditions that persist in the united kingdom and europe 
further  the direct to consumer operations of ben sherman were negatively impacted by missteps in ben sherman merchandise assortment planning in the second half of fiscal  which  particularly in the current economic environment  resulted in too much of the product offering in styles at the higher end of the price range and resulted in more promotions in our retail stores in order to sell inventory on hand 
the reduction in units sold was partially offset by an increase in the average selling price per unit of 
the increase in average selling price per unit was primarily due to a greater proportion of ben sherman sales being direct to consumer sales  which generally have higher selling prices than wholesale sales 
these items that positively impacted average selling price per unit were partially offset by a less than unfavorable foreign currency translation change in the average exchange rates between the two periods 
corporate and other corporate and other net sales primarily consisted of the net sales of our oxford golf business and our lyons  georgia distribution center 
the increase in the net sales for corporate and other was primarily driven by the higher net sales in our oxford golf business during fiscal gross profit the first table below presents gross profit by operating group and in total for fiscal and fiscal as well as the change between those two periods

table of contents discussed above 
additionally  gross profit was also impacted by the changes in gross margin by operating group  as discussed below 
on a consolidated basis  the increase in gross margins from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to a million net favorable impact in fiscal resulting from a lower lifo charge in fiscal  a million charge resulting from purchase accounting negatively impacting the lilly pulitzer gross margins in fiscal with no such charge in fiscal and changes in the sales mix 
the changes in sales mix included direct to consumer sales  which generally have higher gross margins than wholesale sales  making up a larger proportion of both the tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer sales during fiscal the change in sales mix was also attributable to tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer  which typically have higher gross margins than our other operating groups  representing a greater proportion of our consolidated net sales 
these items  which positively impacted gross margins  were partially offset by the negative impact on our gross profit and gross margin of product cost pressures that impacted our operating groups and gross margin pressures at ben sherman and lanier clothes 
the gross margin at tommy bahama for fiscal and fiscal reflects a decrease in gross margins in the first half of fiscal compared to the prior year and improved gross margins in the second half of fiscal compared to the prior year 
tommy bahama increased prices in the first half of fiscal in anticipation of increased product costs  which began to impact our results in the second half of fiscal and continued into fiscal this negative gross margin pressure for fiscal was partially offset by a change in the proportion of sales in each distribution channel as sales in the direct to consumer distribution channel  which typically have higher gross margins than the wholesale distribution channel  increased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal as we expect to continue to expand our direct to consumer operations at a faster pace than our wholesale operations  we anticipate that gross margins for tommy bahama will increase slightly in the future with the change in sales mix 
the increase in gross margin for lilly pulitzer from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the proportion of sales in each distribution channel as sales in the direct to consumer channel  which typically have higher gross margins than the wholesale distribution channel  increased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal and fiscal including a million purchase accounting charge  with no such charge in fiscal as we expect to continue to expand our direct to consumer operations at a faster pace than our wholesale operations  we anticipate that gross margins for lilly pulitzer will increase in the future with the change in sales mix 
the decrease in gross margin at lanier clothes was primarily the result of gross margin pressures  including both competitive factors and higher product costs that continue to impact the tailored clothing business 
the decrease in gross margin at ben sherman reflects higher product costs during fiscal  the competitive factors resulting from the difficult economic conditions that persist in the united kingdom and europe  heavier promotions in the direct to consumer business  a greater amount off price sales and more significant inventory markdowns 
the heavier promotions and the higher off price sales and inventory markdowns  which were necessary measures to appropriately manage inventory levels in the economic environment  were more significant in the second half of fiscal  in part due to the merchandising mix miss in the second half of fiscal the gross profit in corporate and other in each period primarily reflects the impact on gross profit of our oxford golf and lyons  georgia distribution center operations offset by the impact of lifo accounting adjustments  which included significant charges in both fiscal and fiscal the lifo accounting charge was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our gross profit and gross margin may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors  as statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company

change in fair value of contingent consideration fiscal fiscal change change change in fair value of contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations in fiscal  we entered into a contingent consideration agreement with the sellers  under which we are obligated to pay certain contingent consideration amounts based on the achievement of certain performance criteria by our lilly pulitzer operating group  which payments may be as much as million in the aggregate over the four years subsequent to acquisition 
in accordance with gaap  we have recognized a liability in our consolidated balance sheets for the fair value of this liability at each balance sheet date 
generally  this liability increases in fair value as we approach the date of anticipated payment  resulting in a charge to our consolidated statements of earnings during that period 
further  if we determine that the probability of the amounts being earned changes  it would impact our assessment of the fair value in our consolidated balance sheet  resulting in a charge or income in our consolidated statement of earnings at that time 
during fiscal  we increased the fair value of the contingent consideration by million to reflect not only the passage of time  but also our determination that the certainty of the payment of the contingent consideration related to the lilly pulitzer acquisition is more probable than we had determined in prior years based on our consideration of  among other things  the fiscal and fiscal operating results of the lilly pulitzer operating group  projected operating results for lilly pulitzer for fiscal and fiscal  the operating results criteria for the fiscal and fiscal amounts to be earned and the shorter remaining term of the contingent consideration agreement

income taxes fiscal fiscal change change income taxes effective tax rate income tax expense for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher earnings in fiscal as well as an increase in the effective tax rate 
income taxes for fiscal were impacted by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we were not able to recognize an income tax benefit and a greater proportion of our earnings being in jurisdictions with higher tax rates  which was offset by favorable discrete items during the period  including the reduction in income tax contingency reserves by million related to the expiration of the corresponding statute of limitations  the impact of a change in our assertion of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings  and a reduction in enacted tax rates in certain jurisdictions 
income taxes for fiscal were impacted by certain favorable discrete items  including the reduction of income tax contingency reserves upon the expiration of the corresponding statute of limitations  favorable permanent differences and tax credits which do not necessarily fluctuate with earnings and a reduction in enacted tax rates in certain jurisdictions  as well as the recognition of an income tax benefit for losses in foreign jurisdictions 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will be higher than the effective tax rate in fiscal as our foreign losses in future periods will likely not provide a tax benefit in the near term  and we likely will not benefit from certain discrete items to the degree we did in fiscal net earnings fiscal fiscal earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share weighted average common shares outstanding diluted the increase in earnings from continuing operations for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher sales in tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer  lower interest expense due to lower borrowings and lower interest rates in fiscal and no purchase accounting adjustments 
table of contents in fiscal  each as discussed above 
these items were partially offset by lower sales and operating results at lanier clothes and ben sherman  higher sg a in tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer to support the continued growth and expansion of these brands  a more significant charge for change in fair value of contingent consideration in fiscal  and a higher effective tax rate during fiscal  each as discussed above

net sales fiscal fiscal change change tommy bahama lilly pulitzer    nm lanier clothes ben sherman corporate and other total net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the net sales related to the lilly pulitzer business and the increase in net sales at tommy bahama  each as discussed below 
tommy bahama the million increase in net sales for tommy bahama was primarily driven by increased increased comparable store sales  which includes sales of our full price retail stores and our e commerce sites of million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a net sales increase of million for stores opened in fiscal and fiscal and a net sales increase of million in our wholesale business 
additionally  restaurant sales and sales at outlet stores opened for all of fiscal and fiscal also increased in fiscal tommy bahama unit sales increased due to the higher volume in each distribution channel  and the average selling price per unit increased  primarily as a result of the higher proportion of net sales from the direct to consumer channel of distribution and higher product sales prices generally as certain product cost increases were recovered from consumers 
as of january   tommy bahama operated retail stores compared to retail stores as of january  lilly pulitzer we acquired the lilly pulitzer brand and operations on december  therefore  our consolidated operating results for the first months of fiscal did not include any operating activities for lilly pulitzer 
net sales for lilly pulitzer for fiscal were million 
by way of comparison  the lilly pulitzer brand and operations generated million of net sales during fiscal  of which only million was included in our consolidated operating results 
the increase of million in net sales from that generated by the lilly pulitzer brand in fiscal to lilly pulitzer sales in fiscal reflects increases in each channel of distribution  consisting of a million increase in wholesale sales  a million increase in e commerce sales and a million increase in retail store sales 
during fiscal we operated lilly pulitzer retail stores  compared to 
table of contents the operation of lilly pulitzer retail stores in fiscal with three of the retail stores being closed prior to the start of fiscal lanier clothes the increase in net sales for lanier clothes was primarily due to million in increased net sales in branded tailored clothing products  which was partially offset by a million decline in private label sales 
the average selling price per unit increased as a result of the change in sales mix as our branded tailored clothing products  which typically have a higher average selling price than our private label products  represented a greater percentage of net sales for lanier clothes in fiscal a decrease in unit sales of was primarily driven by the decreased sales in the private label businesses  which was partially offset by an increase in unit sales of branded tailored clothing products 
ben sherman net sales for ben sherman in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal primarily due to a million increase in retail sales  with the majority of the increase in retail sales resulting from higher comparable retail store sales and the remainder being increased sales at outlet stores and new retail stores 
the net sales for fiscal reflect an increase in the average selling price per unit of  which was partially offset by a decrease in unit volume of 
the increase in average selling price per unit was due to our strategy to improve the wholesale distribution of the brand  a greater proportion of ben sherman total sales being retail sales  which generally have higher selling prices  during fiscal  the favorable foreign currency translation impact of a change in average exchange rates between the two periods and the million of net sales associated with the previously exited women and footwear businesses  much of which was sold at close out prices in fiscal with no such sales in fiscal the reduced unit volume was primarily the result of our continuing strategy to improve the wholesale distribution of the brand  as reduced unit sales to certain moderate department stores have not yet been replaced with sales to targeted upper tier retailers  as well as the lack of close out sales associated with our previously exited women and footwear businesses in fiscal corporate and other corporate and other net sales primarily consisted of the net sales of our oxford golf business and our lyons  georgia distribution center

the increase in gross margin at tommy bahama was primarily due to a change in sales mix with direct to consumer sales  which generally have a higher gross margin  representing a greater proportion of tommy bahama net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal operating results for lilly pulitzer only included six weeks of activity 
therefore  gross margins for lilly pulitzer have not been provided for fiscal as they would not be meaningful for purposes of a year to year comparison 
the gross profit and gross margin for lilly pulitzer for fiscal and fiscal were negatively impacted by million and million  respectively  of charges to cost of goods sold resulting from the write up of acquired inventory to fair value pursuant to the purchase method of accounting in connection with the sale of the acquired inventory 
the decrease in gross margin at lanier clothes was primarily the result of the gross margin pressures  including competitive factors and higher product costs 
the decrease in gross margin at ben sherman reflects gross margin erosion resulting from higher product costs  which in most cases were not passed on to ben sherman customers 
the gross profit in corporate and other in each period primarily reflects the impact on gross profit of our oxford golf and lyons  georgia distribution center offset by the impact of lifo accounting  which included significant charges in both fiscal and fiscal on a consolidated basis  the increase in gross margins was primarily due to changes in the sales mix in fiscal compared to fiscal the changes in sales mix included the inclusion of lilly pulitzer operating results for a full year in fiscal  and direct to consumer sales making up a larger proportion of tommy bahama sales 
these items  which positively impacted gross margins  were partially offset by the negative impact on our gross profit and gross margin of the net impact of lifo accounting  which included million of charges in fiscal compared to million of charges in fiscal  and gross margin declines in lanier clothes and ben sherman in fiscal our gross profit and gross margin may not be directly comparable to those of our competitors  as statement of operations classification of certain expenses may vary by company

change in fair value of contingent consideration fiscal fiscal change change change in fair value of contingent consideration   nm in connection with the acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we entered into a contingent consideration agreement with the sellers  whereby we will be obligated to pay certain contingent consideration amounts based on the achievement of certain performance criteria by our lilly pulitzer operating group  which may be as much as million in the aggregate over the four years subsequent to the acquisition 
in accordance with gaap  we have recognized a liability in our consolidated balance sheets for the fair value of this liability 
this liability increases in fair value as we approach the date of anticipated payment  resulting in a charge to our consolidated statements of earnings during that period 
thus  the amounts reflected in our statements of earnings reflect the change in fair value of the contingent consideration obligations 
prior to the acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we did not have any contingent consideration arrangements requiring adjustment to fair value 
the increase in change in fair value of contingent consideration was due to fiscal including a full year  whereas  fiscal only included a six week period

the fiscal operating results were negatively impacted by million of charges in the first quarter to cost of goods sold resulting from the write up of acquired inventory to fair value pursuant to the purchase method of accounting in connection with the sale of acquired inventory 
gaap requires that all assets acquired as part of an acquisition  including inventory  be recorded at fair value  rather than its original cost 
this write up was recognized as an increase to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold in the ordinary course of business

key liquidity measures in thousands february  january  change change current assets current liabilities working capital working capital ratio debt to total capital ratio our working capital ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities

debt was million at february  and million at january   while shareholders equity was million at february  and million at january  the comparable debt to total capital ratio at february  and january  reflects an increase in debt  but also an increase in shareholders equity 
the increase in debt was primarily due to million of capital expenditures incurred in fiscal  million of dividends paid on our common stock  million premium required to redeem our senior secured notes in the second quarter of fiscal and million of payments related to the lilly pulitzer contingent consideration arrangement  which in the aggregate exceeded the million of cash flows from operations during fiscal our debt levels and ratio of debt to total capital in future periods may not be comparable to historical amounts as we continue to assess  and possibly make changes to  our capital structure

as of february   million of trade letters of credit and other limitations on availability in the aggregate were outstanding against our credit facilities 
after considering these limitations and the amount of eligible assets in our borrowing base  as applicable  as of february   we had million and million in unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement and the us revolving credit agreement  respectively  subject to the respective limitations on borrowings set forth in the us revolving credit agreement and the uk revolving credit agreement 
covenants and other restrictions our credit facilities  consisting of our us revolving credit agreement and our uk revolving credit agreement  are subject to a number of affirmative covenants regarding the delivery of financial information  compliance with law  maintenance of property  insurance and conduct of business 
also  our credit facilities are subject to certain negative covenants or other restrictions including  among other things  limitations on our ability to i incur debt  ii guaranty certain obligations  iii incur liens  iv pay dividends to shareholders  v repurchase shares of our common stock  vi make investments  vii sell assets or stock of subsidiaries  viii acquire assets or businesses  ix merge or consolidate with other companies  or x prepay  retire  repurchase or redeem debt 
our us revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant that applies if unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement for three consecutive days is less than the greater of i million or ii of the total revolving commitments 
in such case  our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the us revolving credit agreement must not be less than to for the immediately preceding fiscal months for which financial statements have been delivered 
this financial covenant continues to apply until we have maintained unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement of more than the greater of i million or ii of the total revolving commitments for consecutive days 
we believe that the affirmative covenants  negative covenants  financial covenants and other restrictions under our credit facilities are customary for those included in similar facilities entered into at the time we entered into our agreements 
during fiscal and as of february   no financial covenant testing was required pursuant to our us revolving credit agreement as the minimum availability threshold was met at all times 
as of february   we were compliant with all covenants related to our credit facilities 
redemption and repurchase of senior notes during the second quarter and third quarters of fiscal  we repurchased  in privately negotiated transactions  million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes for million  plus accrued interest  using cash on hand 
the repurchase of the senior secured notes and related write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs and discount resulted in a loss on repurchase of senior notes of million in fiscal in the second quarter of  we 
table of contents redeemed all of the remaining outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes  which were scheduled to mature in july the redemption of the senior secured notes at a premium of million and the write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized bond discount resulted in a loss on repurchase of senior notes of million 
the redemption of the senior secured notes was funded through borrowings under our us revolving credit agreement and cash on hand and satisfied and discharged all of our obligations with respect to the senior secured notes 
other liquidity items we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements  which generally consist of working capital and other operating activity needs  capital expenditures  interest payments on our debt and dividends  if any  primarily from positive cash flow from operations supplemented by cash on hand and borrowings under our lines of credit  if necessary 
our need for working capital is typically seasonal with the greatest requirements generally existing in the fall and spring of each year 
our capital needs will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the need to finance inventory levels and the success of our various products 
we anticipate that at the maturity of any of our financing arrangements or as otherwise deemed appropriate  we will be able to refinance the facilities and debt with terms available in the market at that time  which may or may not be as favorable as the terms of the current agreements or current market terms 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations  as of february   by future period in thousands payments due by period less than year years years more than years total contractual obligations us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement operating leases minimum royalty and advertising payments pursuant to royalty agreements letters of credit contingent purchase price consideration other total principal and interest amounts payable in future periods on our us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement have been excluded from the table above  as the amount that will be outstanding and interest rate during any fiscal year will be dependent upon future events which are not known at this time 
as of february   million was outstanding under our us revolving credit agreement  which matures in june  and million was outstanding under our uk revolving credit agreement  which is payable on demand 
amounts to be paid in future periods for real estate taxes  insurance  other operating expenses and contingent rent applicable to the properties pursuant to the respective operating leases have been excluded from the table above  as the amounts payable in future periods are generally not quantified in the lease agreements and are dependent on factors which are not known at this time 
such amounts incurred in fiscal totaled million 

table of contents amounts reflected in the table reflect the maximum amount payable pursuant to a contingent consideration arrangement associated with the lilly pulitzer acquisition  which totaled million as of february  amounts are payable if certain performance criteria related to the acquired business are met during fiscal and fiscal as of february   our consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability of million associated with this arrangement  which is included in non current contingent consideration and reflects the fair value of the anticipated payments as of that date 
amounts totaling million of deferred compensation obligations and obligations related to the postretirement benefit portions of endorsement type split dollar life insurance policies  which are included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of february   have been excluded from the table above  due to the uncertainty of the timing of the payment of these obligations  which are generally at the discretion of the individual employees or upon the death of the individual  respectively 
an environmental reserve liability of million  which is included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  has been excluded from the above table  as we were not contractually obligated to incur these costs as of february  and the timing of payment is uncertain 
non current deferred tax liabilities of million included in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been excluded from the above table  as deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
as the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities by period could be misleading 
our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal  which are excluded from the table above as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts as of february   are expected to be approximately million 
these expenditures are expected to consist primarily of costs associated with opening new retail stores  retail store and restaurant remodeling and information technology initiatives  including e commerce enhancements 
dividend declaration on march   our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share payable on may  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on april  although we have paid dividends in each quarter since we became a public company in july  we may discontinue or modify dividend payments at any time if we determine that other uses of our capital  including payment of outstanding debt  repurchases of outstanding shares  funding of acquisitions or funding of capital expenditures  may be in our best interest  if our expectations of future cash flows and future cash needs outweigh the ability to pay a dividend  or if the terms of our credit facilities  other debt instruments  contingent consideration arrangements or applicable law limit our ability to pay dividends 
we may borrow to fund dividends in the short term based on our expectation of operating cash flows in future periods subject to the terms and conditions of our credit facilities or other debt instruments and applicable law 
all cash flow from operations will not necessarily be paid out as dividends in all periods 
for details about limitations on our ability to pay dividends  see note of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report and the discussion of our credit facilities above 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into agreements which meet the sec definition of an off balance sheet financing arrangement  other than operating leases  and have made no financial commitments to or guarantees with respect to any unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivables  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and other accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that we have appropriately applied our critical accounting policies 
however  in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were used relating to the critical accounting policies below  our consolidated statements of earnings could be misstated 
the detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies  estimates and methods we use 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenue consists of direct to consumer sales  which includes retail store  e commerce  restaurant and concession sales  as well as wholesale sales 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
retail store  e commerce  restaurant and concession revenues are recognized at the time of sale to consumers  which is considered the time of shipment for e commerce sales  as we believe the criteria for revenue recognition are met at the time of sale 
retail store  e commerce  restaurant and concession revenues are recorded net of estimated returns  as appropriate  and net of applicable sales taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings 
as direct to consumer products may be returned in future periods after the date of original purchase by the consumer  we must make estimates of reserves for products which were sold prior to the balance sheet date but that we anticipate may be returned by the consumer subsequent to that date 
the determination of direct to consumer return reserve amounts requires judgment and consideration of historical and current trends  evaluation of current economic trends and other factors 
our historical estimates of direct to consumer return reserves have not differed materially from actual results 
as of february   our direct to consumer return reserve was million 
a change in the direct to consumer return reserve as of february  would have had a million pre tax impact on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal for sales within our wholesale operations  we consider a submitted purchase order or some form of electronic communication from the customer requesting shipment of the goods to be persuasive evidence of an agreement and the products are generally considered sold and delivered at the time that the products are shipped  as substantially all products are sold based on fob shipping point terms 
in certain cases in which we retain risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 

table of contents in the normal course of business we offer certain discounts or allowances to our wholesale customers 
wholesale operations sales are recorded net of such discounts and allowances  as well as advertising support not specifically relating to the reimbursement for actual advertising expenses by our customers  operational chargebacks and provisions for estimated returns 
as certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season  program or other event which may not have occurred yet  we estimate such discounts and allowances on an ongoing basis 
significant considerations in determining our estimates for discounts  returns  allowances and operational chargebacks for wholesale customers include historical and current trends  agreements with customers  projected seasonal results  an evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer performance 
actual discounts and allowances to our wholesale customers have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods 
as of february   our total reserves for discounts and allowances for our wholesale businesses were million and  therefore  if the allowances changed by it would have had a pre tax impact of million on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal in circumstances where we become aware of a specific wholesale customer inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken as a reduction to accounts receivable to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other wholesale customers  we recognize estimated reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience  the financial condition of our customers  an evaluation of current economic conditions and anticipated trends  each of which is subjective and requires certain assumptions 
actual charges for uncollectible amounts have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods 
as of february   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  and therefore  if the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by it would have had a pre tax impact of million on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal inventories  net for operating group reporting  inventory is carried at the lower of the first in  first out fifo method cost or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories for identification of distressed inventory 
in performing this evaluation we consider slow turning products  prior seasons fashion products and current levels of replenishment program products as compared to future sales estimates 
for direct to consumer inventory  we provide an allowance for goods expected to be sold below cost and shrinkage 
for wholesale inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods as necessary 
as the amount to be ultimately realized for the goods is not necessarily known at period end  we must utilize certain assumptions that take into consideration historical experience  the age of the inventory  inventory quantity  quality and mix  historical sales trends  future sales projections  consumer and retailer preferences  market trends and general economic conditions 
for consolidated financial reporting  million of our inventories are valued at the lower of last in  first out lifo method cost or market after deducting the million lifo reserve as of february  the remaining million of our inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market as of february  as of february  and january   and  respectively  of our inventories were accounted for using the lifo method 
generally  our inventories related to our domestic operations are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market and our inventories related to our international operations are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market 
lifo reserves are based on the producer price index as published by the united states department of labor 
we write down inventories valued at the lower of lifo cost or market when lifo exceeds market value 
we consider lifo accounting adjustments to not only include changes in the lifo reserve  but also changes in markdown reserves which are considered in lifo accounting 
lifo inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to our operating groups as lifo inventory pools do not correspond to our operating group definitions 
for operating group reporting purposes included in this report  the impact of lifo accounting is included in corporate and other 

table of contents as of february   we had recorded a reserve of million related to inventory on the lower of fifo cost or market method and for inventory on the lower of lifo cost or market method with markdowns in excess of our lifo reserve 
a change in the amount of markdowns for inventory valued on the lower of fifo cost or market method and markdowns in excess of the lifo reserve as of february  would have a pre tax impact of million on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal a change in the markdowns of our inventory valued at the lower of lifo cost or market method typically would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements after consideration of the existence of our significant lifo reserve of million  or of the fifo cost of the inventory  as of february   as well as the high gross margins historically achieved for the sale of our lifestyle branded products 
a change in inventory levels at the end of future fiscal years compared to inventory balances as of february  could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as such a change may erode portions of our earlier base year layers for purposes of making our annual lifo computation 
additionally  a change in the producer price index as published by the united states department of labor as compared to the indexes as of february  could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as inflation or deflation would change the amount of our lifo reserve 
given the significant amount of uncertainties surrounding the year end lifo calculation  including the estimate of year end inventory balances and year end producer price indexes  we typically do not adjust our lifo reserve in the first three quarters of a fiscal year 
this policy may result in significant lifo accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year resulting from the year over year changes in inventory levels  the producer price index and markdown reserves 
we do recognize on a quarterly basis during the first three quarters of the fiscal year changes in markdown reserves as those amounts can be estimated on a quarterly basis 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires that assets and liabilities  including inventories  are recorded at fair value at acquisition 
in accordance with gaap  the definition of fair value of inventories acquired generally will equal the expected sales price less certain costs associated with selling the inventory  which may exceed the actual cost of producing the acquired inventories 
in accordance with gaap  in connection with our december acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we recognized a write up of inventories of million above the cost of acquired inventories to fair value  which we included in our allocation of purchase price 
based on the inventory turn of the acquired inventories  million of the write up was recognized as additional cost of goods sold in fiscal  and the remaining million of the write up  which was recognized as cost of goods sold during fiscal as the acquired inventory was sold in the ordinary course of business 
in determining the fair value of the acquired inventory  as well as the appropriate period to recognize the charge in our consolidated statements of earnings as the acquired inventory is sold  we must make certain assumptions regarding costs incurred prior to acquisition for the acquired inventory  an appropriate profit allowance  estimates of the costs to sell the inventory and the timing of the sale of the acquired inventory 
such estimates involve significant uncertainty  and if we had made different assumptions  the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be significant 
intangible assets  net intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  totaled million  which includes million of customer relationships and other intangible assets with finite lives and million of trademarks with indefinite lives 
at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consist of trademarks and customer relationships 
the fair values and useful lives of these intangible assets are estimated based on management assessment as well as independent third party appraisals in some cases 
such valuations  which are dependent upon a number of uncertain factors  may include a discounted cash flow analysis 
table of contents of anticipated revenues or cost savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset using an estimate of a risk adjusted market based cost of capital as the discount rate 
the valuation of intangible assets requires significant judgment due to the variety of uncertain factors  including planned use of the intangible assets as well as estimates of net sales  royalty income  operating income  growth rates  royalty rates for the trademarks  discount rates and income tax rates  among other factors 
the use of different assumptions related to these uncertain factors at acquisition could result in a material change to the amounts of intangible assets initially recorded at acquisition  which could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of our december acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we recognized million of intangible assets  including trademarks and customer relationships in our consolidated balance sheet at acquisition using the methodology outlined above 
these acquired intangible assets consist of million of indefinite lived trademarks and million of definite lived customer relationships 
trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of trademarks with indefinite lives includes valuations based on a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the relief from royalty method  among other considerations 
this approach is dependent upon a number of uncertain factors  including those used in the initial valuation of the intangible assets listed above 
such estimates involve significant uncertainty  and if our plans or anticipated results change  the impact on our financial statements could be significant 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of a trademark with an indefinite useful life  the amount of the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
amortization of intangible assets with finite lives  which primarily consist of customer relationships  is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized 
we amortize our intangible assets with finite lives for periods of up to years 
the determination of an appropriate useful life for amortization is based on our plans for the intangible asset as well as factors outside of our control 
intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if expected future undiscounted cash flows from operations are less than their carrying amounts  an asset is determined to be impaired and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
amortization related to intangible assets with finite lives totaled million during fiscal and is anticipated to be approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  no impairment charges related to intangible assets were recognized 
additionally  we do not believe that a change in any of the assumptions utilized in testing our intangible assets for impairment would have resulted in an impairment charge during any of those periods 
goodwill  net goodwill is recognized as the amount by which the cost to acquire a company or group of assets exceeds the fair value of assets acquired less any liabilities assumed at acquisition 
thus  the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination is dependent upon the fair values assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit at the time of acquisition 
as a result of our december acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we allocated million of goodwill to the lilly pulitzer business 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 

table of contents we test  either qualitatively or as a two step evaluation  goodwill for impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
the qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment  as well as to consider if an interim test is appropriate  include a macroeconomic conditions  b industry and market considerations  c cost factors  d overall financial performance  e other relevant entity specific events  f events affecting a reporting unit  g a sustained decrease in share price  or h other factors as appropriate 
in the event we determine that we will bypass the qualitative impairment option or if we determine that a quantitative test is appropriate  the quantitative test includes valuations of each applicable underlying business using fair value techniques and market comparables which may include a discounted cash flow analysis or an independent appraisal 
significant estimates  some of which may be very subjective  considered in such a discounted cash flow analysis are future cash flow projections of the business  the discount rate  which estimates the risk adjusted market based cost of capital  and other assumptions 
the estimates and assumptions included in the two step evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill involve significant uncertainty  and if our plans or anticipated results change  the impact on our financial statements could be significant 
no impairment of goodwill was recognized during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal additionally  we do not believe that a change in any of the assumptions utilized in testing our goodwill for impairment would have resulted in an impairment charge during any of those periods 
income taxes income taxes included in our consolidated financial statements are determined using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income taxes are recognized based on amounts of income taxes payable or refundable in the current year as well as the impact of any items that are recognized in different periods for consolidated financial statement and tax return reporting purposes 
as certain amounts are recognized in different periods for consolidated financial statement and tax return purposes  financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities differ  resulting in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the estimated future tax effects attributable to these differences  as well as the impact of net operating loss  capital loss and federal and state credit carryforwards  each as determined under enacted tax laws and rates expected to apply in the period in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled 
as realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities are dependent upon future taxable jurisdictions  changes in tax laws and rates and shifts in the amount of taxable income among state and foreign jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the amount of benefit ultimately realized for deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we account for the effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment 
there are certain exceptions to the requirement that deferred tax liabilities be recognized for the difference in the financial and tax bases of assets in the case of foreign subsidiaries 
the excess of financial statement over tax basis of an investment in a foreign subsidiary in excess of undistributed earnings is not recognized if management considers the investment to be essentially permanent in duration 
we consider our investments in our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested  and accordingly have not recognized a deferred tax liability for any foreign subsidiary due to a difference in financial and tax basis 
deferred tax liabilities are also not required to be recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries when management considers those earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested outside the us as of february  and therefore have not recorded a deferred tax liability on these earnings 
valuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more likely than not greater than that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur  or circumstances change  that would indicate adjustments to the valuation allowances are appropriate 

table of contents we utilize a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions 
under the two step method  recognition occurs when we conclude that a tax position  based solely on technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement is only addressed if step one has been satisfied 
the tax benefit recorded is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when we subsequently determine that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions are recorded within income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
as a global company  we are subject to income taxes in a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions 
therefore  our income tax provision involves many uncertainties due to not only the timing differences of income for financial statement and tax return reporting  but also the application of complex tax laws and regulations  which are subject to interpretation and management judgment 
the use of different assumptions or a change in our assumptions related to book to tax timing differences  our determination of whether foreign investments or earnings are permanently reinvested  the realizability of uncertain tax positions  the appropriateness of valuation allowances or other considerations  and the jurisdictions or significance of earnings in future periods each could have a significant impact on our income tax rate 
additionally  factors impacting income taxes including changes in tax laws or interpretations  court case decisions  statute of limitation expirations or audit settlements could have a significant impact on our income tax rate 
an increase in our consolidated income tax rate from to during fiscal would have reduced earnings from continuing operations by million 
income tax expense recorded during interim periods is generally based on the expected tax rate for the year  considering projections of earnings and book to tax differences  which are updated and refined throughout the year 
the tax rate ultimately realized for the year may increase or decrease due to actual operating results or book to tax differences varying from our expectations from earlier in the year 
any changes in assumptions related to the need for a valuation allowance  the realizability of an uncertain tax position  changes in enacted tax rates  the expected operating results in total or by jurisdiction for the year  the jurisdictions generating operating income or loss  or other assumptions are accounted for in the period in which the change occurs so that the year to date tax provision reflects the expected annual rate 
as certain of our foreign operations are in a loss position and future losses may not be deductible  a significant variance in losses in such jurisdictions from our expectations can have a very significant impact on our expected annual tax rate 
furthermore  the recognition of the benefit of losses expected to be realized may be limited in an interim period and may require adjustments to tax expense in the interim period that yield an effective tax rate for the interim period that is not representative of the expected tax rate for the year 
fair value measurements for many assets and liabilities the determination of fair value may not require the use of many assumptions or other estimates 
however  in some cases the assumptions or inputs associated with the determination of fair value as of a measurement date may require the use of many assumptions and may be internally derived or otherwise unobservable 
we utilize certain market based and internally derived information and make assumptions about the information in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination  as well as in other circumstances  adjusting previously recorded assets and liabilities to fair value at each balance sheet date  including the 
table of contents fair value of contingent consideration obligations  and assessing recognized assets for impairment  including intangible assets  goodwill and property and equipment 
as part of our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement whereby we may be obligated to pay up to million in cash in the aggregate  over the four years following the closing of the acquisition  based on lilly pulitzer achievement of certain earnings targets 
the terms of the contingent consideration arrangement are discussed in further detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
as of the date of acquisition we determined that the fair value of the contingent consideration was million  which reflected the discounted fair value of the expected payments 
such valuation requires assumptions regarding anticipated cash flows  probabilities of cash flows  discount rates and other factors  which each involve a significant amount of uncertainty 
although there was uncertainty about whether the performance criteria in the contingent consideration arrangement will be achieved  we anticipated paying all of the contingent consideration 
thus  the fair value of the contingent consideration at acquisition reflected the million of anticipated payments discounted to fair value using a discount rate which reflected the uncertainty regarding whether the earnings target may not be met given the growth required to achieve the contingent consideration payments as well as other factors 
subsequent to the date of acquisition  we must periodically adjust the liability for the contingent consideration to reflect the fair value of the contingent consideration by reassessing our valuation assumptions as of that date 
as of january   we still anticipated that the performance criteria would be met based on the operating results of the lilly pulitzer business exceeding the performance criteria in fiscal  and we reevaluated the discount rate at that time 
as of february   we still anticipate that the performance criteria will be met based on the operating results of the lilly pulitzer business exceeding the performance criteria through fiscal further  as of february   we determined that the use of a lower discount rate than used in prior periods would be appropriate 
this lower discount rate reflects our assessment that we believe the likelihood of the contingent consideration being earned is greater than in prior years based on our consideration of  among other factors  the historical earnings achieved by the lilly pulitzer operating group through fiscal  including a significant amount of earnings from fiscal and fiscal in excess of the targets for those periods which carries over as a reduction to the targets in future years  consideration that the fiscal earnings significantly exceeded both the fiscal and fiscal targets  our operating income projections for the lilly pulitzer operating group for future periods which exceed the fiscal operating results and the shorter remaining term of the contingent consideration arrangement  which provides greater visibility through the term of the agreement 
our assessment of these factors resulted in a reduction of the discount rate for the contingent consideration to a rate which reflects the reduced uncertainty of the amounts to be paid pursuant to the arrangement 
based on this assessment we determined that as of february   the fair value of the contingent consideration was million  which reflects the expected remaining payment of million discounted to fair value  after payment of million in fiscal an increase in the discount rate of basis points as of february  would decrease the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation included in our consolidated balance sheet and the change in fair value of contingent consideration charge to our statement of earnings for fiscal by million  while a change in projected earnings for fiscal and fiscal of would not impact the fair value of the contingent consideration as the earnings targets for those years would still be expected to be exceeded 
the fair value of the contingent consideration liability is expected to increase each period with the recognition of change in fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the passage of time at the applicable discount rate as we approach the payment dates of the contingent consideration absent any 
table of contents significant changes in assumptions related to the valuation or the probability of payment of the contingent consideration earned during the prior year 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recognized change in fair value of contingent consideration of million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the amounts recognized in fiscal reflect the passage of time as well the change in the discount rate at february  as discussed above  while fiscal primarily reflected the passage of time  with no significant changes in our assumptions used in determining fair value during fiscal we estimate that the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to the passage of time in fiscal and fiscal will be approximately million in each year  however the total change in fair value of contingent consideration expense recognized in future periods could be significantly different if we change certain of our assumptions related to the contingent consideration during those periods or if the expected earnings of lilly pulitzer are significantly lower than earnings levels achieved in fiscal we account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
the cost of each acquired business is allocated to the individual tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred as a result of the acquisition based on their estimated fair values 
the assessment of the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the use of the acquired assets  anticipated cash flows  probabilities of cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
to the extent information to revise the allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price will be adjusted 
should information become available after the allocation period indicating that adjustments to the allocation are appropriate  those adjustments will be included in operating results 
the allocation period will not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition 
for the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination  adjusting previously recorded assets and liabilities to fair value at each balance sheet date and assessing  and possibly adjusting  recognized assets for impairment  the assumptions that we make regarding the valuation of these assets could differ significantly from the assumptions made by other parties 
the use of different assumptions could result in materially different valuations for the respective assets and liabilities  which would impact our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb has issued certain changes to accounting pronouncements which may impact our financial statements in future periods upon adoption 
for details on these accounting pronouncements  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
seasonality each of our operating groups are impacted by seasonality as the demand by specific product or style  as well as by distribution channel  may vary significantly depending on the time of year 
for information regarding the seasonality impact on individual operating groups and for our total company  see part i  item  business  included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our indebtedness  which could impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
we intend to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow  primarily through a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  although at times we may not have any variable rate or fixed rate debt 
additionally  we may enter into interest rate swap arrangements related to certain of our variable rate borrowings in order to fix the interest rate on variable rate borrowings if we determine that our exposure to interest 
table of contents rate changes is higher than optimal 
our assessment also considers our need for flexibility in our borrowing arrangements resulting from the seasonality of our business  among other factors 
we continuously monitor interest rates to consider the sources and terms of our borrowing facilities in order to determine whether we have achieved our interest rate management objectives 
we do not enter into debt agreements or interest rate hedging transactions on a speculative basis 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we redeemed our senior secured notes which remained outstanding at that time 
this redemption was funded through borrowings under our us revolving credit agreement and cash on hand  resulting in all of our borrowings being variable rate borrowings subsequent to this redemption 
in order to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates in future periods  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement under which we fixed the interest rate on certain of our borrowings  ranging from million to million  during the period from august until march  which essentially results in a portion of our anticipated debt levels during those periods being fixed rate borrowings at a rate equal to plus the applicable margin  as specified in our us revolving credit agreement 
as of february   we had million of debt outstanding which was subject to variable interest rates 
our lines of credit  which include our us revolving credit agreement and our us revolving credit agreement  accrue interest based on variable interest rates while providing the necessary borrowing flexibility we require due to the seasonality of our business and our need to fund certain product purchases with trade letters of credit 
considering the changes in our borrowing arrangements in fiscal  we do not believe that borrowings and interest rates  and therefore interest expense  for fiscal are indicative of borrowings and interest expense in future periods 
based on our current borrowings under our revolving credit agreements and expected borrowings in fiscal  we anticipate that interest expense will be approximately million during fiscal assuming no significant changes in interest rates 
we estimate that a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent that the amounts outstanding under our variable rate lines of credit change our exposure to changes in interest rates would also change to the extent we have not entered into an interest rate swap for those amounts 
foreign currency risk to the extent that we have assets and liabilities  as well as operations  denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
we receive united states dollars for most of our product sales 
less than of our net sales in fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
these sales primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
a strengthening united states dollar could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of earnings in future periods  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts as previously reported 
based on our net sales during fiscal denominated in foreign currencies  if the united states dollar had been stronger against the british pound we would have experienced a decrease in consolidated net sales of million  but we believe the impact on operating income would not have been material 
substantially all of our inventory purchases  including goods for operations in the united kingdom  from contract manufacturers throughout the world are denominated in united states dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future even though our inventory is purchased on a united states dollar arrangement 
additionally  to the extent that the exchange rate between the united states 
table of contents dollar and the currency that the inventory will be sold in eg the british pound changes  the gross margins of those businesses could be impacted significantly 
we may from time to time purchase short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the amounts outstanding at any time during the year may vary 
as of february   we were a party to million of such contracts that were unsettled  which had an unrealized fair value resulting in a liability of million 
these contracts primarily consist of million of agreements to purchase us dollars with british pound sterling and million of agreements to sell euro for british pound sterling 
when such contracts are outstanding  the contracts are marked to market with the offset being recognized in other comprehensive income or our consolidated statement of earnings if the transaction does or does not  respectively  qualify as a hedge in accordance with gaap 
we anticipate that as we expand tommy bahama into international markets in the future  our exposure to foreign currency changes will increase 
we also anticipate that we will have exposure to foreign currency changes for currencies that we currently do not have any exposure to  including various currencies in asia 
initially  that exposure will be a result of the net investment in those currencies as we expand international operations 
the extent of our exposure will be dependent upon the timing of when and to what magnitude we expand into international markets 
therefore  we do not believe it is possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the potential impact of our future exposure to foreign currencies related to our tommy bahama international operations at this time 
we view our foreign investments as long term and  as a result  we generally do not hedge such foreign investments 
also  we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments related to foreign currency exposure for speculative purposes 
commodity and inflation risk we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through the purchase of raw materials and finished goods and increased operating costs to the extent that any such fluctuations are not reflected by adjustments in the selling prices of our products 
inflation deflation risks are managed by each operating group through selective price increases when possible  productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives 
we do not enter into significant long term sales or purchase contracts  and we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such commodity risk 
based on purchases and negotiations for inventory purchases thus far in fiscal  it appears that certain product costing pressures  including transportation and labor  will not decline much  if at all  and that such costs as well as other product costs likely could increase in the future  which could negatively impact our operating results in the future
