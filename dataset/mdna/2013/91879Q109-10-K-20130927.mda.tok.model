item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes related thereto included in this form k 
to the extent that the following management s discussion and analysis contains statements which are not of a historical nature  such statements are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a  risk factors in this form k 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements section and item a  risk factors each included in this form k 
management s discussion and analysis includes discussion of financial performance within each of our segments 
we have chosen to specifically include reported ebitda defined as segment net revenue less segment operating expense  plus or minus segment equity investment income or loss and for the real estate segment  plus gain on sale of real property and net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents  in the following discussion because we consider these measurements to be significant indications of our financial performance and available capital resources 
reported ebitda and net debt are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap 
we utilize reported ebitda in evaluating our performance and in allocating resources to our segments 
refer to the end of the results of operations section for a reconciliation of reported ebitda to net income attributable to vail resorts  inc we also believe that net debt is an important measurement as it is an indicator of our ability to obtain additional capital resources for our future cash needs 
refer to the end of the results of operations section for a reconciliation of net debt 
items excluded from reported ebitda and net debt are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance or liquidity 
reported ebitda and net debt should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to  or substitute for  net income  net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because reported ebitda and net debt are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and are thus susceptible to varying calculations  reported ebitda and net debt as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
overview our operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments mountain  lodging and real estate 
resort is the combination of the mountain and lodging segments 
revenue from the mountain  lodging and real estate segments represented  and  respectively  of our net revenue for fiscal mountain segment the mountain segment is comprised of the operations of eight ski resort properties at the vail  breckenridge  keystone and beaver creek mountain resorts in colorado colorado resorts  the heavenly  northstar and kirkwood mountain resorts in the lake tahoe area of california and nevada tahoe resorts  the canyons mountain resort in park city  utah acquired in may  and the ski areas of afton alps in minnesota and mount brighton in michigan both acquired in december urban ski areas  as well as ancillary services  primarily including ski school  dining and retail rental operations 
our mountain ski resorts were open for business for the ski season primarily from mid november through mid april  which is the peak operating season for the mountain segment 
our single largest source of mountain segment revenue is the sale of lift tickets including season passes  which represented approximately  and of mountain segment net revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
lift revenue is driven by volume and pricing 
pricing is impacted by both absolute pricing as well as the demographic mix of guests  which impacts the price points at which various products are purchased 
the demographic mix of guests is divided into two primary categories out of state and international destination guests and in state and local in state guests 
for the ski season  destination guests comprised approximately of our mountain resort skier visits  while in state guests comprised approximately of our mountain resort skier visits  which compares to approximately and  respectively  for the and ski seasons 
destination guests generally purchase our higher priced lift ticket products and utilize more ancillary services such as ski school  dining and retail rental  as well as lodging at or around our resorts 
destination guest visitation is less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather  but can be more impacted by adverse economic conditions or the global geopolitical climate 
in state guests tend to be more value oriented and weather sensitive 
we offer a variety of season pass products for all of our ski resorts ski areas  marketed towards both destination and in state guests 
our season pass product offerings range from providing access to a combination of our resorts to our epic season pass that allows pass holders unlimited and unrestricted access to all of our ski resorts and urban ski areas 
our season pass products provide a value option to our guests  which in turn assists us in developing a loyal base of customers who commit to ski at our resorts areas generally in advance of the ski season and typically ski more days each season at our resorts areas than those guests who do not buy season passes 
as such  our season pass program drives strong customer loyalty  mitigates exposure to many weather sensitive guests  and generates additional ancillary spending 
in addition  our season pass products attract new guests to our resorts areas 
all of our season pass products  including the epic season pass  are predominately sold prior to the start of the ski season 
season pass revenue  although primarily collected prior to the ski season  is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations ratably over the ski season 
for the  and ski seasons  approximately  and  respectively  of total lift revenue recognized was derived from season pass revenue 
the cost structure of our ski resort operations has a significant fixed component with variable expenses including  but not limited to  forest service fees  credit card fees  retail rental cost of sales and labor  ski school labor and dining operations  as such  profit margins can fluctuate greatly based on the level of revenues 
lodging segment operations within the lodging segment include i ownership management of a group of luxury hotels through the rockresorts brand  the majority of which are proximate to our ski resorts  ii ownership management of non rockresorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to our ski resorts  iii nps concessionaire properties including gtlc  iv cme  a colorado resort ground transportation company  and v mountain resort golf courses 
the performance of lodging properties including managed condominium rooms proximate to our ski resorts  and cme  is closely aligned with the performance of the mountain segment and generally experiences similar seasonal trends  particularly with respect to visitation by destination guests  and represented approximately  and of lodging segment net revenue excluding lodging segment revenue associated with reimbursement of payroll costs for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
management primarily focuses on lodging net revenue excluding payroll cost reimbursements and lodging operating expense excluding reimbursed payroll costs which are not measures of financial performance under gaap as the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin  as such the revenue and corresponding expense have no effect on our lodging reported ebitda which we use to evaluate lodging segment performance 
revenue of the lodging segment during our first and fourth fiscal quarters is generated primarily by the operations of our nps concessionaire properties as their operating season generally occurs from mid may to mid october  mountain resort golf operations and seasonally low operations from our other owned and managed properties and businesses 
real estate segment the real estate segment owns and develops real estate in and around our resort communities and primarily engages in vertical development of projects  as well as occasional sales of land to third party developers 
currently  the principal activities of our real estate segment include the marketing and selling of remaining condominium units that are available for sale  sale of strategic land parcels  planning for future real estate development projects  including zoning and acquisition of applicable permits and the purchase of selected strategic land parcels for future development 
revenue from vertical development projects is not recognized until closing of individual units within a project  which occurs after substantial completion of the project 
we attempt to mitigate the risk associated with vertical development by often utilizing guaranteed maximum price construction contracts although certain construction costs may not be covered by contractual limitations  pre selling a portion of the project  requiring significant non refundable deposits  and potentially obtaining non recourse financing for certain projects although our last two major vertical development projects have not incurred any such direct third party financing 
additionally  our real estate development projects most often result in the creation of certain resort assets that provide additional benefit to the mountain and lodging segments 
our revenue from the real estate segment  and associated expense  can fluctuate significantly based upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold  causing volatility in the real estate segment operating results from period to period 
recent trends  risks and uncertainties the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified in item a and elsewhere in this form k 
we have identified the following important factors as well as uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact our future financial performance the timing and amount of snowfall can have an impact on mountain and lodging revenue particularly in regards to skier visits and the duration and frequency of guest visitation 
to help mitigate this impact  we sell a variety of season pass products prior to the beginning of the ski season resulting in a more stabilized stream of lift revenue 
additionally  our season pass products provide a value option to our guests  which in turn creates a guest commitment predominantly prior to the start of the ski season 
in march  we began our pre season pass sales program for the ski season 
through september   our pre season pass sales for the upcoming ski season including the urban ski areas and canyons for both the current and prior year  which prior year includes pass sales that occurred before our acquisition of the urban ski areas and the canyons transaction have increased approximately in units and increased approximately in sales dollars  compared to the prior year period ended september  we cannot predict if this favorable trend will continue through the fall pass sales campaign  nor can we predict the overall impact that season pass sales will have on lift revenue for the ski season 
in fiscal  our lift revenue was favorably impacted by price increases at our mountain resorts that were implemented for the ski season 
prices for the ski season have not yet been finalized  and as such  there can be no assurances as to the level of price increases  if any  which will occur and the impact that pricing may have on visitation or revenue 
our fiscal results for our mountain and lodging segments showed significant improvement over fiscal largely due to the unprecedented low snowfall conditions throughout the ski season 
however  our fiscal results were tempered by poor snowfall and unseasonably warm temperatures that occurred during the early ski season in colorado and during the latter half of the ski season in tahoe 
we cannot predict whether snowfall levels will return to historical averages for the upcoming ski season nor can we estimate the impact there may be to advance bookings  guest travel  season pass sales  lift revenue excluding season passes  retail rental sales or other ancillary services revenue next ski season as a result of the past two ski seasons snowfall conditions  or if snowfall levels do not return to their historical average levels 
although many key economic indicators have improved recently including growth in the us stock markets  rising consumer confidence  and housing prices and lower unemployment  the us economy has struggled to gain momentum amid sweeping federal budget cuts  higher taxes  uncertainty over monetary policy and slow growth in many economies around the world 
given these economic trends and uncertainties  we cannot predict what the impact will be on overall travel and leisure or more specifically  on our guest visitation  guest spending or other related trends for the upcoming ski season 
on may   we entered into a long term lease with talisker pursuant to which we assumed resort operations of canyons which includes the ski area and related amenities 
the lease between us and talisker for canyons has an initial term of years with six year renewal options 
the lease provides for million in annual fixed payments  which increase each year by an inflation linked index of cpi less  with a floor of per annum 
in addition  the lease includes participating contingent payments to talisker of of the amount by which ebitda for the resort operations  as calculated under the lease  exceeds approximately million  with such threshold amount increased by an inflation linked index and a adjustment for any capital improvements or investments made under the lease by us 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded million in long term debt including capital lease obligations and other liabilities including an estimate for future participating contingent payments 
in addition to the lease  we entered into ancillary transaction documents setting forth our rights among others  to ongoing litigation between the current operator of park city mountain resort and talisker related to the validity of a lease of the talisker owned land under the ski terrain of park city mountain resort 
if the outcome of the litigation is favorable to talisker  the land under the ski terrain of park city mountain resort will become subject to our lease with talisker  which we expect would be beneficial to us as the inclusion of the ski terrain of park city mountain resort in the lease would require no additional consideration from us but any earnings derived from that ski terrain would accrue to our benefit 
any such financial contribution from the additional ski terrain would be included as part of the calculation of ebitda for the resort operations  and as a result  factor into the participating contingent payment component of the lease payment as described above 
if the outcome of the litigation is unfavorable  we will be entitled to receive from talisker the rent payments that talisker receives from the current resort operator until such time as the current resort operator lease has ended and the ski terrain under park city mountain resort is then included in the lease 
we cannot predict whether we will realize all of the synergies expected from our operation of canyons nor can we predict the resources required to integrate its operations and the ultimate impact canyons will have on our future results of operations 
furthermore  if the litigation associated with the land under the ski terrain of park city mountain resort results in an unfavorable outcome it could result in a material impairment charge attributable to goodwill  certain indefinite lived intangible assets and or other assets recorded in conjunction with this transaction  negatively impacting our results of operations and stockholders equity 
during fiscal  in addition to the canyons transaction as discussed above  we announced our calendar capital expenditure plan which is estimated between approximately million and million  including resort capital expenditures for the first phase of our new summer activities plans  and is the largest number of planned improvements in our history  we completed the acquisition of two ski areas  afton alps in minnesota and mount brighton in michigan  for net cash consideration of approximately million  and on march   our board of directors increased our regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock by approximately to per share or approximately million annually based on our shares outstanding as of july  
we cannot predict that any strategic initiatives undertaken will achieve the anticipated results 
as of july   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as well as million available under the revolver component of our credit agreement which represents the total commitment of million less certain letters of credit outstanding of million 
additionally  we believe that the terms of our notes and our credit agreement allow for sufficient flexibility in our ability to make future acquisitions  investments  distributions to stockholders and incur additional debt 
this  combined with our completed real estate projects where the proceeds from future real estate closings on the ritz carlton residences  vail  and one ski hill place in breckenridge are expected to significantly exceed future carrying costs  and the continued positive cash flow from operating activities primarily occurring during our second and third fiscal quarters less capital expenditures has and is anticipated to continue to provide us with significant liquidity which we believe will allow us to consider additional strategic investments and other forms of returning value to our stockholders including the continued payment of a quarterly cash dividend 
real estate reported ebitda is highly dependent on  among other things  the timing of closings on condominium units available for sale  which determines when revenue and associated cost of sales is recognized 
changes to the anticipated timing or mix of closing on one or more real estate projects  or unit closings within a real estate project  could materially impact real estate reported ebitda for a particular quarter or fiscal year 
as of july   we had units of which two units sold subsequent to july  at the ritz carlton residences  vail and units of which one unit sold subsequent to july  at one ski hill place in breckenridge available for sale 
we cannot predict the ultimate number of units that we will sell  the ultimate price we will receive  or when the units will sell  although we currently believe the selling process will take multiple years 
additionally  if a prolonged weakness in the real estate market or general economic conditions were to occur we may have to adjust our selling prices more than currently anticipated in an effort to sell and close on units available for sale 
however  our risk associated with adjusting selling prices to levels that may not be acceptable to us is partially mitigated by the fact that we do generate cash flow from placing unsold units into our rental program until such time selling prices are at acceptable levels to us 
furthermore  if weakness in the real estate market were to persist for multiple years  thus requiring us to sell remaining units below anticipated pricing levels including any sales concessions and discounts for the remaining inventory of units at the ritz carlton residences  vail or one ski hill place in breckenridge  it may result in an impairment charge on one or both projects see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
in accordance with gaap  we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as well as on an interim basis to the extent factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of our reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets below book value 
we also evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of our goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of our reporting units and terminal values of the businesses using projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams  and we evaluate long lived assets based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
our fiscal annual impairment test did not result in a goodwill or significant indefinite lived intangible asset impairment see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
however  if lower than projected levels of cash flows were to occur due to prolonged abnormal weather conditions or a prolonged weakness in general economic conditions  among other risks  it could cause less than expected growth and or a reduction in terminal values and cash flows and could result in an impairment charge attributable to certain goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and or long lived assets particularly related to our lodging operations  negatively impacting our results of operations and stockholders equity

our colorado resorts experienced strong results from the peak holiday periods of christmas through spring break and easter compared to the prior year  however  these results were tempered by poor snowfall and unseasonably warm temperatures which occurred from the start of the ski season through the pre christmas holiday period which adversely impacted skier visitation to our colorado resorts during this period 
as such  skier visitation to our colorado resorts increased overall for the ski season compared to the ski season 
our tahoe resorts experienced significantly better snowfall and weather conditions during first half of the ski season which contributed to a significant increase in skier visitation to the tahoe region combined with the addition of kirkwood  however  the early momentum at our tahoe resorts was slowed by dry conditions and warm temperatures experienced throughout the latter half of the ski season

fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  our resorts experienced historically low snowfall with cumulative snowfall down more than over the ski season and one of the mildest winters on record  including over the key christmas  spring break and easter periods 
these weather conditions adversely impacted our skier visitation which was down with our colorado and tahoe resorts down and  respectively for the ski season compared to the ski season 
despite these unprecedented adverse conditions  revenues were generally stabilized by increased season pass sales  higher pricing and increased average guest spend 
additionally  mountain reported ebitda for fiscal was unfavorably impacted as compared to fiscal due to the inclusion of first quarter operating results and transaction costs of northstar acquired in october in fiscal which generated million of negative ebitda due to no ski operations partially offset by fiscal acquisition costs of million  and due to the timing of the acquisition of kirkwood acquired in april which generated million of negative ebitda and acquisition related costs incurred on kirkwood and skiinfo acquired in february of million 
lift revenue remained relatively flat for fiscal  compared to fiscal  resulting from a million  or  increase in season pass revenue  offset by a million  or  decrease in lift revenue excluding season pass revenue 
the increase in season pass revenue was driven primarily by an increase in pricing for season pass products as well as a increase in unit sales 
the decline in lift revenue excluding season pass revenue was due to a decline in visitation excluding season pass holders of  compared to fiscal  partially offset by an increase in etp excluding season pass holders of  or

owned occupancy increased by percentage points and revpar increased 
the increase in occupancy and revpar is primarily due to an increase in transient business at the doubletree in breckenridge and transient and group business at our keystone resort properties 
revenue from managed condominium rooms increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  and was attributable to million of incremental revenue from managed condominium units at canyons  additional managed condominium units at kirkwood  and an increase in transient guest visitation at our managed condominium rooms in colorado and the tahoe region due to increased skier visitation during the ski season 
dining revenue for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in group business at keystone  increased dining revenue at the arrabelle and the doubletree in breckenridge due to an increase in transient and group visitation  increased dining revenue at gtlc  as well as incremental dining revenue from canyons and flagg ranch  partially offset by a decline in vail lodging banquet revenue 
transportation revenue increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in total passengers of  partially offset by a decline in revenue per passenger driven by competitive pricing strategies 
other revenue for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in conference services provided to our group business  an increase in retail and ancillary revenue from gtlc and flagg ranch  and an increase in strategic alliance marketing revenue  partially offset by lower revenue from managed hotel properties as a result of the previously announced rockresorts reorganization plan 
operating expense excluding reimbursed payroll costs increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal labor and labor related benefits increased million  or  resulting from normal wage adjustments  an increase in contract labor associated with increased occupancy  increased conference services provided to our group business  and incremental labor costs associated with canyons and flagg ranch of million  partially offset by a reduction in overhead labor associated with the rockresorts reorganization plan 
other expense increased million  or  primarily due to incremental expenses associated with canyons and flagg ranch of million  higher variable operating costs including higher food and beverage cost of sales  partially offset by a decrease in reimbursable costs other than payroll from managed hotel properties due to the rockresorts reorganization plan 
general and administrative expense decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  as a result of the rockresorts reorganization plan  partially offset by higher allocated corporate costs 
revenue from payroll cost reimbursements and the corresponding reimbursed payroll costs relates to payroll costs at managed hotel properties where we are the employer and all payroll costs are reimbursed by the owners of the properties under contractual arrangements 
since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin  the revenue and corresponding expense have no effect on our lodging reported ebitda 
the decrease in revenue from payroll cost reimbursements and the corresponding decrease in reimbursed payroll costs for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a reduction in the number of managed hotel properties as previously announced under the rockresorts reorganization plan 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue from owned hotel rooms increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  which was primarily driven by a million increase in room revenue from gtlc and flagg ranch 
gtlc room revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and was driven by increases in both adr and occupancy as gains in occupancy were largely driven by improved weather conditions in may and june compared to the same period in fiscal our colorado lodging resort properties room revenue was adversely impacted by a decline in occupancy in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in transient guest visitation which was adversely impacted by a decrease in skier visitation at our colorado ski resorts as discussed in the mountain segment 
also negatively impacting revenue from owned hotel rooms for fiscal compared to fiscal was a decline in group business at our keystone resort  as well as the closure of breckenridge mountain lodge 
revenue from managed condominium rooms increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  and was primarily attributable to additional managed condominium units at one ski hill place in breckenridge and the ritz carlton residences  vail  partially offset by the decline in group business at our keystone resort 
dining revenue for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased dining revenue at the arrabelle  and increased dining revenue at gtlc due to higher park visitation and the addition of flagg ranch in fiscal  mostly offset by a decrease in group visitation at our keystone resort and the conversion of an owned restaurant at the lodge at vail to a leased facility 
transportation revenue decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the decline in destination skier visitation discussed in the mountain segment as well as price decreases instituted during the ski season to compete with rental car discounts and other competitors which resulted in a decline in revenue per passenger combined with a decrease in passengers of 
golf revenue increased million or  for fiscal compared to prior year  primarily due to the addition of a golf course at northstar as part of that resort acquisition in october and an increase in the number of paid golf rounds played at our other golf courses 
other revenue decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in conference services provided to our group business at our keystone resort  lower management revenue from managed hotel properties  and lower commissions earned from reservations booked through our central reservation system  partially offset by an increase in ancillary and retail revenue at gtlc and flagg ranch 
operating expense excluding reimbursed payroll costs increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal operating expense for fiscal benefited from the receipt of million  net of legal expenses included as a credit in other expense  for the settlement of alleged damages related to the cme acquisition 
excluding the impact of the cme settlement  operating expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal labor and labor related benefits increased million  or  resulting from normal wage and benefit increases  increased labor costs associated with operating flagg ranch  and incremental labor associated with the addition of managed condominiums in the lake tahoe region  partially offset by lower staffing levels associated with decreased occupancy primarily at our colorado lodging properties and decreased conference services provided to our group business 
general and administrative expense for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal due to a decrease in the lodging segment component of corporate costs  lower central reservations costs  and lower employee medical costs  partially offset by reorganization related expenses and estimated uncollectible account receivables from managed hotel properties in conjunction with the previously announced rockresorts reorganization plan 
other expense  excluding the cme settlement  increased million  or  primarily due to the addition of flagg ranch and managed condominiums in the lake tahoe region  partially offset by a decrease in reimbursable costs other than payroll associated with managed hotel properties 
revenue from payroll cost reimbursements and the corresponding reimbursed payroll costs relates to payroll costs at managed hotel properties where we are the employer and all payroll costs are reimbursed by the owners of the properties under contractual arrangements 
since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin  the revenue and corresponding expense have no effect on our lodging reported ebitda 
the decrease in revenue from payroll cost reimbursements and the corresponding reimbursed payroll costs in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a reduction in the number of managed hotel properties where we are the employer as announced under the rockresorts reorganization plan 
real estate segment real estate segment operating results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal are presented by category as follows in thousands percentage year ended july  increase decrease total real estate net revenue real estate operating expense cost of sales including sales commissions other total real estate operating expense gain on sale of real property nm real estate reported ebitda real estate reported ebitda includes million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our real estate operating revenue is primarily determined by the timing of closings and the mix of real estate sold in any given period 
different types of projects have different revenue and profit margins  therefore  as the real estate inventory mix changes it can greatly impact real estate segment net revenue  operating expense and real estate reported ebitda 
fiscal real estate segment net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closing of ten condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  and twelve condominium units at one ski hill place million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
the average price per square foot for both these projects is driven by their premier locations and the comprehensive and exclusive amenities related to these projects 
in addition to the revenue generated by the closing of units as noted above  real estate net revenue also included million of rental revenue from placing certain of our unsold units into our rental program 
additionally  during fiscal we recorded a gain on sale of real property of million net of million in related cost of sales for a land parcel at the base of breckenridge peak which sold for million 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million resulting from the closing of ten condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail average cost per square foot of and from the closing of twelve condominium units at one ski hill place average cost per square foot of 
the cost per square foot for both these projects is reflective of the high end features and amenities and high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
additionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which includes marketing expense for the real estate available for sale including those units that have not yet closed  carrying costs for units available for sale and overhead costs  such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs which were favorably impacted by a shift in allocated corporate costs to the mountain and lodging segments 
in addition  included in other segment operating expense is a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to a legal dispute on a previously completed project 
fiscal real estate segment net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closing of condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  and seven condominium units at one ski hill place million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
in addition to the revenue generated by the closing of units as noted above  real estate net revenue also included million of rental revenue from placing certain of our unsold units into our rental program 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million resulting from the closing of condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail average cost per square foot of and from the closing of seven condominium units at one ski hill place average cost per square foot of 
additionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which includes marketing expense for the real estate available for sale including those units that have not yet closed  carrying costs for units available for sale and overhead costs  such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
in addition  included in other segment operating expense is a million charge recorded due to a dispute with contractors and an insurance carrier over the recovery of costs incurred by us in the fourth quarter of fiscal for remediation work at the arrabelle project 
this charge was partially offset by the receipt in the fourth quarter of fiscal of a million settlement for alleged damages caused by the architect on the arrabelle project included as a credit to other expense in fiscal 
fiscal real estate segment net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closing of condominium units units sold to the ritz carlton development company and units sold to individuals at the ritz carlton residences  vail million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
additionally  during fiscal  we recognized million of revenue related to deposits from buyers who defaulted on units under contract at the ritz carlton residences  vail and we closed on four condominium units at one ski hill place million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million resulting from the closing of condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail average cost per square foot of  and from the closing of four condominium units at one ski hill place average cost per square foot of 
additionally  sales commissions of approximately million were incurred commensurate with revenue recognized 
other operating expense of million including million of stock based compensation expense was primarily comprised of general and administrative costs which include marketing expense for the real estate available for sale including those units that have not yet closed  carrying costs for units available for sale and overhead costs  such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
other items in addition to segment operating results  the following material items contribute to our overall financial position 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for both fiscal and fiscal increased over the applicable prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in the fixed asset base due to incremental capital expenditures  assets assumed in the acquisitions and for fiscal  the increase included depreciation on unsold one ski hill place and ritz carlton residences  vail units that are included in our rental program 
asset impairment charge 
we previously extended a million note receivable  including accrued interest  to an entity that owned a hotel that we managed 
this entity was in default on certain debt owed by it and the third party owners of the entity were unable to reach an agreement to restructure the debt with their creditor 
as a result  the creditor foreclosed on the hotel in june as such  we recorded an asset impairment charge relating to the note receivable of million in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal loss on extinguishment of debt 
in april  we issued million of notes  the proceeds of which  along with available cash resources  were used to retire the outstanding million principal amount of notes and paid related call premiums  issuance costs  transaction and legal fees 
total costs to retire the notes and issuance costs for the notes were million  of which million were recorded as deferred financing costs and million was recorded as a loss on extinguishment in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal additionally  included in the loss on extinguishment is a write off of a portion of unamortized debt issuance costs and legal fees associated with the previously issued notes 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased for fiscal compared to fiscal due to million of interest expense on the canyons obligation recorded in conjunction with the canyons transaction entered into on may  interest expense was relatively flat for fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower interest expense from the issuance of the notes and the extinguishment of the notes in fiscal  mostly offset by capitalized interest recorded on the ritz carlton residences  vail development project in fiscal income taxes 
our effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our tax provision and effective tax rate are driven primarily by the amount of pre tax income  which is adjusted for items that are deductible non deductible for tax purposes only ie permanent items and taxable income generated by state jurisdictions that varies from the consolidated pre tax income 
additionally  the income tax provision recorded for fiscal   and  reflects million  million  and million  respectively  of income tax benefits due to a reversal of income tax contingencies resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations 
in  we amended previously filed tax returns for the tax years from through in an effort to remove restrictions under section of the internal revenue code on approximately million of nols relating to fresh start accounting from our reorganization in as a result  we requested a refund related to the amended returns in the amount of million and have reduced our federal tax liability in the amount of million in subsequent tax returns 
in  the irs completed its examination of our filing position in our amended returns and disallowed our request for refund and our position to remove the restriction on the nols 
we appealed the examiner disallowance of the nols to the office of appeals 
in december  the office of appeals denied our appeal  as well as a request for mediation 
we disagreed with the irs interpretation disallowing the utilization of the nols and in august  filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of colorado seeking recovery of million in over payments that were previously denied by the irs  plus interest 
on july   the district court granted us summary judgment  concluding that the irs decision disallowing the utilization of the nols was inappropriate 
the irs is entitled to appeal the decision of the district court to grant the motion for summary judgment and we do not know whether the irs will do so or  if it does appeal  whether the appeal would be successful 
however  at this point  the district court proceedings have been stayed pending on going settlement discussions between the parties 
we are also a party to two related tax proceedings in the united states tax court regarding calculation of nol carryover deductions for tax years  and the two proceedings involve substantially the same issues as the litigation in the district court wherein we disagree with the irs as to the utilization of nols 
at this time  however  it is uncertain whether or how the potential resolution of the district court case may affect these tax court proceedings 
the trial date for tax court proceedings has been continued pending on going settlement discussions between the parties 
since the legal proceeding surrounding the utilization of the nols has not been fully resolved  including a determination of the amount of refund and the possibility that the district court s ruling may be appealed by the irs  there remains considerable uncertainty of what portion  if any  of the nols will be realized  and as such  we have not reflected any of the benefits of the utilization of the nols within our financial statements 
however  the range of potential reversal of other long term liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that would be recorded as a benefit to our income tax provision is between zero and million 
reconciliation of non gaap measures the following table reconciles from segment reported ebitda to net income attributable to vail resorts  inc in thousands year ended july  mountain reported ebitda lodging reported ebitda resort reported ebitda real estate reported ebitda total reported ebitda depreciation and amortization loss on disposal of fixed assets  net investment income  net interest expense  net asset impairment charge loss on extinguishment of debt income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to vail resorts  inc the following table reconciles net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents in thousands july  long term debt long term debt due within one year total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt liquidity and capital resources significant sources of cash historically  we have lower cash available as of our fiscal year end as well as at the end of our first fiscal quarter of each year as compared to our second and third fiscal quarter ends primarily due to the seasonality of our mountain segment operations 
additionally  cash provided by operating activities can be impacted by the timing or mix of closings on and investment in real estate development projects 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents as of july   compared to million as of july  we generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million and million generated during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we currently anticipate that resort reported ebitda will continue to provide a significant source of future operating cash flows combined with proceeds from the sale of remaining inventory of real estate available for sale from the completed ritz carlton residences  vail and one ski hill place at breckenridge projects 
in addition to our million of cash and cash equivalents at july   we have available million under our credit agreement which represents the total commitment of million less certain letters of credit outstanding of million 
we believe the credit agreement  which matures in  provides adequate flexibility and is priced favorably with any new borrowings currently being priced at libor plus 
fiscal compared to fiscal we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal  an increase of million when compared to the million of cash generated in fiscal the increase in operating cash flows was primarily a result of an increase in resort reported ebitda in fiscal compared to fiscal cash flow from operations was also favorably impacted by a reduction in inventory and an increase in accrued expenses of million  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses  other assets and income tax payments of million 
additionally  we generated million in proceeds from real estate development project closings net of sales commissions and deposits previously received in fiscal compared to million in proceeds net of sales commissions and deposits previously received from real estate development project closings that occurred in fiscal cash used in investing activities decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million decrease in resort capital expenditures during fiscal compared to fiscal  a decrease in cash used for the acquisitions of businesses of million  and the cash receipt of million related to the sale of real estate development land at the base of breckenridge peak in fiscal  partially offset by payments for commitments in conjunction with the canyons transaction of million in fiscal cash used in financing activities decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the repurchase of common stock of million in fiscal and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits recognized on the vesting and exercise of stock awards of million during fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by an increase in the amount of cash dividends paid on our common stock of million in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal  a decrease of million when compared to the million of cash generated in fiscal the decrease in operating cash flows was primarily a result of a reduction in proceeds from real estate closings that occurred in fiscal  which generated million in net proceeds net of sales commissions and deposits previously received compared to million generated in net proceeds net of sales commissions and deposits previously received in fiscal  which included the sale of units at the ritz carlton residences  vail to the ritz carlton development company pursuant to a contractual agreement when that project received its certificate of occupancy 
partially offsetting the decline in proceeds from real estate sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was a decrease in investments in real estate of million and a reduction in real estate payables of million in fiscal due to the completion of construction at our real estate projects 
additionally  cash from operating activities was impacted by the lower resort reported ebitda for fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in the amount of prepaid expenses and other assets  net of an increase in inventory purchases 
cash used in investing activities decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the acquisition of northstar in fiscal for million net of cash assumed  mostly offset by an increase in resort capital expenditures of million in fiscal compared to fiscal  and the acquisition of kirkwood and skiinfo for a combined million net of cash assumed in fiscal cash used in financing activities decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the repayment of million outstanding under the credit agreement in fiscal and the payment of financing costs associated with the issuance of the notes and extinguishment of the notes and the amended and restated credit agreement of million in fiscal  almost entirely offset by the repurchase of common stock of million and an increase in the amount of cash dividends paid on our common stock of million in fiscal compared to fiscal significant uses of cash our cash uses currently include providing for operating expenditures and capital expenditures for assets to be used in resort operations and to a substantially lesser degree future real estate development projects 
we have historically invested significant cash in capital expenditures for our resort operations  and we expect to continue to make significant investments in the future subject to operating performance particularly as it relates to discretionary projects 
current planned capital expenditures primarily include investments that will allow us to maintain our high quality standards  as well as certain incremental discretionary improvements at our ski resorts areas and throughout our owned hotels 
we evaluate additional discretionary capital improvements based on an expected level of return on investment 
we currently anticipate we will spend approximately million to million of resort capital expenditures for calendar year included in these estimated capital expenditures are approximately million to million  which are necessary to maintain appearance and level of service appropriate to our resort operations  including routine replacement of snow grooming equipment and rental fleet equipment 
approximately million was spent for capital expenditures in calendar year as of july   leaving approximately million to million to spend in the remainder of calendar year planned discretionary expenditures for calendar year include terrain expansion on peak at breckenridge that includes the installation of two new chairlifts  a new on mountain restaurant at beaver creek that more than doubles the existing restaurant seating capacity  a new six person chairlift at vail  investment in energy efficient snowmaking equipment and technology  the final phase of renovations at the doubletree by hilton in breckenridge  an owned lodging property  among other projects 
also included in our calendar year plan are resort capital expenditures for the first phase of our new summer activities plans  epic discovery  at six of our resorts  and improvements at our urban ski areas 
we currently plan to utilize cash on hand  borrowings available under our credit agreement and or cash flow generated from future operations to provide the cash necessary to execute our capital plans 
in may  we entered into a lease and ancillary transaction documents with talikser pursuant to which we assumed resort operations of canyons which includes the ski area and related amenities 
the lease between us and talisker for canyons has an initial term of years with six year renewal options 
the lease provides for million in annual fixed payments  which increase each year by an inflation linked index of cpi less  with a floor of per annum 
in addition  the lease includes participating contingent payments to talisker of of the amount by which ebitda for the resort operations  as calculated under the lease  exceeds approximately million  with such threshold amount increased by an inflation linked index and a adjustment for any capital improvements or investments made under the lease by us 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded an initial long term debt obligation including capital lease obligations of million 
principal payments on the vast majority of our long term debt million of the total million debt outstanding as of july  are not due until fiscal and beyond 
as of july  and  total long term debt including long term debt due within one year was million and million  respectively 
net debt defined as long term debt plus long term debt due within one year less cash and cash equivalents increased from million as of july  to million as of july  primarily due to the financing of the canyons transaction  partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents 
our debt service requirements can be impacted by changing interest rates as we had million of variable rate debt associated with our employee housing development outstanding as of july  a basis point change in libor would cause our annual interest payments to change by approximately million 
additionally  as stated above the annual payments associated with the financing of the canyons transaction increase by the greater of cpi less  or 
the fluctuation in our debt service requirements  in addition to interest rate and inflation changes  may be impacted by future borrowings under our credit agreement or other alternative financing arrangements we may enter into 
our long term liquidity needs are dependent upon operating results that impact the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement  which can be mitigated by adjustments to capital expenditures  flexibility of investment activities and the ability to obtain favorable future financing 
we can respond to liquidity impacts of changes in the business and economic environment by managing our capital expenditures and the timing of new real estate development activity 
our share repurchase program is conducted under authorizations made from time to time by our board of directors 
the board of directors initially authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock march  and later authorized additional repurchases of up to  additional shares july  
during the year ended july   we did not repurchase any shares of common stock 
since inception of this stock repurchase program through july   we have repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
as of july    shares remained available to repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization 
shares of common stock purchased pursuant to the repurchase program will be held as treasury shares and may be used for the issuance of shares under the company s employee share award plan 
repurchases under these authorizations may be made from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by applicable laws  and subject to market conditions and other factors 
the timing as well as the number of shares that may be repurchased under the program will depend on a number of factors  including our future financial performance  our available cash resources and competing uses for cash that may arise in the future  the restrictions in our credit agreement and the indenture  prevailing prices of our common stock and the number of shares that become available for sale at prices that we believe are attractive 
these authorizations have no expiration date 
on june   our board of directors approved the commencement of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock at an annual rate of per share  subject to quarterly declaration 
on march  our board of directors approved a increase to our annual cash dividend to an annual rate of per share  subject to quarterly declaration 
additionally  on march   our board of directors approved an increase of approximately to our annual cash dividend on our common stock to an annual rate of per share or million annually based upon shares outstanding as of july   subject to quarterly declaration 
for the year ended july   we paid cash dividends of per share million in the aggregate 
our dividends were funded through available cash on hand 
subject to the discretion of our board of directors  applicable law and contractual restrictions  we anticipate paying regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the amount  if any  of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our available cash on hand  anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  restrictions contained in our credit agreement and the indenture  future prospects for earnings and cash flows  as well as other factors considered relevant by our board of directors 
covenants and limitations we must abide by certain restrictive financial covenants under our credit agreement and the indenture 
the most restrictive of those covenants include the following credit agreement covenants net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio and the interest coverage ratio each as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  our financing arrangements  including the indenture  limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness  make certain restricted payments  enter into certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit our ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets 
our borrowing availability under the credit agreement is primarily determined by the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  which is based on our segment operating performance  as defined in the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in our debt instruments as of july  which includes the impact from the canyons obligation and canyons annualized operating results 
we expect that we will continue to meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in our credit agreement  including the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio throughout the year ending july  however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet such financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  we would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks who are parties to the credit agreement 
there can be no assurance that such waiver or amendment would be granted  which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
contractual obligations as part of our ongoing operations  we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements  lease agreements and construction agreements in conjunction with our resort capital expenditures 
debt obligations  which total million as of july   are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
obligations under construction contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet until services and or goods are received which is in accordance with gaap 
additionally  operating lease and service contract obligations  which total million as of july   are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  which is in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of july  is as follows in thousands payments due by period fiscal more than contractual obligations total years years years long term debt outstanding principal fixed rate interest canyons obligation operating leases and service contracts purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the fixed rate interest payments  as well as long term debt payments  included in the table above assume that all debt outstanding as of july  will be held to maturity 
interest payments associated with variable rate debt have not been included in the table 
assuming that our million of variable rate long term debt as of july  is held to maturity  and utilizing interest rates in effect at july   our annual interest payments including commitment fees and letter of credit fees on variable rate long term debt as of july  is anticipated to be approximately million for each of fiscal  fiscal and for at least each of the next three years subsequent to fiscal the future annual interest obligations noted herein are estimated only in relation to debt outstanding as of july   and do not reflect interest obligations on potential future debt 
reflects interest expense payments associated with the remaining initial year lease term of the canyons obligation assuming a per annum floor increase in payments 
any potential increases to the annual fixed payment above the floor due to inflation linked index of cpi less have been excluded 
the payments under noncancelable operating leases included in the table above reflect the applicable minimum lease payments and exclude any potential contingent rent payments 
purchase obligations primarily include amounts which are classified as trade payables  accrued payroll and benefits  accrued fees and assessments  contingent consideration liability  accrued taxes including taxes for uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  and other commitments for goods and services not yet received  including construction contracts not included on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  in accordance with gaap 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet transactions that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  revenue  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying our accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the most critical accounting policies which were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we also have other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee of the board of directors 
real estate held for sale and investment description we evaluate each real estate project on at least a quarterly basis to determine if indicators of potential impairment exist 
impairment indicators are assessed separately for each real estate project and include  but are not limited to current economic conditions  the local real estate market and the number and type of real estate units we have available for sale  expected selling prices  net margins on units closed in recent months and projected margins on remaining units that are available for sale 
a real estate project is considered impaired when its carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future net cash flows the project is expected to generate 
judgments and uncertainties we determine the estimated cash flows by project starting with the current listing price of all units remaining to be sold by project which is then reduced by an estimate for sales discounts and concessions anticipated to be given to buyers over the remaining estimated sales period that takes into consideration the current economic environment  local real estate market and the type of real estate we have held for sale  marketing fees paid in conjunction with units to be sold  as applicable  estimated sales commissions and other closing costs including title  transfer and escrow fees  and estimated carrying costs net of rental income until units are sold  the sum of which is compared to the carrying value for each individual real estate project 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions based upon the analysis performed throughout fiscal  the estimated future cash flows of our real estate projects were in excess of their respective carrying values and as such no impairment charge has been recognized 
cash flows require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors such as the ultimate selling price of individual units within a project and the estimated absorption period in which units are expected to be sold 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
for example  as of july   if our anticipated net cash proceeds after sales concessions  discounts  selling and closing costs on the remaining inventory of condominium units at the ritz carlton residences  vail and one ski hill place in breckenridge were to decline by approximately and  respectively  compared to our current estimates we may be required to record an impairment charge on one or both of these projects 
goodwill and intangible assets description the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset below its carrying value 
other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment only when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
judgments and uncertainties application of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimated fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is primarily determined using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams 
these analyses require significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  available industry market data to the extent available  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business including expectations and assumptions regarding the impact of general economic conditions on our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur including terminal multiples  determination of the respective weighted average cost of capital and market participant assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and allocate goodwill to our reporting units based on the reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition generating the goodwill 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually as of may st 
based upon our annual impairment test performed during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values  and as such no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed and the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 
however  we determined that our colorado lodging reporting unit million of goodwill as of july  within our lodging segment was at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test  with the fair value of the reporting unit estimated at approximately in excess of its carrying value and therefore is at risk for a future impairment in the event of significant unfavorable changes in the forecasted cash flows  terminal value multiples and or weighted average cost of capital utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis 
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our colorado lodging reporting unit may include such items as prolonged adverse weather conditions  a prolonged weakness in the general economic conditions in which the colorado lodging reporting unit operates and therefore negatively impacting group and transient room nights and adr  and volatility in the equity and debt markets which could result in a higher discount rate 
while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units in excess of carrying values  if our assumptions are not realized  it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future 
however  it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material 
tax contingencies description we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
a significant amount of time may pass before a particular matter  for which we may have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the potential exposure associated with our various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable and we have adequate reserves for our tax contingencies million as of july   actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in those reserves and tax provisions that could be material 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require the use of cash and could possibly result in increased tax expense and effective tax rate and or adjustments to our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could possibly result in a reduction in our tax expense  effective tax rate  income taxes payable  other long term liabilities and or adjustments to our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in the year of settlement or in future years 
depreciable lives of assets description mountain and lodging operational assets  furniture and fixtures  computer equipment  software  vehicles and leasehold improvements are primarily depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets may become obsolete or require replacement before the end of their useful life in which the remaining book value would be written off or we could incur costs to remove or dispose of assets no longer in use 
judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our useful lives of the assets contain uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the useful life of the asset 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increased expense related to depreciable assets disposed of  removed or taken out of service prior to its originally estimated useful life  which may be material 
a decrease in the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets would have increased depreciation expense by approximately million for fiscal business combinations description a component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations 
we account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance for business combinations and related literature 
accordingly  we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired or the excess of the aggregate fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  we use various recognized valuation methods including present value modeling and referenced market values where available 
valuations are performed by management or independent valuation specialists under management s supervision  where appropriate 
judgments and uncertainties accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets  contractual obligations assumed and contingent consideration  where applicable 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to determination of weighted average cost of capital  market participant assumptions  royalty rates  terminal multiples  and estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions that a marketplace participant would use 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  or transaction date  as well as contingent consideration  where applicable  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
new accounting standards refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 
inflation although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on our operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  we generally have been able to pass the increase on to our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on our future profitability 
in may  we entered into a long term lease pursuant to which we assumed the operations of canyons which includes the ski area and related amenities 
the lease has an initial term of years with six year renewal options 
the lease provides for million in annual fixed payments  which increase each year by an inflation linked index of cpi less  with a floor of per annum 
as lease payments increase annually  there can be no assurance that these increases will be off set by increased cash flow generated from operations at canyons 
seasonality and quarterly results our mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenue and profits for our mountain and most of our lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  peak operating seasons for our nps concessionaire properties and our golf courses occur during the summer months while the winter season results in operating losses 
revenue and profits generated by nps concessionaire properties summer operations and golf operations are not nearly sufficient to fully offset our off season losses from our mountain and other lodging operations 
during fiscal  of total combined mountain and lodging segment net revenue excluding lodging segment revenue associated with reimbursement of payroll costs was earned during the second and third fiscal quarters 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full year see note  selected quarterly financial data unaudited  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   we had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing approximately of our total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during fiscal of 
based on variable rate borrowings outstanding as of july   a basis point or change in libor would result in our annual interest payments changing by million 
our market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates
