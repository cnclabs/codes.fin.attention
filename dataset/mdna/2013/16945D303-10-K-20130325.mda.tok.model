overview we were formed on june  to serve as a vehicle to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with a company having its primary operations in the prc 
on november   we consummated the acquisition of keenway limited  hong kong yi tat  and the then shareholders of keenway limited  including chen minhua  fan yanling  zhang xinchen  extra profit international limited  and lucky glory international limited  received newly issued shares of our common stock 
we currently operate the great golden lake tourist destination global geo park  world nature heritage  hua an tulou cluster or the earth buildings tourist destination world culture heritage  and yunding recreational park large scale national recreational park  covering over square kilometers in total 
our media business provides operating management service  including channeanl and advertisement management for the fetv since and the journey through china on the train on board railway program railway media

we expect that our tourism business will be the primary source of our revenue over the next few years 
advertising business has been our primary source of revenue for the last two years because the tourism business has experienced serious flooding and weather and the advertisement restriction was not executed by the local government 
the revenue from advertising will decrease because of the new restriction on the advertisement and we expect that the revenue from tourism will increase 
however  any increase in revenue will depend on the recovery of great golden lake and the progress we make in our other tourist destinations 
this expectation is also based on our new projects and construction of tourism destinations 
we have completed the nd phase of yunding park by the end of our advertising and tourism businesses are not seasonal 
we have visitors to our parks throughout the year 
in  at great golden lake and at hua an tulou  we do not anticipate much new construction as we are maintaining our existing operations and restoring what is already built and in operation 
we do not expect any construction or restoration to affect our operations 
we are subject to risks common to companies operating in china  including risks inherent in our distribution and commercialization efforts  uncertainty of foreign regulatory approvals and laws  the need for future capital and retention of key employees 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
factors affecting our performance advertising business for the advertising business  our advertising revenue is driven by the popularity of our television programs and the number of viewers tuning into our television station 
if more people tune into our station  we will be able to attract more advertisers and charge more for each advertising spot 
this will increase our revenues 
we strive to keep our audience rating high in order to be able to sell all our advertising air time 
we generate our advertising revenue by selling air time to sponsors and companies that are interested in marketing their products to our television viewers 
we incur administrative fees  business traveling fees  salaries  depreciation  automobile  and interest costs in operating the advertising business 
the new prc regulations set forth by the state administration for radio  film and television which bans certain television and radio advertisements has had a negative effect on our revenues and certain clients have not continued to advertise 
accordingly  we expect our revenues to decline 
tourism business for the tourism business  our revenue is driven by the reputation of our tourist destinations 
we strive to offer quality tourist attractions that offer our visitors diverse entertainment  including catering  hotel  transportation  and shopping 
we generate our revenue from our visitors and tourists who are looking to enjoy our tourist location 
we incur many costs associated with operating the tourist business  including  administration fees  business traveling fees  land use rights fees  and revenue sharing fees 
we entered into tourism management revenue sharing agreement with the taining government with respect to the great golden lake resort 
we have contracted to share the revenue over the course of the agreement as follows i from to we received of the revenue and the taining government received of the revenue  ii from to we received of the revenue and the taining government received of the revenue  iii from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue  iv from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue  v from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue  and vi from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue 
because of the decreasing revenue share that we will receive from the great golden lake resort and the resort has not been fully recovered to its previous level due to the flood  we may not be able to maintain our revenues from great golden lake 
however  with the recovery of great golden lake and the expected grand openings of three new tourism projects in the future  we believe that we will be able to generate more revenues in order to maintain the high gross profit margins in the tourism segment 
we expect our tourism business to be our primary source of revenue over the next few years 
although ming dynasty  yang sheng paradise  and city of caves are not yet operating  we expect them to be opened by the rd quarter of and to start generating revenue by the th quarter of also  we expect yunding to continue to grow and for the great golden lake to recover completely from the flooding 
results of operations results of operations for the years ended december  and the company is organized into two main business segments  tourism and advertisement 
the following table presents a summary of operating information for the years ended december  and increase for the years ended december  increase decrease decrease percentage all amounts  other than percentage  in us dollar us dollar net revenue advertisement tourism total net revenue cost of revenue advertisement tourism total cost of revenue gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses income from operations other expense  net interest income interest expense less provision for income tax net income loss net loss attributable to non controlling interest net income loss attributable to china yida holding co 
net revenue net revenue decreased by approximately million or approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in advertisement revenue which was partially offset by an increase in tourism 
advertisement advertisement revenue decreased by approximately million or approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the instability of the railway media broadcast revenue 
instability means that the program is broadcasting manually by the train attendant  we cannot monitor how he she broadcasts the tape  or whether he she has inserted the program tape or not 
railway program is a minute infomercial program  the content of the programs are tourism news and information 
advertising clients choose the length of the advertisement during the program  and the period of time they want the advertisement to be broadcasted 
recently some clients decide to purchase less advertisement from the company  and they may consider give up the railway promotion and terminate the cooperation with the company due to the instability of the railway program 
the operators determine in their sole discretion to broadcast the railway program or not 
we cannot monitor the operator s daily work 
the advertisers were concerned about our lack of control over the frequency of program broadcasting and therefore purchased fewer advertising spots from us which resulted in the decrease of revenue from railway media broadcast 
we generate revenue from the journey through china on the train program which is the only railway media broadcast we produced so far 
in february  our wholly owned subsidiary  fuzhou fuyu advertising co  ltd  entered into a six year exclusive agreement with china s railway media center to create an infomercial program named journey through china on the train  pursuant to which we produce minute monthly episodes focused on tourist destinations around china and travel ideas and tips with product placement advertisements 
the infomercial program is broadcasted on all high speed motor trains in china with tv panels made available by the ministry of railways of prc and cable tv channels 
we agree to pay an annual fee of approximately  or rmb  to railway media center for the first three years and approximately  or rmb  for the second three years 
we generate revenue from selling product placement advertisements 
however  since the program is broadcasted manually by train attendants  we have no control over the frequency of program broadcasting  which results in the substantial instability of our railway media revenue 
we generated approximately million from the journey through china on the train program for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  during this period  advertisement revenue from fetv also has experienced a decrease of from million to million due to actions by domestic media authorities restricting the broadcasting manner and content of tv advertising 
the new restricting content of tv advertising included shopping programs  mini ads and certain medical advertisements 
on august   fuyu  our wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a fujian education television channel project management agreement the agreement  with fujian education media limited company  a wholly state owned company organized by the fujian education tv station under the laws of the people s republic of china fuijan education media  pursuant to which  fujian education media granted to us five years of exclusive management rights for the fetv channel from august  to july  under the management contract  we obtained the full rights to provide programming and content management services and to re sell all advertising airtime of fetv 
we have leveraged the fetv assets to produce high quality tv programming focused on tourism  successfully promoting our own tourist attractions branding the fetv station around the tourism theme and creating a network of potential partners for our tourism business  including hotels  travel agents  and entertainment resorts 
tourism tourism revenue increased by approximately million or approximately from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december   including approximately million from great golden lake resort  million from yunding park  and million from hua an tulou 
the primary resources of the revenues are entrance fees  tour shuttle bus fees  and restaurants 
the tourism revenue remains steady 
cost of revenue cost of revenues decreased by approximately million or approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to a decrease in cost of revenue of advertisement  partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue of tourism 
advertisement cost of revenue from advertisement decreased by approximately million or approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the railway media clients demanded less broadcast programs due to the instability of the railway broadcasting  so the decrease in cost of media businesses was primarily due to the decrease of railway program productions 
also the business tax decreased along with the decrease in the company s advertising revenue 
tourism cost of revenue from tourism increased by approximately million or approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in depreciation cost for the new construction completed for tourism destinations 
gross profit gross profit decreased approximately million  or approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  our gross profit margin was approximately for the year ended december   compared to approximately for the year ended december   representing a decrease of approximately basis points 
advertisement gross profit from advertisement decreased by approximately million  or approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  gross profit margin from advertisement was approximately for the year ended december   compared to approximately for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the instability of revenue generated from the railway media broadcasts during the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december  and that the fixed costs associated with fetv s commercial airtime remained constant 
tourism gross profit from tourism increased by approximately million  or approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  gross profit margin from tourism was approximately for the year ended december   compared to approximately for the year ended december  the decrease of gross profit margin was primarily attributable to fixed cost derived from depreciation of property and equipment at tourism destinations that remained steady despite the slight increase in tourism revenue  as well as increase in depreciation cost for the new construction completed for tourism destinations 
selling expenses selling expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of approximately million  or approximately 
the increase in selling expense was primarily due to the increase in variable costs associated with the expansions at yunding park during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december   which represents a increase of approximately million  or approximately 
this increase was due to the increase of administrative expenses for the operation of new tourism destinations 
interest expense interest expense was approximately million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately million or approximately  compared to the approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily because more interest expenses associated with the bank loans incurred for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december   as well as expensing interests in the year ended december  after completion of construction of new tourism destinations as compared to capitalizing them during construction in the year ended december  income tax income tax was approximately million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of approximately million or approximately  compared to the approximately million income tax for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the lower revenue generated from the tulou tourism destination  as well as the decrease in the railway media revenue for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  the provision for income tax for the year ended december  was mainly derived from the net income before tax of the advertisement segment 
net income as a result of the above factors  we have net loss of approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of approximately million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of approximately million or approximately 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the lower revenue generated from the tulou tourism destination  as well as the decrease of the railway media revenue for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity during the year ended december  include cash from operations and proceeds from long term short term loans 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as compared to approximately million as of december   representing an increase of million 
our principal sources of liquidity during the year ended december  include cash from operations and proceeds from loans 
net proceeds from short term and long term loans for the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   our working capital deficit was approximately million  compared to working capital of approximately million as of december  the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years indicated for the years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to the net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to the net income of million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in expenditures on activities related to obtaining land use rights and on property for the new construction of tourism destinations 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was mainly because of more repayment of long term loans during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  bank loans as of december   the company had five bank loans from three institutional lenders for the development of the tourism destinations

principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of china yida and its wholly owned subsidiaries keenway limited  hong kong yi tat  fujian jintai  fuyu  hongda  fujian yida  yida tulou  anhui yida  yongtai yunding  zhangshu yida  fenyi yida  yida travel  fenyi development  bengbu yida  zhangshu development  zhangshu investment  bengbu investment  yida arts and the accounts of its variable interest entity  fujian jiaoguang 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
consolidation of variable interest entities according to the requirements of asc  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
that requires a variable interest entity vie  the company has evaluated the economic relationships of fujian jiaoguang which signed an exclusive right agreement with the company 
therefore  fujian jiaoguang is considered to be a vie  as defined by asc topic  of which the company is the primary beneficiary 
the carrying amount and classification of fujian jiaoguang s assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows december  december  total current assets total assets total current liabilities total liabilities including intercompany receivables of  and  as at december  and december   respectively  to be eliminated in consolidation 
including intercompany payables of  and  as at december  and december   respectively  to be eliminated in consolidation 
although fujian jiaoguang no longer had revenues  its bank account still has to be maintained active with certain cash flows to support its expenses 
as such  fujian jiaoguang transferred funds from and to the company s directly owned subsidiaries  which resulted in part of the intercompany receivables and payables 
another significant portion of the intercompany receivable recorded at fujian jiaoguang represented payments that fujian jiaoguang paid on behalf of jintai previously  which remained due from jintai 
nonetheless  since fujian jiaoguang is a variable interest entity subject to consolidation  the balances of its intercompany receivables and payables are eliminated against the corresponding account balances at the company s directly owned subsidiaries at the consolidation level 
use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  actual results could differ materially from those results 
the most significant estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements include depreciation  useful lives of property and equipment  deferred income taxes  useful life of intangible assets and contingencies 
estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
gains or losses on disposals are reflected as gain or loss in the year of disposal 
the cost of improvements that extends the life of property  and equipment are capitalized 
these capitalized costs may include structural improvements  equipment  and fixtures

the lease period of management right  commercial airtime rights and land use rights is years  years and years  respectively 
impairment the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
whenever any such impairment exists  an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows  the company measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows as the rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
the company estimates fair value based on the information available  judgments and projections are considered necessary 
there was no impairment of long lived assets as of december  and revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the date of service rendered to customers when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the services rendered  no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received before satisfaction of all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue 
revenues from advance tourism destinations ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used 
revenues from our contractors who have tourism contracts with us are generally recognized over the period of the applicable agreements commencing with the tourists visiting the tourism destinations 
the company also sells admission and activities tickets for a tourism destination which the company has the management right 
the company sells the television airtime to third parties 
the company records advertising sales when advertisements are aired 
the company has no allowance for product returns or sales discounts because services that are rendered and accepted by the customers are normally not refundable and discounts are normally not granted after service has been rendered 
profit sharing costs are recorded as cost of revenue

the company subsidiaries maintain their books and records in their functional currency  being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted 
in general  for consolidation purposes  the company translates the subsidiaries assets and liabilities into us dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates  and the statements of income are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods 
gain or loss on foreign currency transactions are reflected on the income statement

the functional currency of the company and its subsidiaries in china is the chinese renminbi 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the deferred income tax assets were and  as december  and  respectively 
the company applied the provisions of asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements 
audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed 
the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the company s liability for income taxes 
any such adjustment could be material to the company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based  in part  upon the results of operations for the given period 
at december   management considered that the company had no uncertain tax positions  and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future 
china yida is subject to us federal and california state examination by tax authorities for years after  and the prc tax authority for years after fair values of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for current assets and currently liabilities approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these financial instruments 
the carrying amount of long term loans approximates fair value since the interest rates associated with the debts approximate the current market interest rates 
the company adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements for both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
this standard defines fair value  provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures 
this standard does not require any new fair value measurements  but discusses valuation techniques  such as the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flows and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
for purposes of asc  nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities would include all assets and liabilities other than those meeting the definition of a financial asset or financial liability as defined in asc a 
stock based compensation the company records stock based compensation expense pursuant to asc  share based payment arrangement  which requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee requisite service period 
the company s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of company s stock or the expected volatility of similar entities 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post vesting termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
stock based compensation expense is recognized based on awards expected to vest  and there were no estimated forfeitures as the company has a short history of issuing options 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods  if necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements
