item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of therapeutic products for diseases such as diabetes 
our lead product candidate  afrezza  is an ultra rapid acting insulin therapy that is in late stage clinical investigation for the treatment of adults with type or type diabetes for the control of hyperglycemia 

table of contents we are a development stage enterprise and have incurred significant losses since our inception in as of december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of billion and a stockholders deficit of million 
to date  we have not generated any product revenues and have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities and borrowings under a loan arrangement provided by our principal stockholder 
as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  if we are unable to obtain additional funding in the future  there will continue to be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we do not expect to record sales of any product prior to regulatory approval and commercialization of afrezza 
we currently do not have the required approvals to market any of our product candidates  and we may not receive such approvals 
we may not be able to achieve positive cash flow from operations even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates 
we expect to make substantial expenditures and to incur additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue the clinical development of afrezza and new inhalation systems for the treatment of diabetes  seek regulatory approval to sell afrezza in the united states and other markets  seek development and commercialization collaborations for afrezza  and develop additional applications of our proprietary technosphere formulation technology for the pulmonary delivery of other drugs 
our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to the risks inherent in our ongoing clinical trials and the regulatory approval process  our potential inability to enter into sales and marketing collaborations or to commercialize afrezza in a timely manner  the results of our research and development efforts  competition from other products and technologies and uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist mainly of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval for marketing and for which no alternative future use has been identified 
this includes the salaries  benefits and stock based compensation of research and development personnel  raw materials  such as insulin purchases  laboratory supplies and materials  facility costs  costs for consultants and related contract research  licensing fees  and depreciation of equipment 
we track research and development costs by the type of cost incurred 
we partially offset research and development expenses with the recognition of estimated amounts receivable from the state of connecticut pursuant to a program under which we can exchange qualified research and development income tax credits for cash 
our research and development staff conducts our internal research and development activities  which include research  product development  clinical development  manufacturing and related activities 
this staff is located in our facilities in valencia  california  paramus  new jersey  and danbury  connecticut 
we expense research and development costs as we incur them 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we are focused primarily on advancing afrezza through regulatory filings 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates other than afrezza  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs that we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
the costs required to complete the development of afrezza will be largely dependent on the cost and efficiency of our clinical trial operations and discussions with the fda regarding its requirements 
during the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring to streamline operations  reduce operating expenses  extend our cash runway and focus our resources on securing fda approval of the nda for afrezza 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded charges to research and development expenses of approximately million for employee severance and other related termination benefits 
the restructuring 
table of contents resulted in research and development operating cost savings of approximately million in these savings were partially offset by increased costs associated with the additional trials required by the fda 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for administrative  finance  business development  human resources  legal and information systems support personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional service fees and business insurance costs 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded charges to general and administrative expenses of approximately million for employee severance and other related termination benefits 
the restructuring resulted in general and administrative operating cost savings of approximately million in these savings were offset primarily by increased professional fees 
critical accounting policies we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates of expenses such as stock option expenses and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in more detail below 
impairment of long lived assets assessing long lived assets for impairment requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we believe our assets to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset and an operating loss would be recognized 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the useful lives of the assets 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  our reported results could materially change 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses  and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan 
if we are unable to execute our business plan  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets in future periods 

table of contents clinical trial expenses our clinical trial accrual process seeks to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contract with vendors  consultants  and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts 
our objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in our financial statements by matching period expenses with period services and efforts expended 
we account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial 
we determine accrual estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials  or the services completed 
service provider status is then compared to the contractual obligated fee to be paid for such services 
during the course of a clinical trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of the services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc asc compensation stock compensation 
asc requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units  performance based awards and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the income statement based upon the fair value of the awards at the grant date 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans 
restricted stock units are valued based on the market price on the grant date 
we evaluate stock awards with performance conditions as to the probability that the performance conditions will be met and estimate the date at which the performance conditions will be met in order to properly recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period 
as of december   there was  and million of unrecognized expenses related to performance based options and restricted stock units  respectively  for milestones where achievement was not considered probable 
forward contracts in february and october  we entered into agreements with the mann group whereby we agreed to sell and the mann group agreed to purchase common stock and or warrants 
these agreements have been accounted for as forward contracts  having met the definition of derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of asc derivatives and hedging 
we determine the fair value of the forward contract upon its issuance  record fair value adjustments of the forward contract to other income expense during the reporting period and through the settlement of the forward contract  and reclassify the forward contract to equity upon settlement of the forward contract 
the fair value of the forward purchase contract is highly sensitive to the discount applied for lack of marketability and the stock price  and changes in this discount and or the stock price could cause the value of the forward purchase contract to change significantly 
accounting for income taxes we must make management judgments when determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we have established a valuation allowance of million against all of our net deferred tax asset balance  due to uncertainties related to the realizability of our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

in  manufacturing expenses decreased as no insulin purchases were made subsequent to the termination of our supply agreement in in  we paid million in connection with the settlement of the dispute arising from us terminating our supply agreement 
additionally  the february reduction in force resulted in million in salary related manufacturing cost savings partially offset by increased clinical distribution costs in support of our clinical trials 
decreased salary related expenses of million resulting from the february reduction in force and million in reduced purchased services primarily contributed to decreased research expenses in we anticipate that our overall research and development expenses will decrease in as we complete our clinical trials and prepare our resubmission for regulatory approval of afrezza

in  other income is primarily comprised of realized gains of million on the termination of foreign exchange hedging contracts related to our supply agreement with organon 
we terminated these contracts in the first quarter of interest income and expense interest expense for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the interest expense associated with additional principal drawn down and conversion of accrued and unpaid interest to principal in on our note payable to our principal stockholder

overall salary and employee related expenses increased in by million compared to the prior year as we did not record a bonus accrual for these increases were offset by the non recurrence in of projects conducted in  including market research studies 
stock based compensation expense increased in over the prior year due to retention grants awarded in the first quarter of other income expense other income for the year ended december  was million  which was primarily due to realized gains of million on the termination of foreign exchange hedging contracts related to our supply agreement with organon 
we terminated these contracts during the quarter ended march  for the year ended december   we recorded million of other expense  as we recognized a million other than temporary impairment loss on our common stock investment due to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis 
in addition  we recorded a loss of million on the execution of quarterly foreign exchange hedging contracts  offset by a reimbursement of million received in connection with a soil cleanup plan 
interest income and expense interest expense for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december   due to a full year of interest expense recorded on the convertible notes issued in august and related amortization of the debt issuance costs 
interest expense for the year ended december  also included interest related to additional amounts borrowed under the loan agreement with our principal stockholder 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and convertible debt securities and borrowings under our loan arrangement with our principal stockholder 
in october  we entered into a million loan arrangement with our principal stockholder 
in february  as a result of our principal stockholder being licensed as a finance lender under the california finance lenders law  the promissory note underlying the loan arrangement was revised to reflect the lender as the mann group llc  an entity controlled by our principal stockholder 
until january   interest on outstanding principal amounts accrued at a fixed rate equal to the one year london interbank offered rate libor rate as reported by the wall street journal on the date of such advance plus per annum 
the borrowing rate was at december  we amended the promissory note underlying the loan arrangement at various dates during the most recent amendment occurred in october to extend the maturity date to january   extend the date through which we can borrow under the promissory note to 
table of contents september   and adjust the annual interest rate on all outstanding principal to the one year libor rate on december  plus  effective beginning on january  as of december   the total principal amount outstanding under the credit facility was million  and the amount available for future borrowings was million 
interest is due and payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter for the preceding quarter  or at such other time as we and the mann group mutually agree 
all or any portion of accrued and unpaid interest that becomes due and payable may be paid in kind and capitalized at any time upon mutual agreement of both parties 
the mann group can require us to prepay up to million in advances that have been outstanding for at least months 
if the mann group exercises this right  we will have days after the mann group provides written notice or the number of days to maturity of the note if less than days to prepay such advances see discussion regarding letter agreement below 
in august  we entered into a letter agreement confirming a previous commitment by the mann group to not require us to prepay amounts outstanding under the amended and restated promissory note if the prepayment would require us to use its working capital resources 
in the event of a default  all unpaid principal and interest either becomes immediately due and payable or may be accelerated at the mann group s option  and the interest rate will increase to the one year libor rate calculated on the date of the initial advance or in effect on the date of default  whichever is greater  plus per annum 
all borrowings under the loan arrangement are unsecured 
the loan arrangement contains no financial covenants 
there are no warrants associated with the loan arrangement 
on february   we sold million worth of units in an underwritten public offering  with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  and reflects the full exercise of an over allotment option granted to the underwriters 
net proceeds from this offering were approximately million excluding discounts and commissions to the underwriters and offering expenses  excluding any warrant exercises 
concurrent with this public offering  the mann group llc agreed to purchase million worth of restricted shares of common stock which were issued on june  in exchange for cancellation of principal indebtedness of million 
in connection with this purchase  we and the mann group agreed that the cancelled principal amount related to the common stock purchase would be permanently retired and not available for re borrowing and accrued and unpaid interest that becomes due and payable under the note to be paid in kind and capitalized into new principal indebtedness upon agreement of the parties under the amended and restated promissory note dated june  we capitalized into new principal indebtedness an aggregate of approximately million of accrued and unpaid interest due and payable as of june  in october  we sold in an underwritten public offering  shares of its common stock  together with  warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
in addition  we sold pursuant to the full exercise of an over allotment option granted to the underwriters  an additional  shares of common stock  together with  warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the shares of common stock were sold together with a warrant for a combined purchase price of 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting discounts and commissions to the underwriters and offering expenses  excluding any future proceeds from the exercise of the warrants 
each warrant entitles the holder to purchase of a share of common stock 
the warrants are exercisable at per share and will expire in october concurrently with the underwritten public offering  the mann group agreed to purchase million worth of restricted shares of common stock and restricted warrants to purchase restricted shares of common stock in exchange for cancellation of principal under the amended and restated promissory note held by the mann group 
on october   we amended and restated the existing promissory note evidencing the loan arrangement with the mann group to extend the maturity date from march  to january   extend the date through which we can borrow under the note to september   adjust the annual interest rate on all outstanding principal to the one year libor rate on december  plus  effective beginning on january  following the approval by our stockholders in december to increase our authorized shares of common stock  we completed the closing under the mann group common stock and warrant purchase agreement 
following the cancellation of the principal amount and the capitalization of the accrued and unpaid interest  the total principal amount outstanding under the amended and restated promissory note was million  and we had million available for borrowing under such note 

table of contents during the year ended december   we used million of cash for our operations and had a net loss of million  which included million of non cash charges primarily consisting of depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  fair value of forward purchase contracts and common stock issued pursuant to litigation settlement 
by comparison  during the year ended december   we used million of cash for our operations and had a net loss of million  which included million of non cash charges primarily consisting of depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation 
the operating cash flow increased by million primarily due to increased accrued expenses associated with the clinical trials 
cash used for our operations for the year ended december  decreased by million compared to cash used for our operations for the year ended december  primarily due to the non recurring payment related to the termination of our insulin supply agreement during  offset by increased clinical trial expenditures during we expect our negative operating cash flow to continue at least until we obtain regulatory approval and achieve commercialization of afrezza 
we used  of cash for investing activities during the year ended december   as compared to million of cash used for the year ended december  cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year decreased million  primarily due to a million decrease in purchases of machinery and equipment  offset by the non recurrence of million in proceeds received in from the early termination of certificates of deposit that were previously held as collateral for foreign exchange hedging instruments 
in  we purchased million of machinery and equipment to expand our manufacturing operations and our quality systems that support clinical trials for afrezza as compared to million of machinery and equipment purchased in our financing activities generated million of cash for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was primarily from million in net aggregate proceeds received from the sale of stock and warrants pursuant to two underwritten public offerings and million in borrowings from the mann group loan arrangement 
in february  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of  units in an underwritten public offering  including  units sold pursuant to the full exercise of an over allotment option granted to the underwriters  with one unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  for a combined price of per unit to the public and per unit to the underwriters 
in october  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock  together with  warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  for a combined purchase price of per share and warrant 
for the year ended december   cash from financing activities was primarily from million of related party borrowings and million related to the sale of common stock during the first quarter of as well as exercise of stock options  and shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe our existing cash resources  including the amount available to borrow under our loan arrangement with the mann group  as amended  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements through at least the third quarter of the million aggregate principal amount of notes mature in december  and our cash and cash equivalents as of december  were insufficient to repay these notes 
accordingly  we will need to raise additional capital  either through the sale of equity or debt securities  the entry into a strategic business collaboration with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company  the establishment of other funding facilities  licensing arrangements  asset sales or other means  and or refinance our indebtedness under the notes  in order to continue the development and commercialization of afrezza and other product candidates and to support our other ongoing activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on favorable terms by the applicable repayment date  or at all 
in addition  if we undergo a fundamental change  as that term is defined in the indentures governing the terms of the notes  each holder of notes will have the option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of such holder s notes at a repurchase price of of the principal amount of such notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  up to and including the noteholders initiating bankruptcy proceedings or causing us to cease operations altogether 
this raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 

table of contents we intend to use our capital resources to continue the development and commercialization of afrezza  if approved 
we are expending a portion of our capital to scale up our manufacturing capabilities in our danbury facilities 
we also intend to use our capital resources for general corporate purposes 
we have held extensive discussions with a number of pharmaceutical companies concerning a potential strategic business collaboration for afrezza 
we cannot predict when  if ever  we could conclude an agreement with a partner 
there can be no assurance that any such collaboration will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we enter into a strategic business collaboration with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company  we would expect  as part of the transaction  to receive additional capital 
in addition  we expect to pursue the sale of equity and or debt securities  or the establishment of other funding facilities 
issuances of debt or additional equity could impact the rights of our existing stockholders  dilute the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders and may impose restrictions on our operations 
these restrictions could include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
we also may seek to raise additional capital by pursuing opportunities for the licensing  sale or divestiture of certain intellectual property and other assets  including our technosphere technology platform 
there can be no assurance  however  that any strategic collaboration  sale of securities or sale or license of assets will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be required to enter into agreements with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we otherwise would have sought to develop independently  and any such agreements may not be on terms as commercially favorable to us 
however  we cannot provide assurances that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate 
if planned operating results are not achieved or we are not successful in raising additional capital through equity or debt financing or entering a business collaboration  we may be required to reduce expenses through the delay  reduction or curtailment of our projects  including afrezza development activities  or further reduction of costs for facilities and administration  and there will continue to be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments and contingencies our contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
accordingly  the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties  all of which are contingent upon certain future events 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
future payments relate to operating lease obligations  the senior convertible notes  and open purchase order and supply commitments consisted of the following at december  in thousands payments due in contractual obligations less than one year years years more than years total open purchase order and supply commitments senior convertible notes note payable to principal stockholder operating lease obligations total contractual obligations the amounts included in open purchase order and supply commitments are subject to performance under the purchase order or contract by the supplier of the goods or services and do not become our obligation until such performance is rendered 
the amount shown is principally for the purchase of materials for our clinical trials  the acquisition of manufacturing equipment  and commitments related to the expansion of our manufacturing plant 

table of contents the senior convertible notes obligations include the notes and the notes 
the amounts include future interest payments at fixed rates of and  respectively  and payment of the notes in full upon maturity in and  respectively 
the obligation for the note payable to the principal stockholder includes future principal and interest payments related to the million of borrowings as of december  interest is paid based on a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate on december  plus and the principal payment is due on january  related party transactions for a description of our related party transactions see note related party arrangements in the notes to our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates impacting our short term investment portfolio as well as the interest rate on the promissory note underlying our revolving credit facility with the mann group 
the interest rate on amounts borrowed under our credit facility with the mann group for the year ended december  was a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate as reported by the wall street journal on the date of such advance plus per annum 
pursuant to an amendment to the promissory note in october  as of january  the interest rate on all outstanding principal amounts under our credit facility with the mann group was adjusted to the one year libor on december  plus 
as of december   the total principal amount outstanding under the credit facility was million 
in addition  all borrowings under the credit facility for periods on and after january  bear interest at the one year libor on december  plus 
our current policy requires us to maintain a highly liquid short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market funds and investment grade corporate  government and municipal debt 
none of these investments is entered into for trading purposes 
our cash is deposited in and 
table of contents invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
we continue to utilize our million revolving credit facility with the mann group to fund operations 
as of december   the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility with the mann group was million 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the value of our short term investment portfolio or on our interest expense obligations with respect to outstanding borrowed amounts under our revolving credit facility
