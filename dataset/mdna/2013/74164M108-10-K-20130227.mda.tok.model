item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to inform the reader about matters affecting the financial condition and results of operations of primerica  inc the parent company and its subsidiaries collectively  we  us or the company for the three year period ended december  as a result  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying notes that are included herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that constitute our plans  estimates and beliefs 
these forward looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
this md a is divided into the following sections business trends and conditions factors affecting our results critical accounting estimates the april transactions results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital resources business trends and conditions the relative strength and stability of financial markets and economies in the united states and canada affect our growth and profitability 
our business is  and we expect will continue to be  influenced by a number of industry wide and product specific trends and conditions 
economic conditions  including high unemployment levels and low levels of consumer confidence  influence investment and spending decisions by middle income consumers  our primary clients 
these conditions and factors also impact prospective recruits perceptions of the business opportunity that becoming a primerica sales representative offers  which can drive or dampen recruiting 
consumer spending and borrowing levels remain under pressure  as consumers take a more conservative financial posture  including reevaluating their savings and debt management goals 
as overall market and economic conditions have improved and stabilized from the lows experienced during the recent economic downturn  sales and the value of consumer investment products across a wide spectrum of asset classes have improved 
recruiting and sales representatives 
recruiting declined in to  new recruits from  new recruits in  due primarily to the strong prior year recruiting surge that followed the announcement of short term recruiting incentives at our june biennial sales force convention 
our ability to increase the size of our sales force is largely based on the success of our recruiting efforts and our ability to train and motivate recruits to get licensed 
we believe that recruiting levels are an important advance indicator of sales force trends  and growth in recruiting is usually indicative of future growth in the overall size of the sales force 
however  because new recruits do not always obtain licenses  recruiting results do not always result in commensurate increases in the size of our licensed sales force 
the size of our life licensed sales force increased to  sales representatives as of december  from  sales representatives at december  primarily due to an increase in the licensing pull through rate 
the improvement in the license pull through rate was driven by our efforts to balance the emphasis on recruiting and licensing in both our messaging and incentive programs  as well as the introduction of streamlined life licensing processes for new recruits 
term life insurance product sales and face amount in force 
we issued  new life insurance policies in compared with  new policies in sales of our term life insurance products typically correlate with the size of our sales force and term life insurance product sales were lower than in largely as a result of the post convention recruiting surge in the prior year 
our average issued face amount was approximately  in compared with approximately  in the decrease is mostly attributable to a higher mix of policies issued through termnow  our rapid issue term life insurance product with policy face amounts of  and below 
total face amount in force increased to approximately 
table of contents billion as of december  compared with approximately billion at december  as new policies issued outpaced terminations 
investment and savings product sales and asset values 
investment and savings products sales were higher in  totaling approximately billion  compared with approximately billion in the increase in sales was largely attributable to new product introductions and increased demand for our existing products 
the assets in our clients accounts are invested in diversified funds comprised mainly of us and canadian equity and fixed income securities 
the average value of assets in client accounts increased to approximately billion in from approximately billion in  while the period end asset value increased to approximately billion at december  compared with approximately billion a year ago 
the increases both in period end asset values and average client asset values were attributable to improved market conditions and higher product sales 
invested asset portfolio size and yields 
our portfolio continues to reflect strong market value gains as interest rates and spreads continue to remain low 
as of december   our invested assets  excluding policy loans and cash  had a cost or amortized cost basis of over billion and a net unrealized gain of million compared with approximately billion at cost or amortized cost and net unrealized gain of million at december  if interest rates remain at or near historically low levels  we anticipate the average yield of our portfolio  and therefore the investment income derived from our portfolio  to decrease as maturing fixed income investments will be replaced with purchases of lower yielding investments 
legal fees and litigation related expenses 
certain legal disputes have arisen that have required us to incur significant legal costs  such as attorney fees and other litigation related expenses 
unless the matters are resolved  we will continue to incur significant legal fees and litigation related expenses in future periods 
at this time  we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses related to these legal disputes 
for additional information  see note commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
factors affecting our results term life insurance segment 
our term life insurance segment results are primarily driven by sales  accuracy of our pricing assumptions  terms and use of reinsurance  investment income and expenses 
sales and policies in force 
sales of new term policies and the size and characteristics of our in force book of policies are vital to our results over the long term 
premium revenue is recognized as it is earned over the term of the policy and eligible acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized ratably with the level premiums of the underlying policies 
however  because we incur significant cash outflows at or about the time policies are issued  including the payment of sales commissions and underwriting costs  changes in life insurance sales volume will have a more immediate effect on our cash flows 
historically  we have found that while sales volume of term life insurance products between fiscal periods may vary based on a variety of factors  the productivity of our individual sales representatives remains within a relatively narrow range and  consequently  our sales volume over the longer term generally correlates to the size of our sales force 
the average number of life licensed sales representatives and the number of term life insurance policies issued  as well as the average monthly rate of new policies issued per life licensed sales representative  were as follows year ended december  average number of life licensed sales representatives number of new policies issued average monthly rate of new policies issued per life licensed sales representative x x x our processing cycle provided five additional days of policy processing 
excluding the policies processed during these additional days  the average monthly rate of new policies issued per life licensed sales representative would have been x for during  the average monthly rate of new policies issued per life licensed sales representative declined in comparison to the prior year primarily due to the post convention recruiting surge that generated significant sales referrals and opportunities in the increased productivity of our individual sales representatives in compared to was driven primarily by the post convention recruiting surge and sales of our termnow product  which was introduced during the year 
as a result of these two factors  productivity for was at the high end of our historical range 
pricing assumptions 
our pricing methodology is intended to provide us with appropriate profit margins for the risks we assume 
we determine pricing classifications based on the coverage sought  such as the size and term of the policy  and 
table of contents certain policyholder attributes  such as age and health 
in addition  we utilize unisex rates for our term life insurance policies 
the pricing assumptions that underlie our rates are based upon our best estimates of mortality  persistency and investment yields at the time of issuance  sales force commission rates  issue and underwriting expenses  operating expenses and the characteristics of the insureds  including sex  age  underwriting class  product and amount of coverage 
our results will be affected to the extent there is a variance between our pricing assumptions and actual experience 
persistency 
persistency is a measure of how long our insurance policies stay in force 
as a general matter  persistency that is lower than our pricing assumptions adversely affects our results over the long term because we lose the recurring revenue stream associated with the policies that lapse 
determining the near term effects of changes in persistency is more complicated 
when persistency is lower than our pricing assumptions  we must accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
the resultant increase in amortization expense is offset by a corresponding release of reserves associated with lapsed policies  which causes a reduction in benefits and claims expense 
the reserves associated with any given policy will change over the term of such policy 
as a general matter  reserves are lowest at the inception of a policy term and rise steadily to a peak before declining to zero at the expiration of the policy term 
accordingly  depending on when the lapse occurs in relation to the overall policy term  the reduction in benefits and claims expense may be greater or less than the increase in amortization expense and  consequently  the effects on earnings for a given period could be positive or negative 
persistency levels will impact results to the extent actual experience deviates from the persistency assumptions used to price our products 
mortality 
our profitability is affected to the extent actual mortality rates differ from those used in our pricing assumptions 
we mitigate a significant portion of our mortality exposure through reinsurance 
investment yields 
we use investment yield rates based on yields available at the time a policy is issued 
for policies issued in and after  we have been using an increasing interest rate assumption to reflect the historically low interest rate environment 
both dac and the reserve liability increase with the assumed investment yield rate 
since dac is higher than the reserve liability in the early years of a policy  a lower assumed investment yield generally will result in lower profits 
in the later years  when the reserve liability is higher than dac  a lower assumed investment yield generally will result in higher profits 
these assumed investment yields  which like other pricing assumptions are locked in at issue  impact the timing but not the aggregate amount of dac and reserve changes 
actual investment yields will impact net investment income allocated to the term life insurance segment  but will not impact dac or the reserve liability 
reinsurance 
we use reinsurance extensively  which has a significant effect on our results of operations 
since the mid s  we have reinsured between and of the mortality risk on our us term life insurance policies on a quota share yearly renewable term yrt basis 
in canada  we previously utilized reinsurance arrangements similar to the us in certain years and reinsured only face amounts above  in other years 
however  in the first quarter of  we entered into a yrt reinsurance arrangement in canada similar to our us program that reinsures of the face amount for every policy sold 
yrt reinsurance permits us to set future mortality at contractual rates by policy class 
to the extent actual mortality experience is more or less favorable than the contractual rate  the reinsurer will earn incremental profits or bear the incremental cost  as applicable 
in contrast to coinsurance  which is intended to eliminate all risks other than counterparty risk of the reinsurer and rewards associated with a specified percentage of the block of policies subject to the reinsurance arrangement  the yrt reinsurance arrangements we enter into are intended only to reduce volatility associated with variances between estimated and actual mortality rates 
the effect of our reinsurance arrangements on ceded premiums and benefits and expenses on our statement of income follows ceded premiums 
ceded premiums are the premiums we pay to reinsurers 
these amounts are deducted from the direct premiums we earn to calculate our net premium revenues 
similar to direct premium revenues  ceded coinsurance premiums remain level over the initial term of the insurance policy 
ceded yrt premiums increase over the period that the policy has been in force 
accordingly  ceded yrt premiums generally constitute an increasing percentage of direct premiums over the policy term 
benefits and claims 
benefits and claims include incurred claim amounts and changes in future policy benefit reserves 
reinsurance reduces incurred claims in direct proportion to the percentage ceded 
coinsurance also reduces the change in future policy benefit reserves in direct proportion to the percentage ceded while yrt reinsurance does not significantly impact benefit reserves 
amortization of dac 
amortization of dac is reduced on a pro rata basis for the coinsured business  including the business reinsured with citigroup inc citigroup 
there is no impact on amortization of dac associated with our yrt contracts 
insurance expenses 
insurance expenses are reduced by the allowances received from coinsurance  including the business reinsured with citigroup 
there is no impact on insurance expenses associated with our yrt contracts 

table of contents we may alter our reinsurance practices at any time due to the unavailability of yrt reinsurance at attractive rates or the availability of alternatives to reduce our risk exposure 
we presently intend to continue ceding approximately of our us mortality risk on new business and approximately of our canadian mortality risk on new business 
net investment income 
term life insurance segment net investment income is composed of two elements allocated net investment income and the market return associated with the deposit asset underlying the reinsurance agreement we executed in connection with our corporate reorganization 
invested assets are allocated to the term life segment based on the book value of the invested assets necessary to meet statutory reserve requirements and our targeted capital objectives 
net investment income is also impacted by the performance of our invested asset portfolio and the market return on the deposit asset which can be affected by interest rates  credit spreads and the mix of invested assets 
expenses 
results are also affected by variances in client acquisition  maintenance and administration expense levels 
investment and savings products segment 
our investment and savings products segment results are primarily driven by sales  the value of assets in client accounts for which we earn ongoing management  service and distribution fees and the number of fee generating accounts we administer 
sales 
we earn commissions and fees  such as dealer re allowances  and marketing and support fees  based on sales of mutual fund and managed account products and annuities 
sales of investment and savings products are influenced by the overall demand for investment products in the united states and canada  as well as by the size and productivity of our sales force 
we generally experience seasonality in our investment and savings products segment results due to our high concentration of sales of retirement account products 
these accounts are typically funded in february through april  coincident with our clients tax return preparation season 
while we believe the size of our sales force is a factor in driving sales volume in this segment  there are a number of other variables  such as economic and market conditions  which may have a significantly greater effect on sales volume in any given fiscal period 
asset values in client accounts 
we earn marketing and distribution fees trail commissions or  with respect to us mutual funds  b fees on mutual fund and annuity assets in the united states and canada 
in the united states  we also earn investment advisory fees on assets in the managed accounts program 
in canada  we earn management fees on certain mutual fund assets and on the segregated funds for which we serve as investment manager 
asset values are influenced by new product sales  ongoing contributions to existing accounts  redemptions and the change in market values in existing accounts 
while we offer a wide variety of asset classes and investment styles  our clients accounts are primarily invested in equity funds 
accounts 
we earn recordkeeping fees for administrative functions we perform on behalf of several of our retail and managed mutual fund providers and custodial fees for services as a non bank custodian for certain of our clients retirement plan accounts 
sales mix 
while our investment and savings products all have similar long term earnings characteristics  our results in a given fiscal period will be affected by changes in the overall mix of products within these broad categories 
examples of changes in the sales mix that influence our results include the following sales of a higher proportion of mutual fund products of the several mutual fund families for which we act as recordkeeper will generally increase our earnings because we are entitled to recordkeeping fees on these accounts  sales of annuity products in the united states will generate higher revenues in the period such sales occur than sales of other investment products that either generate lower upfront revenues or  in the case of managed accounts and segregated funds  no upfront revenues  sales and administration of a higher proportion of mutual funds that enable us to earn marketing and support fees will increase our revenues and profitability  sales of a higher proportion of retirement products of several mutual fund families will tend to result in higher revenue generation due to our ability to earn custodial fees on these accounts  and sales of a higher proportion of managed accounts and segregated funds products will generally extend the time over which revenues can be earned because we are entitled to higher revenues based on assets under management for these accounts in lieu of upfront revenues 
corporate and other distributed products segment 
we earn revenues and pay commissions and referral fees for various other insurance products  prepaid legal services and other financial products  all of which are originated by third parties 
nblic also underwrites a mail order student life policy and a short term disability benefit policy  neither of which is distributed by our sales force  and has in force policies from several discontinued lines of insurance 
the corporate and other distributed products segment is affected by corporate income and expenses not allocated to our other segments  net investment income other than net investment income allocated to our term life insurance 
table of contents segment  claims experience for policies underwritten by nblic  general and administrative expenses other than expenses that are allocated to our term life insurance or investment and savings products segments  equity awards granted to management and our sales force leaders at the time of our initial public offering  interest expense on notes payable  and realized gains and losses on our invested asset portfolio 
capital structure 
our financial results have also been affected by changes in our capital structure that have occurred since our corporate reorganization in  including the issuance of the million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued in the senior notes and repayment of the note payable to citigroup  share repurchases  and other financing arrangements 
see note notes payable  note stockholders equity and note commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated and combined financial statements for more information on changes in our capital structure 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
these principles are established primarily by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations 
our significant accounting policies are described in note description of business  basis of presentation  and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
the most significant items on the balance sheet are based on fair value determinations  accounting estimates and actuarial determinations  which are susceptible to changes in future periods and could affect our results of operations and financial position 
the estimates that we deem to be most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial position are those related to the valuation of investments  dac  future policy benefit reserves and corresponding amounts due from reinsurers  litigation  and income taxes 
the preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management s analyses and judgments 
subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results 
invested assets we hold primarily fixed maturity securities  including bonds and redeemable preferred stocks  and equity securities  including common and non redeemable preferred stock 
we have classified these invested assets as available for sale  except for the securities of our us broker dealer subsidiary  which we have classified as trading securities 
all of these securities are carried at fair value 
fair value 
fair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information 
we classify and disclose all invested assets carried at fair value in one of the three categories prescribed by accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurement 
as of each reporting period  we classify all invested assets in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
significant levels of estimation and judgment are required to determine the fair value of certain of our investments 
the factors influencing these estimations and judgments are subject to change in subsequent reporting periods 
for additional information  see note description of business  basis of presentation  and summary of significant accounting policies  note investments and note fair value of financial instruments to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
other than temporary impairments 
we recognize unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale portfolio as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary is subjective 
furthermore  this determination can involve a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for invested assets that are not actively traded in established markets 
we evaluate a number of factors when determining the impairment status of individual securities 
these factors include the economic condition of various industry segments and geographic locations and other areas of identified risk 
for available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position that we intend to sell or would more likely than not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis  we recognize an impairment charge for the difference between amortized cost and fair value as a realized investment loss in our statements of income 
for available 
table of contents for sale securities in an unrealized loss position for which we have no intent to sell and believe that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis  only the credit loss component of the difference between cost and fair value is recognized in earnings  while the remainder is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security 
for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows  including asset backed securities  we periodically update our best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
securities that are in an unrealized loss position are reviewed at least quarterly for other than temporary impairment 
if the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its cost or amortized cost and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized 
estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral 
projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral 
other categories of fixed income securities that are in an unrealized loss position are also reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an other than temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors 
we consider a number of factors in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
these include actions taken by rating agencies  default by the issuer  the significance of the decline  the intent to sell and the ability to hold the investment until recovery of the amortized cost basis  as noted above  the time period during which the decline has occurred  an economic analysis of the issuer  the financial strength  liquidity  and recoverability of the issuer  and an analysis of the underlying collateral 
although no set formula is used in this process  the investment performance  collateral position  and continued viability of the issuer are significant measures that are considered 
the other than temporary impairment analysis that we perform on our equity securities primarily focuses on the severity of the unrealized loss as well as the length of time the security s fair value has been below amortized cost 
other than temporary impairment analyses that we perform involve the use of estimates  assumptions  and subjectivity 
if these factors or future events change  we could experience material other than temporary impairments in future periods  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and the size and quality of our invested assets portfolio 
for additional information  see note description of business  basis of presentation  and summary of significant accounting policies and note investments to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs we defer incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions that result directly from and are essential to the contract transaction s and that would not have been incurred had the contract transaction s not occurred 
these costs mainly include commissions and policy issue expenses 
the recovery of such costs is dependent on the future profitability of the related policies  which  in turn  is dependent principally upon mortality  persistency  the expense of administering the business  and investment returns  as well as upon certain economic variables  such as inflation 
dac is subject to recoverability testing annually and when circumstances indicate that recoverability is uncertain 
we make certain assumptions regarding persistency  expenses  interest rates and claims 
these assumptions may not be modified  or unlocked  unless recoverability testing deems them to be inadequate 
we update assumptions for new business to reflect the most recent experience 
deferrable term life insurance policy acquisition costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to premium income 
if actual lapses or withdrawals are different from pricing assumptions for a particular period  dac amortization will be affected 
if the rate of policies that lapse are higher than the rate of policies that we expected to lapse in our pricing assumptions  approximately more of the existing dac balance will be amortized  which would have been equal to approximately million as of december  assuming such lapses were distributed proportionately among policies of all durations 
we believe that a lapse rate in the number of policies that is higher than the rate assumed in our pricing assumptions is a reasonably possible variation 
higher lapses in the 
table of contents early durations would have a greater effect on dac amortization since the dac balances are higher at the earlier durations 
differences in actual mortality rates compared to our pricing assumptions will not have a material effect on dac amortization 
due to the inherent uncertainties in making assumptions about future events  materially different experience from expected results in persistency or mortality could result in a material increase or decrease of dac amortization in a particular period 
deferrable acquisition costs for canadian segregated funds are amortized over the life of the policies in relation to historical and future estimated gross profits before amortization 
the gross profits and resulting dac amortization will vary with actual fund returns  redemptions and expenses 
for additional information on dac  see note description of business  basis of presentation  and summary of significant accounting policies and note deferred policy acquisition costs to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
future policy benefits and reinsurance we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders based on actuarial assumptions and in accordance with industry practice and us gaap 
liabilities for future policy benefits on our term life insurance products have been computed using a net level method  including assumptions as to investment yields  mortality  persistency  and other assumptions based on our experience 
many factors can affect these reserves  including mortality trends  investment yields and persistency 
similar to the dac discussion above  we cannot modify the assumptions used to establish reserves during the policy term unless recoverability testing deems them to be inadequate 
therefore  the reserves we establish are based on estimates  assumptions and our analysis of historical experience 
our results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our reserves and pricing our products 
our reserve assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and  therefore  are inherently uncertain 
if actual lapses are different from pricing assumptions for a particular period  the change in the future policy benefits  which is reflected in benefits and claims in our statements of income  will be affected 
we use reinsurance extensively 
we determine if a contract provides indemnification against loss or liability in relation to the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject 
we review all contractual terms  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject that may delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if we determine that the possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk will occur only under remote circumstances  we record the contract under the deposit method of accounting with the net amount receivable reflected in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance premiums  commissions  expense reimbursements  benefits  and reserves related to reinsured long duration contracts are accounted for over the life of the underlying contracts using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies 
we analyze and monitor the creditworthiness of each of our reinsurers to minimize collection issues 
if the rate of policies that lapse are higher than the rate of policies that we expected to lapse in our pricing assumptions  approximately more of the future policy benefit reserves will be released  which would have been equal to approximately million as of december  assuming such lapses were distributed proportionately among policies of all durations 
the future policy benefit reserves released from the additional lapses would have been partially offset by the release of the corresponding due from reinsurers asset of approximately million as of december  higher lapses in later durations would have a greater effect on the release of future policy benefit reserves since the future policy benefit reserves are higher at the later durations 
differences in actual mortality rates compared to our pricing assumptions will not have a material effect on future policy benefit reserves 
we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments 
for additional information on future policy benefits and reinsurance  see note description of business  basis of presentation  and summary of significant accounting policies and note reinsurance to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
litigation the company is involved from time to time in legal disputes  regulatory inquiries and arbitration proceedings in the normal course of business 
these disputes are subject to uncertainties  including indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation 
we recognize losses for legal contingencies when payments associated with the contingency become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty of estimating litigation outcomes  actual costs may be substantially higher or lower than any amounts reserved 
legal costs  such as attorney fees and other litigation related expenses  that are incurred in connection with litigation are expensed as incurred 

table of contents for additional information on contingent liabilities  see note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to i differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and ii operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management s judgment that realization is more likely than not applicable to the periods in which we expect the temporary difference will reverse 
in light of the multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate  our tax returns are subject to routine audit by the internal revenue service irs and other taxation authorities 
the results of these audits at times produce uncertainty regarding particular tax positions taken in the year s of review 
the company records uncertain tax positions as prescribed by asc topic  income taxes  which requires recognition at the time when it is more likely than not that the position in question will be upheld 
although management believes that the judgment and estimates involved are reasonable and that the necessary provisions have been recorded  changes in circumstances or unexpected events could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
for additional information on income taxes  see note description of business  basis of presentation  and summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
the april transactions we refer to the corporate reorganization  the reinsurance transactions  the concurrent transactions and the private sale described below collectively as the april transactions 
the corporate reorganization 
the parent company was incorporated in delaware in october by citigroup to serve as a holding company for the life insurance and financial products distribution businesses that we have operated for more than years 
at such time  we issued shares of common stock to citigroup 
these businesses  which prior to april   were wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of citigroup  were transferred to us in a reorganization pursuant to which we issued to a wholly owned subsidiary of citigroup i  shares of our common stock of which  shares of common stock were subsequently sold by citigroup in our ipo   shares of common stock were subsequently sold by citigroup in mid april to certain private equity funds managed by warburg pincus llc warburg pincus for a purchase price of million the private sale  and  shares of common stock were immediately contributed back to us for equity awards granted to our employees and sales force leaders in connection with our ipo  ii warrants to purchase from us an aggregate of  shares of our common stock which were transferred by citigroup to warburg pincus pursuant to the private sale  and iii a million note payable due on march  bearing interest at an annual rate of the citigroup note 
prior to april   we had no material assets or liabilities 
upon completion of the april transactions  the parent company primary asset was and continues to be the capital stock of its operating subsidiaries  and its primary liability was the citigroup note 
the reinsurance transactions 
in march  we entered into coinsurance agreements the citigroup reinsurance agreements with two affiliates of citigroup and prime reinsurance company  inc prime re  then a wholly owned subsidiary of primerica life insurance company primerica life collectively  the citigroup reinsurers 
we refer to the execution of these agreements as the citigroup reinsurance transactions 
under these agreements  we ceded between and of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year end we also transferred to the citigroup reinsurers the account balances in respect of the coinsured policies and approximately billion of assets to support the statutory liabilities assumed by the citigroup reinsurers  and we distributed to citigroup all of the issued and outstanding common stock of prime re 
as a result  the citigroup reinsurance transactions reduced the amount of our capital and substantially reduced our insurance exposure 
we retained our operating platform and infrastructure and continue to administer all policies subject to these coinsurance agreements 
the concurrent transactions 
during the first quarter of  we declared distributions to citigroup of approximately million 
we also recognized the income attributable to the policies underlying the citigroup reinsurance transactions as well as the income earned on the invested assets backing the reinsurance balances and the extraordinary dividends declared in the first quarter 
these items were reflected in the statement of income for the three months ended march  furthermore  because the citigroup reinsurance transactions were given retroactive effect back to january   we recognized a return of capital on our balance sheet for the income earned on the reinsured policies during the three 
table of contents months ended march  in april  we completed the following additional concurrent transactions we completed the ipo pursuant to the securities act of  as amended  and our stock began trading under the ticker symbol pri on the nyse  we issued equity awards for  shares of our common stock to certain of our employees  including our officers  and certain of our sales force leaders  including  shares which were issued upon conversion of existing equity awards in citigroup shares that had not yet fully vested  and citigroup accelerated vesting of certain existing citigroup equity awards triggered by the ipo and the private sale 
additionally  we made elections with an effective date of april  under section h of the internal revenue code the section h elections  which resulted in reductions to stockholders equity of million and corresponding adjustments to deferred tax balances 
during the first quarter of  our federal income tax return was included as part of citigroup s consolidated federal income tax return 
on march   in anticipation of our corporate reorganization  we entered into a tax separation agreement with citigroup 
in accordance with the tax separation agreement  citigroup is responsible for  and shall indemnify and hold the company harmless from and against  any consolidated  combined  affiliated  unitary or similar federal  state or local income tax liability with respect to the company for any taxable period ending on or before april   the closing date of the ipo 
the private sale 
in february  citigroup entered into a securities purchase agreement with warburg pincus and us pursuant to which  in mid april  citigroup sold to warburg pincus  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase from us  additional shares of our common stock 
the warrants have a seven year term and an exercise price of per share 
period over period comparability 
due to the timing of these transactions and their impact on our financial position and results of operations  period over period comparisons will reflect significant non comparable accounting transactions and account balances 
the most significant accounting transaction was the reinsurance transactions described above  which affected both the size and composition of our balance sheet and statement of income 
additionally  the corporate reorganization and the concurrent transactions had a significant impact on the composition of our balance sheet 
as a result  our statements of income for the years ended december    and present income that is significantly lower than in from a statement of income perspective  the april transactions impacted ceded premiums  net premiums  net investment income  benefits and claims  amortization of dac  insurance commissions  insurance expenses  interest expense and income taxes 
actual results for periods ended prior to april  will not be indicative of or comparable to future actual results 
furthermore  actual results for the year ended december  will not be comparable to results in future years as they are affected by the inclusion of three months of operations prior to the april transactions

total revenues 
during  total revenues increased due primarily to growth in the term life insurance segment 
this increase largely reflects incremental premiums on new term life insurance policies issued subsequent to the citigroup reinsurance transactions new term 
the company also experienced an increase in commissions and fees revenue largely driven by higher sales and higher client asset values in our investment and savings product segment in the reduction in the average size of our invested asset portfolio largely contributed to the decrease in net investment income for realized investment gains were higher due to income received from certain fixed income securities that were tendered and gains from sales of invested assets to fund share repurchases during total benefits and expenses 
total benefits and expenses increased in primarily as a result of the growth in premium related costs  which include benefits and claims  dac amortization  and insurance expenses from the continued growth in our term life business 
in addition  sales commissions on investment products were higher consistent with the increase in commissions and fees revenue noted above 
these increased costs were partially offset by lower non deferrable insurance commissions for  which were attributable to changes in incentive programs for our sales representatives during that more directly relate to life policy acquisitions 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in and in the lower effective income tax rate during versus was primarily driven by decreasing canadian statutory income tax rates combined with capital planning decisions to permanently reinvest certain unremitted canadian earnings

table of contents term life insurance segment 
our actual results for the term life insurance segment for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  change dollars in thousands revenues direct premiums ceded premiums net premiums allocated net investment income other  net total revenues benefits and expenses benefits and claims amortization of dac insurance expenses insurance commissions interest expense total benefits and expenses income before income taxes net premiums 
the increase in net premiums in is primarily due to the continued addition of new term in force business combined with the run off of business subject to the citigroup reinsurance transactions 
while ceded premiums supporting yrt reinsurance programs for new term are less than of direct premiums  ceded premiums for the block of business coinsured by citigroup are more than of direct premiums 
as a result  as we continue to build new term and the block coinsured by citigroup continues to run off  net premiums will continue to grow faster than direct premiums  albeit at a declining rate of growth 
net premiums were also affected by ceded premium recovery transactions 
over the normal course of business  we reprocess a small portion of our reinsurance transactions that are either misprocessed or intentionally not processed on an automated basis due to system constraints 
in the second quarter of  the reprocessing of certain transactions resulted in an increase in net premiums of approximately million that was substantially offset by a corresponding increase in benefits and claims  contributing to the growth rate in benefits and claims outpacing the growth rate in net premiums 
net premium growth in was also partially offset by ceded premium recoveries of approximately million in the first quarter of allocated net investment income 
the increase in allocated net investment income was largely attributable to higher allocated term life invested assets to support increased statutory reserves from growth in new term business 
benefits and claims 
the increase in benefits and claims was largely indicative of growth in the term life business 
the growth rate in benefits and claims outpaced the increase in net premiums primarily as a result of higher incurred claims during and the reprocessed reinsurance transactions discussed above  partially offset by a charge of approximately million related to cumulative potential claims identified through cross checking public death records for deceased policyholders for whom claims had not been filed and of which we previously had been unaware 
amortization of dac 
the increase in amortization of dac was largely attributable to growth in new term business 
the growth in dac amortization was relatively consistent with the growth in net premiums year over year 
insurance commissions 
the decrease in insurance commissions was largely driven by changes to our agent incentive programs that resulted in a higher portion of commissions being deferred during compared to insurance expenses 
insurance expenses increased mainly due to higher premium related taxes  licenses and fees as well as the run off of expense allowances received under the citigroup reinsurance agreements 
also contributing to the increase in was higher employee compensation costs from merit increases  an additional year of stock compensation amortization and the emergence of higher spending for information technology contracts 
these increases were partially offset by certain costs that did not recur  including expenses associated with convention related initiatives and the write off of medical testing materials 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense increased due to the redundant reserve financing executed in product sales and face amount in force 
we issued  new life insurance policies in compared with  new policies in  primarily as a result of recruiting growth following our convention and the subsequent return to a normalized range of productivity during the changes in the face amount of our in force book of term life insurance policies were as follows year ended december  change dollars in millions face amount in force  beginning of period issued face amount terminations foreign currency face amount in force  end of period not meaningful the total face amount of policies in force increased in reflecting lower terminations on existing policies  partially offset by a decline in the issued face amount of policies 
the primary cause for the decrease in issued face amount during is the impact that the recruiting surge had on new policies issued in the prior year 
the decrease in terminations resulted from higher persistency

commissions and fees 
commissions and fees increased largely due to higher product sales  as well as an increase in average client asset values 
the increase in product sales was driven by higher mutual fund sales and new offerings of fixed indexed annuities  which was partially offset by a decline in variable annuity sales 
higher asset based revenues were primarily the result of the increase in average client asset values  which reflects market conditions combined with an increase in sales mix towards managed accounts products launched in the distribution of managed accounts results in higher ongoing asset based revenues in lieu of upfront sales based revenues 
the increases in total revenues were slightly offset by a recordkeeping fee structure change that resulted in a decrease in account based revenues and other operating expenses 
amortization of dac 
the decrease in the rate of dac amortization was primarily driven by the impact of improved investment returns on our canadian segregated funds products 
sales commissions 
the increase in commissions was primarily driven by the increases in commissions and fees revenue noted above 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses remained comparatively flat year over year as the decrease in expenses from the change in the recordkeeping fee structure discussed above was mostly offset by increased legal fees and expenses  as well as higher employee compensation costs from merit increases and another year of stock compensation amortization 
the increase in legal fees and expenses was primarily due to million of expenses recorded in the fourth quarter of attributable to defending claims alleged by certain participants in the florida retirement system defined benefit plan 
see note commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated and combined financial statements for more information 
product sales 
investment and savings products sales were higher in compared to largely reflecting the introduction of our fixed indexed annuity and managed accounts products and greater sales of retail mutual funds

total revenues 
total revenues decreased during the year ended december  primarily due to lower net investment income from a lower average base of invested assets subsequent to share repurchases throughout the decline also resulted from the termination of our loan business and a decrease in our short term disability product line 
these decreases were partially offset by realized investment gains from the sale of invested assets sold to fund share repurchases during benefits and claims 
benefits and claims were lower primarily due to lower claims experienced on our short term disability product  which is underwritten by nblic  our new york insurance subsidiary 
benefits and claims were also lower compared to the prior year due to the impact of an approximately million charge recorded during to record cumulative potential claims related to cross checking public death records to identify deceased policyholders for whom claims have not been filed and of which we were unaware  which did not repeat in the 
table of contents amortization of dac 
during the year ended december   dac amortization increased approximately primarily associated with refinements in policy estimates for student life products 
insurance expenses 
insurance expenses were lower in in large part due to a charge for our estimated share of the liquidation plan for executive life insurance company of new york  an unaffiliated life insurance company  filed by the nysdfs during sales commissions 
the decrease in sales based commissions was primarily driven by the decline in commissions and fees revenue related to the termination of our loan business 
interest expense 
interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of the senior notes in  which was at higher principal amount versus the repaid citigroup note 
this increase was partially offset by the comparatively lower interest rate on the senior notes 
other operating expenses 
the increase in other operating expenses is largely attributable to higher employee compensation costs from merit increases and an additional year of stock compensation amortization  partially offset by certain prior year charges

total revenues 
total revenues declined in primarily as a result of the april transactions 
excluding approximately million of revenues in that would have been recognized by citigroup had the april transactions been effected on january   total revenues would have increased approximately million  or  compared with pro forma basis this increase primarily reflects incremental premiums on new term policies issued subsequent to the citigroup reinsurance transactions and an increase in commissions and fees  largely driven by increased sales of variable annuities in our investment and savings product segment

excluding approximately million of benefits and expenses in that would have been recognized by citigroup had the april transactions been effected on january   total benefits and expenses would have increased approximately million  or  compared with pro forma basis the increase in total benefits and expenses was primarily a result of the growth in our term life and investment and savings products businesses and higher overall operating expenses  including the build out of incremental functions  processes and expenses associated with becoming a public company 
the increase in benefits and claims and amortization of dac  after giving effect to the april transactions  was largely a result of the continued growth in our term life business following the citigroup reinsurance transactions 
sales commissions were higher consistent with the increase in commission and fee revenue noted in total revenues above 
insurance expenses and other operating expenses increased primarily as a result of initiatives announced at our convention  higher premium taxes  lower expense allowances due to continued run off in the block of business ceded to citigroup and build out of our expenses post ipo 
the decrease in insurance commissions was largely attributable to the discontinuation of certain sales force incentive programs that were replaced with programs that more directly rewarded life policy acquisitions

direct premiums 
direct premiums increased in primarily as a result of growth in new term business and premium increases for policies reaching the end of their initial level premium period 
the growth in direct premiums was consistent with the growth in face amount in force 
ceded premiums 
the increase in ceded premiums primarily reflects the impact of the citigroup reinsurance transactions and the net impact of the ceded premium recoveries discussed in note reinsurance to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
adjusting for approximately million of additional premiums that would have been ceded to citigroup in had the citigroup reinsurance transactions been effected on january   ceded premium would have decreased approximately million  or  reflecting continued run off of the business ceded to citigroup  partially offset by age based increases in yrt reinsurance premiums

these items were partially offset by the release of management incentive compensation accruals for compensation earned in but paid in at a lower rate than had been anticipated

commissions and fees 
commissions and fees increased primarily as a result of economic and market trends and client demand

growth in account values also led to higher dac amortization 
sales commissions 
the increase in sales based commissions was primarily driven by the increases in commissions and fees noted above 
sales based commission expense lagged the growth in sales based commission and fees revenue largely as a result of internal exchanges for variable annuities

notes to the pro forma statement of income unaudited the actual statement of income included income attributable to the underlying policies that were reinsured to citigroup on march  as well as net investment income earned on the invested assets backing the reinsurance balances and the distributions to citigroup made as part of our corporate reorganization 
adjustments for the citigroup reinsurance transactions 
concurrent with the reorganization of our business and prior to completion of the ipo  we formed a new subsidiary  
table of contents prime re  and we made an initial capital contribution to it 
we also entered into a series of coinsurance agreements with prime re and with other citigroup subsidiaries 
under these agreements  we ceded between and of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at december  concurrent with signing these agreements  we transferred the corresponding account balances in respect of the coinsured policies along with the assets to support the statutory liabilities assumed by prime re and the other citigroup subsidiaries 
we believe that three of the citigroup coinsurance agreements  which we refer to as the risk transfer agreements  satisfy us gaap risk transfer rules 
under the risk transfer agreements  we ceded between and of our term life future policy benefit reserves  and we transferred a corresponding amount of invested assets to the citigroup reinsurers 
these transactions did not and will not impact our future policy benefit reserves  and we recorded an asset for the same amount of risk transferred in due from reinsurers 
we also reduced deferred acquisition costs by between and  which will reduce future amortization expenses 
in addition  we will transfer between and of all future premiums and benefits and claims associated with these policies to the corresponding reinsurance entities 
we will receive ongoing ceding allowances as a reduction to insurance expenses to cover policy and claims administration expenses under each of these reinsurance contracts 
one coinsurance agreement  which we refer to as the deposit agreement  relates to a reinsurance transaction that includes an experience refund provision and does not satisfy us gaap risk transfer rules 
we account for this contract under the deposit method 
under deposit method accounting  the amount we pay to the reinsurer will be treated as a deposit and is reported on the balance sheet as an asset in other assets 
the citigroup coinsurance agreements did not generate any deferred gain or loss upon their execution because these transactions were part of a business reorganization among entities under common control 
the net impact of these transactions was reflected as an increase in paid in capital 
prior to the completion of the ipo  we effected a reorganization in which we transferred all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of prime re to citigroup 
each of the assets and liabilities  including the invested assets and the distribution of prime re  was transferred at book value with no gain or loss recorded on our income statement 
for the year ended december   the pro forma statement of income assumes the reinsurance transactions were effected as of january  for policies in force as of year end a reflects premiums ceded to the citigroup reinsurers for the specific policies covered under the risk transfer agreements 
b reflects net investment income on a pro rata share of invested assets transferred to the citigroup reinsurers 
the net investment income was estimated by multiplying the actual investment income by the ratio of the amount of assets transferred to our total portfolio of invested assets 
the amount also includes the change in fair value of the deposit asset related to the reinsurance agreement being accounted for under the deposit method 
c reflects benefits and claims ceded to the citigroup reinsurers for the specific policies covered under the risk transfer agreements 
d reflects the dac amortization ceded to the citigroup reinsurers for the specific policies covered under the risk transfer agreements 
e reflects the non deferred expense allowance received from the citigroup reinsurers under the risk transfer agreements 
f reflects a finance charge payable to the citigroup reinsurer in respect of the deposit agreement 
the annual finance charge is of our excess reserves 
excess reserves are equal to the difference between our required statutory reserves and our economic reserves  which is the amount we determine is necessary to satisfy obligations under our in force policies 
g reflects income tax at the respective period s effective tax rate 
adjustments for the reorganization and other concurrent transactions 
the pro forma statement of income for the year ended december  assumes the reorganization transactions were executed as of january  h reflects a pro rata reduction of net investment income on assets distributed to citigroup as an extraordinary distribution 
i reflects interest expense on a million  interest note payable issued to citigroup 
j reflects expense associated with equity awards granted on april  in connection with the ipo 
the million expense reflects one quarter of vesting related to management awards that continue to vest over three years 
these expenses are reflected in actual results for periods following the ipo

we use a third party investment advisor to manage our investing activities 
our investment advisor reports to our investment committee 
we follow a conservative investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our invested assets and provide adequate liquidity 
in an effort to meet business needs and mitigate risks  our investment guidelines provide restrictions on our portfolio s composition  including limits on asset type  sector limits  credit quality limits  portfolio duration  limits on the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types 
we may also direct our investment managers to invest some of our invested asset portfolio in currencies other than the us dollar 
for example  a portion of our portfolio is invested in assets denominated in canadian dollars  which  at minimum  would equal our reserves for policies denominated in canadian dollars 
additionally  to help ensure adequate liquidity for payment of claims  we take into account the maturity and duration of our invested asset portfolio and our general liability profile 
our invested asset portfolio is subject to a variety of risks  including risks related to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
investment guideline restrictions have been established to minimize the effect of these risks but may not always be effective due to factors beyond our control 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
a significant increase in interest rates could result in significant losses  realized or unrealized  in the value of our invested asset portfolio 
additionally  with respect to some of our investments  we are subject to prepayment and  therefore  reinvestment risk

other significant assets and liabilities 
the balances of and changes in other significant assets and liabilities were as follows december  change dollars in thousands assets due from reinsurers deferred policy acquisition costs  net liabilities future policy benefits due from reinsurers 
due from reinsurers reflects future policy benefit and claim reserves due from third party reinsurers  including the citigroup reinsurers 
such amounts are reported as due from reinsurers rather than offsetting future policy benefits 
the increase in due from reinsurers was largely driven by continued aging of the block of business ceded to citigroup and growth in our new term business 
deferred policy acquisition costs  net 
the increase in dac was primarily a result of incremental commissions and expenses deferred as a result of new business  which was not subject to the citigroup reinsurance agreements 

table of contents future policy benefits 
the increase in future policy benefits was primarily a result of the aging of and growth in our in force book of business

liquidity and capital resources dividends and other payments to us from our subsidiaries are the principal sources of cash for the parent company 
the amount of dividends paid by our subsidiaries is dependent on their capital needs to fund future growth and applicable regulatory restrictions 
the primary uses of funds by the parent company include the payment of general operating expenses  the payment of dividends and the payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt 
at december   the parent company had cash and invested assets of approximately million 
the liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries principally relate to the liabilities associated with their distribution and underwriting of insurance products including the payment of claims  distribution of investment and savings products  operating expenses  income taxes and the payment of dividends 
historically  our insurance subsidiaries have used cash flow from operations associated with our in force book of term life insurance to fund their liquidity requirements 
our insurance subsidiaries principal cash inflows from operating activities are derived from policyholder premiums  ceded claim recoveries and allowances  and investment income earned on invested assets that support our statutory capital and reserves 
we also derive cash inflows from the distribution of investment and savings products and other products 
our principal outflows relate to payments for claims and ceded premiums 
the principal cash inflows from investment activities result from repayments of principal and investment income  while the principal outflows relate to purchases of fixed maturity securities 
we typically hold cash sufficient to fund operating flows  and invest any excess cash 
our distribution and underwriting of term life insurance place significant demands on our liquidity  particularly when we experience growth 
we pay a substantial majority of the sales commission during the first year following the sale of a policy 
our underwriting activities also require significant cash outflows at the inception of a policy s term 
however  we anticipate that cash flows from our businesses  including our existing block of term life policies and our investment and savings products  will continue to provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements over the next months 
we may seek to enhance our liquidity position or capital structure through borrowings from third party sources  sales of debt or equity securities  reserve financings or some combination of these sources 
additionally  we believe that cash flows from our businesses and potential sources of funding  as described above  will sufficiently support the long term liquidity needs of the company 
significant transactions 
in april  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that enables us to offer and sell to the public our equity and debt securities from time to time as we may determine and enables certain of our significant stockholders to resell our shares of common stock held by them 
specific information regarding the terms and securities which may be offered pursuant to this registration statement will be provided at the time of such offering s 
net proceeds of any offering of securities by us pursuant to this registration statement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness or repurchases of shares of our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to this registration statement  citigroup sold an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market in april and december  and warburg pincus sold million shares of our common stock in the open market in november we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock from citigroup during during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock from warburg pincus and approximately million in other transactions 
see notes payable below for information on our debt transactions in the model regulation entitled valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as regulation xxx  requires insurers to carry statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees which are often significantly in excess of the reserves that insurers deem necessary to satisfy claim obligations 
accordingly  many insurance companies have sought ways to reduce their capital needs by financing these excess reserves through bank financing  reinsurance arrangements and other financing transactions 
we completed a regulation xxx redundant reserve financing transaction during  which is described in more detail in off balance sheet arrangements below and note commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
cash flows 
cash flows from operating activities are affected primarily by the timing of premiums received  commissions and fees received  claims paid  commissions paid to sales representatives  administrative and selling expenses  investment income  and cash taxes 
our principal source of cash historically has been premiums received on term life 
table of contents insurance policies in force 
we typically generate positive cash flows from operating activities  as premiums  net investment income  commissions and fees collected from our insurance and investment and savings products exceed benefits  commissions and operating expenses paid  and we invest the excess 
the components of the changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was higher than in primarily due to cash received from the collection of premium revenue in excess of benefits and claims paid in our new term business 
the additional layering of net premiums from our new term business has generated positive incremental cash flows after payments are made for policy acquisition costs during the first year that policies are issued 
proceeds from maturities of trading investments during further contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
the increases in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by funding of the deposit asset related to the reinsurance agreement  the difference in the timing of payments to citigroup for coinsurance activity  and the timing of amounts due from reinsurers 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in as compared to largely due to higher income tax payments and other intercompany settlements paid to citigroup in in connection with the april transactions 
the effect of these items were partially offset by lower net investment income in  primarily as a result of the april transactions 
net cash provided by operating activities for also reflects approximately million of net purchases of trading securities by our broker dealer subsidiary  compared with approximately million of net sales and maturities in investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities in was substantially driven by proceeds from the sale of available for sale investments to fund share repurchases  partially offset by cash paid for acquired investments 
although positive for  net cash provided by investing activities was lower than in primarily due to lower proceeds from sales of investments needed to fund share repurchases during the company primarily used proceeds from sales of investments to fund share repurchases in  while proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes  cash from operations  and sales of investments were used to fund share repurchases in the decline in cash provided by investing activities in compared to primarily reflects the impact of securities sales during the first quarter of as we increased our cash position to fund distributions to citigroup in connection with the april transactions 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities for was modestly higher than in as higher share repurchases and cash dividends paid to shareholders were mostly offset by the net increase in borrowings from the refinancing of our notes payable in july in  the decrease in net cash used in financing activities from was primarily due to the impact of the distributions paid to citigroup in connection with the april transactions as well as the first quarter of payment of the dividend declared to citigroup 
net cash used in financing activities in also reflects the repurchase of our common stock from citigroup in november notes payable 
in april  we issued the million citigroup note as part of our corporate reorganization 
prior to the issuance of the citigroup note  we had no outstanding debt 
in july  we publicly issued the senior notes for million and used a portion of the net cash proceeds to repay the citigroup note in whole at a redemption price equal to of the outstanding principal amount 
we issued the senior notes at a price of of the principal amount with an annual interest rate of  payable semi annually in arrears on january and july the senior notes mature on july  we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior notes at december  no events of default s occurred on the senior notes  or the citigroup note prior to its repayment  during the year ended december  we calculate our debt to capital ratio by dividing total long term debt by the sum of stockholders equity and total long term debt 
as of december   our debt to capital ratio was

the naic has established rbc standards for us life insurers  as well as a risk based capital model act the rbc model act that has been adopted by the insurance regulatory authorities 
the rbc model act requires that life insurers annually submit a report to state regulators regarding their rbc based upon four categories of risk asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the capital requirement for each is determined by applying factors that vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset  premiums and reserve items 
the formula is an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action 
as of december   our us life insurance subsidiaries had statutory capital substantially in excess of the applicable statutory requirements to support existing operations and to fund future growth 
primerica life rbc ratio remained well positioned to support existing operations and fund future growth

table of contents contractual obligations 
our contractual obligations  including payments due by period  were as follows december  total liability total payments less than year years years more than years in millions future policy benefits policy claims and other benefits payable other policyholder funds long term debt principal interest obligations commissions purchase obligations operating lease obligations n a current income tax payable other liabilities total contractual obligations our liability for future policy benefits represents the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid  less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected 
net premiums represent the portion of gross premiums required to provide for all benefits and associated expenses 
these benefit payments are contingent on policyholders continuing to renew their policies and make their premium payments 
our contractual obligations table discloses the impact of benefit payments that will be due assuming the underlying policy renewals and premium payments continue as expected in our actuarial models 
the future policy benefits represented in the table are presented on an undiscounted basis  gross of any amounts recoverable through reinsurance agreements and gross of any premiums to be collected 
we expect to fully fund the obligations for future policy benefits from cash flows from general account invested assets and from future premiums 
these estimations are based on mortality and lapse assumptions comparable with our historical experience 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results 
policy claims and other benefits payable represents claims and benefits currently owed to policyholders 
other policyholders funds primarily represent claim payments left on deposit with us 
long term debt principal relates to the company senior notes  and interest obligations reported within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets represent the expected future interest payments on outstanding debt held by the company and expected future expense payments related to any issued letters of credit under the credit facility agreement as of december  commissions represent gross  undiscounted commissions that we expect to incur  contingent on the policyholders continuing to renew their policies and make their premium payments as noted above 
the total liability amount is reported within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
these obligations consist primarily of accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities  including committed funds related to meetings and conventions for our independent sales force  plus a variety of vendor commitments funding our ongoing business operations 
the total liability amount is reported within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
our operating lease obligations primarily relate to office and warehouse space and office equipment 
in september  we signed an agreement to lease a new build to suit facility which will replace and consolidate substantially all of our existing duluth  georgia based executive and home office operations 
we expect the building to be complete and ready for occupancy in the first half of the initial lease term will be years with estimated minimum annual rental payments ranging from approximately million at inception to approximately million in year the leases covering our existing duluth  georgia based executive and home office operations will terminate in the second quarter of as such  we do not expect a material increase in our operating lease expenditures  however the period over which we are contractually obligated for the executive and home office lease will extend to other liabilities are obligations reported within the consolidated balance sheets and consist primarily of amounts due under reinsurance agreements and general accruals and payables 
the total payments within the table differ from the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets due to the exclusion of amounts where a reasonable estimate of

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of the loss of fair value resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying financial instruments are traded 
sensitivity analysis measures the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market rates or prices on the profitability of market sensitive financial instruments 
the following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates and canadian currency exchange rates is based on shock tests  which model the effects of interest rate and canadian exchange rate shifts on our financial condition and results of operations 
although we believe shock tests provide the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the sec  they are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by their inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
although the following results of shock tests for changes in interest rates and canadian currency exchange rates may have some limited use as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
these disclosures also are selective in nature and address  in the case of interest rates  only the potential direct impact on our financial instruments and  in the case of canadian currency exchange rates  the potential translation impact on net income from our canadian subsidiaries 
they do not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of these changes in interest rates and canadian currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
the fair value of the fixed maturity securities in our invested asset portfolio as of december  was approximately billion 
the primary market risk for this portion of our invested asset portfolio is interest rate risk 
one means of assessing the exposure of our fixed maturity securities portfolios to interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential changes in market value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of basis points across all maturities 
this model is sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve 
under this model  with all other factors constant and assuming no offsetting change in the value of our liabilities  we estimated that such an increase in interest rates would cause the market value of our fixed maturity securities portfolios to decline by approximately million  or approximately  based on our actual securities positions as of december  if interest rates remain at or near historically low levels  we anticipate the average yield of our fixed income investment portfolio  and therefore the investment income derived from it  to decrease as maturing fixed income investments will be replaced with purchases of lower yielding investments 
approximately million of our fixed income investment portfolio with an average book yield of around is scheduled to mature during canadian currency risk 
we also have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk to the extent we conduct business in canada 
for the year ended december   of our revenues from operations  excluding realized investment gains  were generated by our canadian operations 
a strong canadian dollar relative to the us dollar results in higher levels of reported revenues  expenses  net income  assets  liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our us dollar financial statements  and a weaker canadian dollar has the opposite effect 
historically  we have not hedged this exposure  although we may elect to do so in future periods 
one means of assessing exposure to changes in canadian currency exchange rates is to model the effects on reported income using a sensitivity analysis 
we analyzed our canadian currency exposure for the year ended december  net exposure was measured assuming a decrease in canadian currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar 
we estimated that such a decrease would decrease our income before income taxes for the year ended december  by approximately million 
credit risk 
we extensively use reinsurance in the united states to diversify our insurance and underwriting risk and to manage our loss exposure to mortality risk 
reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders 
due to factors such as insolvency  adverse underwriting results or inadequate investment returns  our reinsurers may not be able to pay the amounts they owe us on a timely basis or at all 
further  reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them or might delay payment 
to limit our exposure with any one reinsurer  we monitor the concentration of credit risk we have with our reinsurance counterparties  as well as their financial condition 
we manage this reinsurer credit risk through analysis and monitoring of the credit worthiness of each of our reinsurance partners to minimize collection issues 
also  for reinsurance contracts with unauthorized reinsurers  we require collateral such as letters of credit 
for information on our reinsurance exposure and reinsurers  see note reinsurance to our consolidated and combined financial statements 

table of contents we also bear credit risk on our investment portfolio related to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of an obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest 
in an effort to meet business needs and mitigate credit and other portfolio risks  we established investment guidelines that provide restrictions on our portfolio s composition  including limits on asset type  sector limits  credit quality limits  portfolio duration  limits on the amount of investments in approved countries and permissible security types
