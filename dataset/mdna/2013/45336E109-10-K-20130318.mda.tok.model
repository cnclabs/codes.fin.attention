the md a gives effect to the restatement of prior period consolidated financial statements referred to in note restatement of prior year financial statements to the consolidated financial statements contained in part iv  item overview incontact began in as a reseller of telecommunications services and has evolved to become a leading provider of cloud contact center software solutions 
we help contact centers around the world create effective customer experiences through our powerful portfolio of cloud contact center contact routing  self service and agent optimization software solutions 
our services and software solutions enable contact centers to operate more efficiently  optimize the cost and quality of every customer interaction  create new pathways to profit and ensure ongoing customer centric business improvement and growth 
we began offering cloud solutions to the contact center market in our dynamic technology platform provides our customers a pay as you go solution without the costs and complexities of premise based systems 
our proven cloud delivery model provides compelling total cost of ownership savings over premise based technology by reducing upfront capital expenditures  eliminating the expense of system management and maintenance fees  while providing agility that enables businesses to scale their technology as they grow 
we provide software which includes the following automatic call distributing 
table of contents computer telephony integration interactive voice response with speech recognition outbound dialing pbx and crm integration echo agent service surveys and reports workforce optimization quality monitoring screen recording interactive reporting tool taken together  the incontact cloud platform creates an integrated solution for contact centers  including those with distributed workforces either at home or multi site 
recent developments in  we entered into reseller agreements for our cloud contact center software solutions with siemens and verizon 
the new opportunity required us to invest in the infrastructure to deliver our cloud contact center software solutions to new and larger mid market enterprise and international customers and increase our customer service and support capacity 
we began making these investments in and continued into the investments increased our cost of services and other operating expenses in the second half of and continuing into ahead of the anticipated and guaranteed revenue  which adversely affected our margins and results of operations in these periods 
our ability to recoup that investment depends on how successful our reseller strategy is in and beyond  but we were able to mitigate the risk associated with future realization of sales  in part  by obtaining minimum purchase commitments from siemens 
such commitments  along with other operating efficiencies enabled us to improve our margins and results of operations in we sold million shares of common stock in the open market for net proceeds of million in september proceeds of the offering have been used and will continue to be used to fund our cloud software growth initiatives and development of our infrastructure 
we also plan to use a portion of the proceeds of the offering to pursue strategic acquisitions of intellectual property by direct acquisition of the technology or the company that owns the technology 
during  siemens resold substantially fewer software services than they had originally anticipated 
in february  we amended certain provisions of our reseller agreement with siemens  allowing siemens more time to implement a revised go to market sales plan  with the objective of increasing contract revenue progressively to a level commensurate with the amount of the quarterly minimum purchase commitments 
no assurances can be given that the plan will be fully implemented or be successful 
the revised minimum purchase commitments total million of net software revenue in  million in and up to million in  which may be credited up to million in  in consideration for up to million investment by siemens in sales and marketing of our cloud contact center software solutions 
trends in our business we continue to experience increases in software segment revenue due to our continued focus and investment in software segment sales and marketing through our direct sales initiatives and referral partner arrangements 
we expect software and telecom segment revenue to continue to increase during the telecom segment increase in net growth is attributable to the increase in telecom revenue from our incontact portfolio customers  exceeding lost revenue from attrition of our telecom only customers 
we expect the telecom revenue from our incontact portfolio customers to continue to exceed the attrition of our telecom only customers in 
table of contents there has been an increase in costs of revenue during due to greater professional service and customer service personnel costs as we employ more personnel  including higher paid employees with more developed skill sets to service larger mid market and enterprise customers  greater direct costs attributable to establishing our international infrastructure and international call traffic  and an increase in amortization of previously capitalized internal use software costs 
however  the costs of revenue as a percentage of sales has decreased in as compared to due to the increase in revenue as a result of developing the infrastructure to service more enterprise and international customers  investing in sales and marketing activities  and from the reseller sales channel added during we expect costs of revenue in absolute dollars to continue to increase  but we expect the costs of revenue as a percentage of sales to continue to decrease slightly as we anticipate increases in revenue for the reasons noted previously 
sources of revenue we derive our revenues from two major business activities delivery and support of our incontact portfolio of software solutions and associated professional services and reselling telecommunication services 
our primary business focus is marketing and selling our incontact portfolio 
software software delivery and support of our incontact portfolio is provided on a monthly recurring subscription basis 
monthly recurring charges are billed in arrears and recognized for the period in which they are earned 
in addition to the monthly recurring revenue  revenue is also received on a non recurring basis for professional implementation services or on a recurring basis related to improving a customer s contact center efficiency and effectiveness metrics  as it relates to utilization of the incontact portfolio 
customers access cloud software and data through a secure internet connection 
support services include technical assistance for our software products and product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
our telecommunications and data network is fundamental to our incontact portfolio and allows us to provide the all in one incontact solution 
software service revenue also includes revenue related to minimum purchase commitments through july  from a related party reseller 
telecom we derive revenue from telecommunications services such as dedicated transport  switched long distance and data services 
these services are provided over our network or through third party telecommunications providers 
revenue for transactional long distance usage is derived based on customer specific rate plans and the customer s call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated 
customers are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period 
if the billing period spans more than one month  earned but unbilled revenues are recognized as revenue for incurred usage to date 
costs of revenue and operating expenses costs of revenue costs of revenue consist primarily of payments to third party long distance service providers for resold telecommunication services to our customers 
costs of revenue also include salaries including stock based compensation and related expenses for our software services delivery  support and professional services organizations  equipment depreciation relating to our services  amortization of acquired intangible assets  amortization of capitalized internal use software development costs  and allocated overhead  such as rent  utilities and depreciation on property and equipment 
as a result  overhead expenses are included in costs of revenue and each operating expense category 
the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than the cost associated with delivering our software services due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 
we anticipate that we will incur additional costs for long distance service providers  hosting  support  employee salaries and related expenses  to support delivery of our software solutions in the future 

table of contents selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries including stock based compensation and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing  including commissions and bonuses  advertising  marketing events  corporate communications  expenses  travel costs and allocated overhead 
since our software segment revenue is delivered and therefore recognized over time  we have experienced a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
we believe it is important to continue investing in selling and marketing to create brand awareness and lead generation opportunities  to increase market share and to support the resellers added in accordingly  we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support growth initiatives 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of the non capitalized portion of salary including stock based compensation and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products  enhancement of existing products  quality assurance  market research  testing  product management and allocated overhead 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we intend to release new features and functionality on a frequent basis  expand our content offerings  upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary including stock based compensation and related expenses for management  finance and accounting  legal  information systems and human resources personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we anticipate that we will incur additional employee salaries and related expenses  professional service fees and other corporate expenses related to the growth of our business and operations in the future 
as such  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars

segment reporting we operate under two business segments software and telecom 
the software segment referred to as cloud or saas includes all monthly recurring subscription revenue related to the delivery of our software solutions plus the associated professional services and setup fees  and revenue related to minimum purchase commitments from siemens through july the telecom segment includes all voice and data long distance services provided to customers 
management evaluates segment performance based on operating data revenue  costs of revenue  and other operating expenses 
management does not evaluate and manage segment performance based on assets 
for segment reporting  we classify operating expenses as either direct or indirect 
direct expense refers to costs attributable solely to either selling and marketing efforts or research and development efforts 
indirect expense refers to costs that management considers to be overhead in running the business 
management evaluates expenditures for both selling and marketing and research and development efforts at the segment level without the allocation of overhead expenses  such as rent  utilities and depreciation on property and equipment

table of contents we have a purchase commitment with a national long distance telecommunication provider 
the purchase commitment provides for a monthly minimum of  which can be terminated with a thirty day written notice 
we exceeded our monthly minimums with this carrier in critical accounting estimates revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue is determined and recognized based on the type of service provided for the customer as follows incontact portfolio of services 
revenue is derived from the delivery of any of our software services within the incontact portfolio which are provided on a monthly recurring subscription basis 
because customers do not have the right to take possession of the software  these arrangements are considered service contracts and are not within the scope of industry topic  software 
monthly recurring subscription charges are generally billed in arrears and recognized for the period in which they are earned 
for subscription contracts with multiple elements hosted software  training  installation and long distance services  we follow the guidance provided in accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement 
in addition to the monthly recurring subscription revenue  revenue is also derived on a non recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a customer s incontact portfolio experience 
because our professional services  such as training and installation  are not considered to have standalone value  we defer revenue for upfront fees received for professional services in multiple element arrangements and recognize such fees as revenue over the estimated life of the customer 
professional services sold separately ie not sold contemporaneously with the negotiation of a subscription contract are recognized as revenue over the period that services are provided 
fees for telecommunications services in multiple element arrangements within the incontact portfolio are based on usage and are recognized as revenue in the same manner as fees for telecommunications services discussed in the following paragraph 
also included is revenue related to the quarterly minimum purchase commitments from a related party reseller 
telecommunications services 
revenue is derived from telecommunications services  such as dedicated transport  switched long distance and data services 
these services are provided over our network or through third party telecommunications providers 
our network is the backbone of our incontact portfolio and allows us to provide the all in one incontact solution 
revenue for the telecommunications usage is derived based on customer specific rate plans and the customer s call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated 
customers are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period 
if the billing period spans more than one month  earned but unbilled revenues are recognized as revenue for incurred usage to date 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable is composed of billed amounts as well as unbilled amounts for which revenue has been earned and recognized 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts  an estimate of the amount of accounts receivable outstanding of which management believes may be uncollectible  is determined each month principally based on the aging of receivables 
management reviews the current trends and aged receivables periodically and adjusts the estimated bad debt expense to accrue for doubtful accounts as needed 
an account is written off by management when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts may continue 
long lived assets we estimate the useful lives of long lived assets in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
depreciation and amortization expense is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
long lived assets 
table of contents consist of property and equipment computer equipment  software  furniture and equipment 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows will be less than carrying values 
intangible assets we estimate the useful lives of intangibles  which include acquired customer lists  patents and acquired technology  in order to determine the amount of amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
we use an accelerated method to amortize customer lists acquired after other intangibles are amortized using the straight line method 
we test intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows will be less than carrying values 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product  and or the partial or complete lapse of continuing technology rights protection 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis on september of each year and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable using a two step process 
first  the fair values are estimated using a market based valuation approach utilizing a multiple of revenues 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments  including judgments about relevant revenue multiples of comparable companies 
we have two reporting units identified as our segments  telecom and software 
all of the goodwill of million relates to the software reporting unit 
therefore  only the carrying value of the software reporting unit was evaluated 
if the carrying value of the software reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step is performed  and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
at september   the fair value of the software reporting unit exceeded its carrying value so no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended december  there were no events or circumstances from the date of our assessment through december  that would impact this assessment 
income taxes all income tax amounts reflect the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future income tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred income tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
to date  a valuation allowance has been recorded to eliminate the deferred income tax assets 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment  and it is difficult to predict when  if ever  our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of the deferred tax assets are realizable 
the amounts relating to taxes also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions 
we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions  however  tax audits  changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes 
management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters 
however  to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts  we may be required to adjust our tax amounts resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires measurement of compensation cost for equity based awards ie  stock options  warrants and restricted stock units at fair value on date of grant and recognition of the fair value of compensation for awards expected to vest over the requisite service period 
we utilize the graded vesting method  rather than a straight line method  for recognizing compensation expense as management believes this graded vesting method more closely matches the expense to associated services 
under this method  nearly of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a typical three year 
table of contents vesting term 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
management considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements see part iv  item financial statements note accounting policies for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
due to the short term nature of the cash equivalents  we believe that we are not subject to any material interest rate risk as it relates to interest income 
interest rates on some of our outstanding leases and revolving credit facility are variable so market fluctuations in interest rate may increase our interest expense
