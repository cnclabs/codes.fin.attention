company overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative small molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer and immune mediated diseases 
our mission and goal is to build a viable biopharmaceutical company that designs  develops and commercializes novel therapies intended to improve quality of life  increase duration of life and resolve serious unmet medical healthcare needs  and to identify promising product candidates based on scientific development and administrational expertise  develop our products in a rapid  cost efficient manner and to pursue commercialization and or development partners when and where appropriate 
we exist to make a difference for the better and these are important times to do that 
presently  we have three product candidates in clinical development and several preclinical molecules in lead optimization 
we are committed to high standards of ethics  scientific rigor  and operational efficiency as we move each of these programs toward potential commercialization 
to date  nearly all of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our products  and we have not generated any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we do not anticipate the generation of any product commercial revenue until we receive the necessary regulatory and marketing approvals to launch one of our products 
during the fiscal year ended june   we exited the development stage  as defined in financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  development stage entities with the signing of our first significant collaboration with janssen biotech  inc and its affiliates janssen see note to the consolidated financial statements  from which we received our first significant revenue from principal operations  reflective that we are no longer in the development stage 
in  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation business now celera corporation a subsidiary of quest diagnostics incorporated  including technology and intellectual property relating to drugs that target histone deacetylase hdac enzymes specific and multiple isoforms  a factor viia inhibitor targeting a tumor signaling pathway involved in angiogenesis  tumor growth and metastases and b cell associated tyrosine kinase inhibitors potentially useful for the treatment of lymphomas leukemias  anti inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
since that time we have advanced these programs by bringing several product candidates into clinical development 
we are headquartered in sunnyvale  california and are listed on nasdaq under the symbol pcyc

our pipeline our clinical development and product candidates are small molecule enzyme inhibitors designed to target key biochemical pathways involved in human diseases with critical unmet needs 
we currently have three proprietary drug candidates under clinical development and several preclinical lead molecules 
these include an inhibitor of bruton tyrosine kinase btk ibrutinib pci  hereafter referred to as ibrutinib currently in multiple phase iii studies in hematologic malignancies  a btk inhibitor lead optimization program targeting anti inflammatory and autoimmune indications  an inhibitor of factor viia pci in a phase ii clinical trial in pancreatic cancer and a hdac inhibitor  abexinostat formerly known as pci  currently in phase i and ii clinical trials in solid tumors and hematological malignancies 
our drug development programs btk inhibitor program we are pioneering the development of orally bioavailable inhibitors of btk  a signaling protein that is critically important for the activity of b cells immune cells that can develop into antibody producing cells 
b cell lymphomas and leukemias  which are common blood cancers  result from mutations acquired during b cell development that lead to uncontrolled b cell proliferation 
also  when b cells are overactive  the immune system can produce antibodies that begin to attack the body own tissue  leading to autoimmune diseases 
both autoimmune diseases and b cell malignancies are thought to be driven by overactive signaling and activation of the b cell antigen receptor bcr  a process that is dependent on btk 
we have developed ibrutinib  which has demonstrated clinical activity and tolerability in phase i and phase ii clinical trials in a variety of b cell malignancies  including chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll and a number of non hodgkin lymphoma nhl subtypes 
cll  mantle cell lymphoma mcl  follicular lymphoma fl  diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbcl  multiple myeloma mm and waldenstrom macroglobulinemia wm are specific indications of our current or planned phase ib ii and phase iii development program 
we are currently using a multi tier preclinical testing strategy to optimize inhibitors of btk for anti inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
during the calendar year ended december   we provided updates on several of our clinical programs 
the following is a summary of the clinical updates ibrutinib pci clinical development update in mantle cell lymphoma mcl at the american society of hematology ash annual meeting in december  we presented interim results of our phase ii study in relapse refractory mcl patients 
this presentation showed an overall response rate orr in evaluable mcl patients of  including complete responses crs and partial responses prs  with an estimated median progression free survival pfs of months 
an analysis of a subset of patients presented last year at ash with longer follow up demonstrated an incremental improvement in the response rate over time 
the orr increased in this subset from as reported at ash in to an orr of as reported at ash in  with the cr rate increasing from to over the same period 
the treatment emergent adverse events were consistent with safety data previously reported for ibrutinib monotherapy 
the most common non hematologic events were mild to moderate diarrhea and fatigue 
the most common infections were respiratory 
severe adverse events were uncommon 
ibrutinib pci clinical development update in chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma cll sll updated data of our single agent phase ib ii study in treatment naive and relapsed refractory cll sll patients was also presented at ash a multicenter  open label  single agent phase ib ii study of ibrutinib monotherapy in either relapsed refractory n or years or older treatment naive n years of age or older cll patients completed enrollment in july the study was designed to assess safety  tolerability  and efficacy of ibrutinib at two dose levels  mg and mg daily until progression or intolerability 
the relapse and refractory population contained a high risk subset n  defined by patients who fail to respond or relapse within months of chemoimmunotherapy 
with a maximum follow up of months  it was estimated that of the treatment naive and of the relapsed refractory not including high risk patients and of the relapsed refractory  including high risk  patients were without progression 
responses were independent of high risk genetic features that would predict poor outcome to standard chemotherapy 
continuous dosing was well tolerated with a reported lack of detrimental impact on immunoglobulins or hematologic parameters 
adverse events were predominantly grade or less in severity  with the most common being diarrhea  fatigue  upper respiratory tract infection  rash  nausea and arthralgias joint pain 
the majority of events were managed with over the counter medicines and outpatient care 
grade and grade hematologic events  neutropenia low white cell counts and thrombocytopenia low platelet counts  potentially related to ibrutinib occurred in of patients 
of the treatment naive patients on the trial at the time of the analysis  there was only patient that had discontinued due to disease progression 
additionally at ash  findings were presented from a phase ii  single center trial with high risk cll patients treated with mg day ibrutinib in combination with rituximab  an anti cd monoclonal antibody sponsored by the md anderson cancer center 
the high risk patients had one of the following characteristics  all predictive of poor outcome to standard chemotherapy deletion in chromosome p  mutation in the tumor suppressor gene tp  deletion in chromosome q or relapse less than months after chemo immunotherapy 
the results after a median follow up of months were notable in these difficult to treat patients  with an overall response rate of 
treatment was well tolerated  no new safety signals were noted  with grade adverse events reported that were largely unrelated to ibrutinib or the combination and transient such as neutropenia low white blood cell count  fatigue  insomnia  and bone aches 
the most common grade infection was pneumonia 
we previously reported at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting in june  results of phase ii studies that included ibrutinib also in combination 
the pcyc study included a total of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma prolymphocytic leukemia cll sll pll n and richter transformation n treated with ibrutinib mg was followed by concomitant ofatumumab with continued ibrutinib until progression 
the combination was well tolerated  as indicated by reports that the majority of adverse events were grades no new safety signals were identified 
at the time of the analysis for the cll sll pll patients  the overall response rate  as measured by iwcll criteria  and the progression free survival probability were both at the median follow up of months 
cohorts evaluating other therapeutic sequences with ofatumumab and ibrutinib are currently underway and enrollment has been completed on this study 
at asco in june we also presented the phase ii study pcyc which had enrolled a total of relapsed or refractory cll patients treated with a combination of bendamustine and rituximab br  were considered refractory treatment free interval mo to a purine analog eg fludarabine containing regimen and refractory to bendamustine 
patients received ibrutinib mg in combination with bendamustine rituximab 
the combination therapy was well tolerated and there were no discontinuations due to adverse events 
at the median follow up of months  the orr was  progression free survival probability was 
this study was further updated during the european hematology association annual congress in june of with analysis of a small subset of relapse patients who receive ibrutinib in combination with fludarabine cyclophosphamide rituximab fcr 
at the median follow up of months all three patients had achieved an objective response  with two patients achieving minimal residual disease negative mrd negative complete responses and at the time of analysis all patients remained progression free 
in relapsed refractory cll sll patients we initiated resonate pcyc  which is a randomized  multi center  open label  pivotal phase iii trial of ibrutinib as a monotherapy 
the trial is designed to demonstrate superiority of ibrutinib versus ofatumumab 
the primary endpoint of the study is to demonstrate a clinically significant improvement in progression free survival in relapsed or refractory cll sll patients 
this global study is open and pharmacyclics plans to enroll patients worldwide 
in frontline newly diagnosed elderly cll sll patients we initiated a phase iii trial resonate pcyc 
this trial is a randomized  multicenter  open label study of ibrutinib as a monotherapy versus chlorambucil in patients years or older with treatment na ve cll sll 
the study design is in accord with a special protocol assessment spa 
the study is designed to demonstrate superiority of ibrutinib with the primary endpoint of progression free survival pfs when compared to chlorambucil 
this global study is open and pharmacyclics plans to enroll patients worldwide 
we also initiated the resonate trial pcyc  which is a single arm  multicenter  open label phase ii trial using ibrutinib as a monotherapy in patients who have deletion p and who did not respond to or relapsed after at least one prior treatment with chemoimmunotherapy a high unmet need population 
the primary endpoint of the study will be overall response rate 
the key secondary endpoints will be duration of response and other measures of clinical benefit 
this global study is open and pharmacyclics plans to enroll patients worldwide 
ibrutinib pci clinical development update in other b cell malignancies at the ash annual meeting  pharmacyclics and its investigators gave a multitude of presentations showing research and clinical results of using ibrutinib in a variety of other b cell malignancies 
preliminary results were reported from a multicenter  open label  phase ii study of ibrutinib in relapsed refractory dlbcl patients  which either had the activated b cell abc subtype or the germinal center b cell gcb subtype of dlbcl 
the abc subtype growth and proliferation appears to be more driven by b cell receptor signaling mechanism than the gcb subtype 
the orr in the heavily pre treated population was of patients 
responses were primarily in the abc subtype with of patients responding complete responses and partial responses 
in the gcb patients only patient had a partial response 
this study supports the use of abc dlbcl molecular subtyping as a biomarker for selection of patients for future ibrutinib studies 
the safety profile was consistent with previous studies  with most common grade events gastrointestinal and fatigue  grade or higher adverse events  related and unrelated  reported in of the patients 
at the ash annual meeting  long term results on relapsed refractory evaluable follicular patients dosed with ibrutinib as monotherapy from the phase i study pcyc were presented 
patients were heavily pretreated with a median of prior therapies and had high risk follicular lymphoma international prognostic index scores 
the orr in subjects was with crs and prs 
for those patients with at least tumor response assessment  the media pfs in dose cohorts greater or equal mg kg n was reported at months with an orr 
with patients treated at greater or equal mg kg n the median pfs was reported as months with an orr 
the drug was well tolerated with no apparent cumulative toxicity upon extended dosing in this study 
at the ash annual meeting  we also presented clinical results and biomarker studies on multiple myeloma mm patients accrued in the first cohort where ibrutinib was dosed as a monotherapy at mg 
patients were heavily pretreated  with a median of prior therapies range to 
all patients previously had prior exposure to bortezomib  lenalidomide  and dexamethasone or prednisone and had progressed following stem cell transplant 
a total of of the patients had del p 
signals of biologic and clinical activity were observed 
reductions in paraprotein of at least were reported in patients on ibrutinib monotherapy  and one patient went on to have a confirmed pr following addition of dexamethasone 
as anticipated from pre clinical studies  decreases of several biomarkers of bone metabolism  angiogenesis and chemotaxis were observed following the start of treatment 
the most common treatment related adverse events were grade nausea and diarrhea 
we have expanded the study to explore ibrutinib administration of a dose of mg in combination with dexamethasone and a dose of mg as a single agent and in combination with dexamethasone 
as we obtain further data from these cohorts over the next months  we will assess the clinical outcome of ibrutinib in this patient population 
waldenstrom is a subtype of lymphocytic lymphoma  and is considered an indolent b cell malignancy 
pharmacyclics evaluated long term data of waldenstrom patients from its phase i study pcyc which the company initiated in february the company observed objective responses in of patients 
this early development led to a collaboration with dr 
treon at the dana farber cancer institute in boston 
dr 
treon initiated an investigator sponsored study to further investigate ibrutinib in patients who have relapsed waldenstrom disease 
a preliminary look at the data demonstrated early onset of activity  and it appears that btk is a key driver in the pathophysiology of waldenstrom disease 
ibrutinib pci worldwide collaboration with janssen in december  we entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with janssen biotech inc and its affiliates janssen  one of the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson johnson  for the development and commercialization of ibrutinib  a novel  orally active  first in class btk inhibitor being developed for the treatment of hematological malignancies  including non hodgkin lymphoma  chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma 
pharmacyclics and janssen will collaborate on the development of ibrutinib for oncology and other indications  excluding all immune mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions 
each company will lead development for specific indications as stipulated in a global development plan 
the agreement includes plans to launch multiple phase iii trials of ibrutinib over the next several years 
following regulatory approval  both pharmacyclics and janssen will book revenue and co commercialize ibrutinib 
in the us  pharmacyclics will book sales and take a lead role in us commercial strategy development and both pharmacyclics and janssen will share in commercialization activities 
outside the united states  janssen will book sales and lead and perform commercialization activities 
profits and losses from the commercialization activities will be equally split on a worldwide basis 
development and commercialization activities under the collaboration will be managed through a shared governance structure 
as of december   our partner janssen has initiated  amongst others  the following studies a randomized  multi center phase iii  double blinded  placebo controlled  registration trial of ibrutinib in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in relapsed refractory cll sll patients who received at least one line of prior systemic therapy 
the primary endpoint of the study is to demonstrate a clinically significant improvement in progression free survival when compared to bendamustine and rituximab 
the key secondary endpoints include overall response rate  overall survival and other measures of clinical benefit 
this global study  conducted by janssen  is open and janssen plans to enroll patients worldwide 
a phase ii study of ibrutinib in patients with mantle cell lymphoma who progress after bortezomib therapy a single arm  multi center phase ii trial of ibrutinib as a monotherapy in relapsed refractory mcl patients who received at least one prior rituximab containing chemotherapy regimen and who progressed after bortezomib therapy 
the primary endpoint of the study is overall response rate 
the key secondary endpoints include duration of response  progression free survival rate  and other measures of clinical benefit 
this global study  conducted by janssen  is open and janssen plans to enroll patients worldwide 
a randomized  phase iii study of ibrutinib versus temsirolimus in patients with relapsed or refractory mcl who have received one prior therapy a randomized  multi center phase iii registration trial of ibrutinib as a monotherapy in relapsed refractory mcl patients who received at least one prior rituximab containing chemotherapy regimen 
the primary endpoint of the study is progression free survival when compared to temsirolimus 
the key secondary endpoints include overall response rate  overall survival rate and other measures of clinical benefit 
this global study  conducted by janssen outside the us  is open and janssen plans to enroll patients 
an open label phase ib ii dose escalating study of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab cytoxan adriamycin vincristine prednisone r chop in patients with newly diagnosed cd positive non hodgkin lymphoma the purpose of this study is to identify a safe and tolerable dose of ibrutinib in combination with r chop  once a safe dose is established the study will expand and report responses of this combination in patients with newly diagnosed dlbcl 
this global  multi center study  conducted by janssen  is open and janssen plans to enroll up to patients 
factor viia inhibitor program tissue factor tf up regulation is associated with increased tumor invasiveness and progression  worsened prognosis and increased thromboembolism vte 
factor vii is an enzyme that becomes activated fviia by binding to the cell surface protein tissue factor tf  a protein found in the body that helps to trigger the process of blood clotting in response to injury 
tf is over expressed in many cancers including gastric  breast  colon  lung  prostate  ovarian and pancreatic cancers 
activation of protease activated receptors by tf fviia complex leads to increases in il  vegf and other invasiveness promoting factors 
pci factor viia inhibitor our factor viia inhibitor pci is a novel first in human small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets fviia 
as an inhibitor of fviia  pci has two potential mechanisms of action inhibition of intracellular signaling involved in tumor growth and metastases and inhibition of early coagulation processes associated with thromboembolism 
pci reduced pancreatic adenocarcinoma paca xenograft growth in mice at doses producing x change in prothrombin time 
pci factor viia clinical development update a multicenter phase i ii of pci in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that are either receiving or are planned to receive gemcitabine therapy has completed enrollment 
the phase ii portion of the study randomized patients to receive either gemcitabine alone or gemcitabine plus pci mg kg twice daily 
the objectives are to assess the safety of fviia inhibitor pci at pharmacologically active dose levels  to assess potential inhibition of tumor progression and to obtain initial information of the effects on the incidence of thromboembolic events 
data from initial efficacy analysis is expected to be reported at a scientific event during due to a paradigm shift away from the use of gemcitabine alone for the treatment of pancreatic cancer  enrolling patients in this randomized study has been challenging 
pcyc is evaluating other alternatives for development of this agent 
histone deacetylase inhibitor program histone deacetylases hdacs are well validated drug targets in a number of disease areas including cancer 
these enzymes control several vital cellular processes  such as transcription  cell cycle progression  protein transport and degradation etc  and their activity is often dysregulated in cancer 
classically  the major function of these enzymes is controlling the expression of genes  ie whether genes are turned on or off via epigenetic mechanisms 
in cancer  hdacs are often differentially expressed from normal cells  resulting in gene expression changes that favor a tumor ability to multiply  to avoid apoptosis ie programmed cell death or to become resistant to chemotherapy 
treatment with hdac inhibitors reverses these changes  resulting in cancer cell death in vitro ie in cultured cells and tumor growth inhibition in vivo ie in animals at non toxic concentrations 
abexinostat pci pan hdac inhibitor abexinostat is an orally dosed  broad spectrum  hydroxamic acid based small molecule hdac inhibitor that is under evaluation in phase i and ii clinical trials for refractory solid tumors and lymphoma by pharmacyclics and its ex us partner  les laboratoires servier of paris  france servier 
abexinostat has shown promising anti tumor activity in vitro and in vivo buggy et al  mol cancer ther  
abexinostat pci clinical development update abexinostat has been tested in several clinical trials in the us by pharmacyclics and globally by our partner servier 
in the us  pharmacyclics has completed two phase i studies using abexinostat as a single agent in patients with advanced solid tumors  a phase i ii trial testing abexinostat single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory nhl and a phase i trial in soft tissue sarcoma patients in combination with doxorubicin  an anti tumor agent co sponsored by the massachusetts general hospital and dana farber cancer institute 
the results from the phase ii portion of the single agent nhl trial were presented recently in an oral presentation at ash annual meeting in atlanta 
in this trial  patients in multiply relapsed follicular lymphoma and patients in relapsed mantle cell lymphoma were enrolled 
of the evaluable patients in the follicular arm  one cr and prs were recorded for an orr of 
of the patients had reductions in tumor burden with patients achieving reduction in tumor size 
the responses were durable  with of the follicular patients on study months and patients for months 
the median duration of response was months and the median progression free survival has not yet been reached 
in the mantle cell arm  prs were seen for an orr of 
the overall response rate across both arms was 
abexinostat was well tolerated  with a safety profile consistent with this class of agents  grade or greater cytopenia primarily platelets reported 
the results from the sarcoma trial were presented at the annual meeting of the connective tissue oncology society in november in prague  czech republic 
in this trial  the phase i dose escalation has been completed with patients enrolled 
in the patients evaluable for radiological response  pr and sd were noted 
the clinical benefit was durable with seven patients completing or more cycles and completing cycles each cycle is days 
the toxicities for the combination were manageable and consistent for these agents  and the maximum tolerated dose in combination with doxorubicin was established 
a phase i dose escalation investigator sponsored trial of abexinostat in combination with the multi targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib has been initiated at the university of california  san francisco 
our collaboration partner for ex us markets  servier  has initiated nine phase i ii trials in europe and asia in lymphomas and solid tumors with abexinostat as single agent and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin  liposomal doxorubicin and folfox 
data on single agent abexinostat in nhl was presented as a poster at ash 
further analysis of these trials and any updates may be released by servier 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and clinical trial accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may adversely affect the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue under our license and collaboration arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
determinations of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for deliverables and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for any new or modified transactions  revenue recognized could be adversely affected 
our collaborations prior to july  with multiple elements were evaluated and divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria were met  including whether the delivered element had stand alone value and whether there was verifiable objective and reliable evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we received was combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting when criteria for separation were not met 
amounts received under such arrangements consisted of up front collaboration payments  periodic milestone payments and payments for research activities 
up front payments under agreements that included future performance requirements were recorded as deferred revenue and were recognized over the performance period 
the performance period was estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is reevaluated at each reporting period 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized 
revenue related to substantive  at risk collaboration milestones are recognized upon achievement of the event specified in the underlying agreement 
revenue for research activities are recognized as the related research efforts are performed 
we recognize revenue related to collaboration and license arrangements in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  or asc topic additionally  we adopted  effective july   accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which amended asc topic and provided guidance on how deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting  required an entity to determine the selling price of a separate deliverable using a hierarchy of i vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  ii third party evidence  or tpe  or iii best estimate of selling price  or besp  and required the allocation of the arrangement consideration  at the inception of the arrangement  to the separate units of accounting based on relative fair value 
we evaluate all deliverables within an arrangement to determine whether or not they provide value on a stand alone basis 
based on this evaluation  the deliverables are separated into units of accounting 
the arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based their relative selling prices 
we may exercise significant judgment in determining whether a deliverable is a separate unit of accounting  as well as in estimating the selling prices of such unit of accounting 
to determine the selling price of a separate deliverable  we use the hierarchy as prescribed in asc topic based on vsoe  tpe or besp 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
tpe is determined based on third party evidence for a similar deliverable when sold separately and besp is the price at which we would transact a sale if the elements of collaboration and license arrangements were sold on a stand alone basis 
we may not be able to establish vsoe or tpe for the deliverables within collaboration and license arrangements  as we do not have a history of entering into such arrangements or selling the individual deliverables within such arrangements separately 
in addition  there may be significant differentiation in these arrangements  which indicates that comparable third party pricing may not be available 
we may determine that the selling price for the deliverables within collaboration and license arrangements should be determined using besp 
the process for determining besp involves significant judgment on our part and includes consideration of multiple factors such as estimated direct expenses and other costs  and available data 
for collaborations entered into after july   we have determined besp for license units of accounting based on market conditions  similar arrangements entered into by third parties and entity specific factors such as the terms of previous collaborative agreements  our pricing practices and pricing objectives  the likelihood that clinical trials will be successful  the likelihood that regulatory approval will be received and that the products will become commercialized 
we have also determined besp for services related deliverables based on the nature of the services to be performed and estimates of the associated effort as well as estimated market rates for similar services 
for each unit of accounting identified within an arrangement  we determine the period over which the performance obligation occurs 
revenue is then recognized using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method when the level of effort to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement can be reasonably estimated 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measurement of performance 
effective july   we adopted asu no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition  or asu  which provides guidance on revenue recognition using the milestone method 
under the milestone method  a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
the determination that a milestone is substantive is subject to considerable judgment 
research and development research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and amortized over the period that the goods are delivered or the related services are performed  subject to an assessment of recoverability 
clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flow 
we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we determine our estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
we have purchased quantities of drug substances that are expected to be used in the future to support our clinical development 
until the commercial viability of such products has been demonstrated and the necessary regulatory approvals received  we will continue to charge all such amounts to research and development expense 
share based compensation share based compensation cost for employee stock options is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
the accounting grant date for employee stock options with performance obligations is the date on which the performance goals have been defined and a mutual understanding of the terms has been reached 
generally options with performance obligations vest over a four year period  with the goals set and agreed upon annually 
share based compensation for non employee stock options is re estimated at each period end through the vesting date 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock 
the expected term of stock options granted represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding 
we generally do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior among our employee or non employee population 
as such  for the majority of stock options granted and our employee stock purchase plan  we generally calculate and apply an overall expected term assumption based on historical data 
in certain cases  we use a shorter expected term for performance based stock options based on a combination of historical data and management estimates of the period of time that options will be outstanding 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the our options 
options vest upon the passage of time or a combination of time and the achievement of certain performance obligations 
the compensation committee of the board of directors will determine if the performance conditions have been met 
share based compensation expense for the options with performance obligations is recorded when the company believes that the vesting of these options is probable 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provisions for income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we recognize a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
we apply the provisions of fasb guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we assess all material positions taken in any income tax return  including all significant uncertain positions  in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities 
assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position s sustainability and the tax benefit to be recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of each balance sheet date  unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed  and we will determine whether i the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and ii the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment 
judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available

total revenue increased  for the six months ended december  compared to the six months ended december  primarily due to a  increase in milestone revenue due to our achievement of three development milestones under our collaboration and license agreement with janssen and  of license revenue recognized under our license agreement with novo nordisk a s during the during the six months ended december  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in license revenue due to the recognition of  of license revenue for the upfront payment under the janssen agreement in the prior year and a  decrease in collaboration services revenue recognized under our collaboration and license agreement with servier 
total revenue recognized under the collaboration and license agreement with janssen was  for the six months ended december  compared to  for the six months ended december  the increase in revenue recognized under the janssen agreement for the six months ended december  was primarily due to a  increase in milestone revenue due to our achievement of three development milestones during the period  partially offset by a  decrease in license revenue due to the recognition of  of the non refundable upfront payment that was allocated to license revenue in the prior year period

the increase in accounts receivable was attributed to an increase in amounts owed to us by janssen under the collaboration agreement 
the net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to increased costs related to our clinical trials activities and higher accrued payroll due to increased headcount 
the decrease in deferred revenue was due to the recognition of collaboration services revenue primarily related to the janssen agreement 
the increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to the increase in pre tax income for the period 
net cash provided by operating activities was  during the six months ended december   an increase of  from the  cash used in operating operating activities during the six months ended december  the increase resulted primarily from net income of  as compared to the net loss of  from the six months ended december   after adjusting for an increase of  in stock compensation expense  and the increases in accounts receivables of   in income taxes payable and  in deferred revenue in the period  primarily related to the janssen agreement

in december  we received a  upfront payment from our collaboration and license agreement with janssen 
the collaboration and license agreement provided us with the potential to receive future milestone payments of up to  we received  from janssen related to development milestones during the six months ended december  due to our achievement of three development milestones 
we may receive up to an additional  in development and regulatory milestone payments  for total potential upfront and milestone payments of  however  clinical development entails risks and we have no assurance as to whether or when the milestone targets might be achieved see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during the six months ended december   we entered into a license agreement novo agreement with novo nordisk a s see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the novo agreement  novo nordisk acquired the exclusive worldwide rights for our small molecule factor viia inhibitor  pci  in a restricted disease indication outside of oncology 
novo nordisk will utilize pci as an excipient in a product within novo nordisk biopharmaceutical unit 
novo nordisk is solely responsible for all further research and development activities within the restricted disease indication outside of oncology 
in connection with entering into the novo agreement  we received an upfront payment of  in october the  upfront payment was for the license delivered by us to novo nordisk and we have no additional obligation related to the delivery of the license 
accordingly  we recognized the  upfront payment as license revenue during the six months ended december  in addition to the upfront payment received  we may receive up to  based on the achievement of certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
upon commercialization  we will also receive low single digit tiered royalties on novo nordisk net sales of biopharmaceutical formulations utilizing the addition of pci in april  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation business now celera corporation a subsidiary of quest diagnostics incorporated 
future milestone payments under the agreement  as amended  could total as much as approximately  although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved 
approximately two thirds of the milestone payments relate to our hdac inhibitor program and approximately one third relates to our factor viia inhibitor program 
approximately of the potential future milestone payments would be paid to celera after obtaining regulatory approval in various countries 
there were no milestone payments triggered either during the six months ended december  or for the years ended june   and related to our hdac inhibitor or factor viia programs 
in addition to the milestone payments  celera will be entitled to single digit royalty payments based on annual sales of drugs commercialized from our hdac inhibitor  factor viia inhibitor and certain btk inhibitor programs including ibrutinib 
for any btk inhibitor product or factor viia inhibitor product obtained from celera  the agreement with celera expires on a product by product and country by country basis 
the term of the agreement for a given btk inhibitor product shall expire in a given country upon the expiration of the last to expire celera patent assigned to us that covers the manufacture  use  sale  offer for sale  or importation of such product in such country 
for any hdac inhibitor product obtained from celera  the agreement with celera expires on a product by product and country by country basis 
the term of the agreement for a given hdac inhibitor product shall expire in a given country upon the expiration of the last to expire celera patent assigned to us that covers the sale of such product in such country 
we may terminate the agreement with celera in its entirety  or with respect to one or more of the three classes of products btk inhibitor products  hdac inhibitor products and factor viia inhibitor products obtained from celera  at any time by giving celera at least days prior written notice 
if we terminate the agreement with respect to a particular class of products  ownership of the celera intellectual property assigned to us relating to the products in the terminated product class will revert to celera 
if we terminate the agreement in its entirety  ownership of all of the celera intellectual property assigned to us will revert to celera 
the agreement with celera may be terminated effective immediately upon a party written notice to the other party for a breach by the other party that remains uncured for days after notice of the breach is given to the breaching party 
if we breach the agreement only with respect to one or two of the three classes of products obtained from celera  but not with respect to all three classes of products  and if our breach remains uncured for days after we have received notice of breach from celera  celera may terminate the agreement solely with respect to the class or classes of products affected by our breach  but may not terminate the agreement with respect to the class or classes of products unaffected by our breach 
based upon the current status of our product development plans and our collaboration with janssen  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
we expect research and development expenses  as a result of on going and future clinical trials  to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
due to our extensive drug programs we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we may raise additional funds through the public or private sale of securities  bank debt  partnership collaboration or otherwise 
if we are unable to secure additional funds  whether through sale of our securities  debt or partnership collaborations  we will have to delay  reduce the scope of or discontinue one or more of our product development programs 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approval  continued progress of our research and development programs  our ability to maintain and establish collaborative arrangements with third parties  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the amount and timing of capital equipment purchases  and competing technological and market developments 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be highly dilutive  or otherwise disadvantageous  to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms  would require us to reduce our operating expenses and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements to develop our product candidates and to continue operations  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our primary non cancelable contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter operating lease obligations purchase commitments total purchase commitments primarily consist of non cancelable orders to purchase drug manufacturing equipment and estimated contract termination costs 
in october  we entered into an agreement to lease an additional  square feet of office space in a property adjacent to our existing corporate offices in sunnyvale  california under an operating lease that expires in february the lease agreement entered into in october includes an option to extend the term for an additional years 
our collaboration and license agreement with janssen includes a cost sharing arrangement for certain development activities 
except in certain cases  in general janssen is responsible for approximately of collaboration costs and we are responsible for the remaining of collaboration costs see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the collaboration and license agreement with janssen provides us with a  annual cap of our share of collaboration costs and pre tax losses for each calendar year until the third profitable calendar quarter for the product  as determined in the agreement and any amounts in excess of the annual cap excess amounts are funded by janssen 
janssen may recoup the excess amounts  together with interest from our share of pre tax profits if any in calendar quarters subsequent to our third profitable calendar quarter until the excess amounts and applicable interest has been fully repaid see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   total excess amounts associated with the janssen agreement were  our potential future commitments under the janssen collaboration and license agreement  including excess amounts  are excluded from the above table because we cannot reasonably predict the amount and timing of such payments to janssen as the payments are contingent upon future events 
in addition  we have entered into various agreements and purchase orders related to our clinical trials and general operations which have been excluded from the above table because they are cancellable prior to the date of delivery 
in april  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation business now celera corporation a subsidiary of quest diagnostics incorporated 
future milestone payments under the agreement  as amended  could total as much as approximately  although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved 
approximately two thirds of the milestone payments relate to our hdac inhibitor program and approximately one third relates to our factor viia inhibitor program 
approximately of the potential future milestone payments would be paid to celera after obtaining regulatory approval in various countries 
there were no milestone payments triggered either during the six months ended december  or for the years ended june   and related to our hdac inhibitor or factor viia inhibitor programs 
in addition to the milestone payments  celera will be entitled to single digit royalty payments based on annual sales of drugs commercialized from our hdac inhibitor  factor viia inhibitor and certain btk inhibitor programs including ibrutinib

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we generally maintain investments at an average maturity of less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of december  and  would have potentially declined by approximately  and  respectively 
the table below presents the fair value of our marketable securities at december  and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except interest rates matures in fiscal year marketable securities weighted average interest rate foreign currency risk all of our revenues and the majority of our expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date 
we conduct some transactions in foreign currencies  primarily related to ex us clinical trial activities  and we expect to continue to do so 
we have not entered into any agreements or transactions to hedge the risk associated with potential fluctuations in currencies  accordingly  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk related to these ex us clinical trial activities 
while we may enter into hedge or other agreements in the future to actively manage this risk  we do not believe this risk is material to our financial statements
