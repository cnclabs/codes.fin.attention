the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense over the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income 
excludes assets covered by fdic shared loss agreements

critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within the statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when either earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  the company uses historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in its loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that the company uses 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact its transactions could change 
the following is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses on non covered loans the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 

table of contents the allowance is an amount that management believes is appropriate to absorb estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans  as well as probable credit losses inherent in the balance of the loan portfolio  based on an evaluation of the collectability of existing loans and prior loss experience 
this quarterly evaluation also takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
this evaluation does not include the effects of expected losses on specific loans or groups of loans that are related to future events or expected changes in economic conditions 
while management uses the best information available to make its evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses and may require the bank to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
the allowance consists of specific  and general components 
for loans that are also classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  management believes that it is more likely than not that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  availability of current financial information  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the bank does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures 
accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer fasb asc  receivables requires acquired loans to be recorded at fair value and prohibits carrying over valuation allowances in the initial accounting for acquired impaired loans 
loans carried at fair value  mortgage loans held for sale  and loans to borrowers in good standing under revolving credit arrangements are excluded from the scope of fasb asc which limits the yield that may be accreted to the excess of the undiscounted expected cash flows over the investor s initial investment in the loan 
the excess of the contractual cash flows over expected cash flows may not be recognized as an adjustment of yield 
subsequent increases in cash flows to be collected are recognized prospectively through an adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life 
decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairments through allowance for loan losses 
the company s acquired loans from the sfsb acquisition the covered loans  subject to fasb asc topic  business combinations formerly sfas r  are recorded at fair value and no separate valuation allowance was recorded at the date of acquisition 
fasb asc  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality formerly sop  applies to loans acquired in a transfer with evidence of deterioration of credit quality for which it is probable  at acquisition  that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable 
the company is applying the provisions of fasb asc to all loans acquired in the sfsb acquisition 
the company has grouped loans together based on common risk characteristics including product type  delinquency status and loan documentation requirements among others 
the covered loans acquired are subject to credit review standards described above for non covered loans 
if and when credit deterioration occurs subsequent to the acquisition date  a provision for credit loss for covered loans will be charged to earnings for the full amount without regard to the shared loss agreements 
the company has made an estimate of the total cash flows it expects to collect from each pool of loans  which includes undiscounted expected principal and interest 
the excess of that amount over the fair value of the pool is referred to as accretable yield 
accretable yield is recognized as interest income on a constant yield basis over the life of the pool 
the company also determines each pool s contractual principal and contractual interest payments 
the excess of that amount over the total cash flows it expects to collect from the pool is referred to as nonaccretable difference  which is not accreted into income 
judgmental prepayment assumptions are applied to both contractually required payments and cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition 
over the life of the loan or pool  the company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected 
subsequent decreases in cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the pool are recognized as an impairment in the current period through allowance for loan loss 
subsequent increases in expected or actual cash flows are first used to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or pool 
any remaining increase in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized as an adjustment to the accretable yield with the amount of periodic accretion adjusted over the remaining life of the pool 

table of contents fdic indemnification asset the company is accounting for the shared loss agreements as an indemnification asset pursuant to the guidance in fasb asc  business combinations 
the fdic indemnification asset is required to be measured in the same manner as the asset or liability to which it relates 
the fdic indemnification asset is measured separately from the covered loans and other real estate owned assets oreo because it is not contractually embedded in the covered loan and oreo assets  and is not transferable should the company choose to dispose of them 
fair value was estimated using projected cash flows available for loss sharing based on the credit adjustments estimated for each loan pool and other real estate owned and the loss sharing percentages outlined in the shared loss agreements 
these cash flows were discounted to reflect the uncertainty of the timing and receipt of the loss sharing reimbursement from the fdic 
because the acquired loans are subject to shared loss agreements and a corresponding indemnification asset exists to represent the value of expected payments from the fdic  increases and decreases in loan accretable yield due to changing loss expectations will also have an impact to the valuation of the fdic indemnification asset 
improvement in loss expectations will typically increase loan accretable yield and decrease the value of the fdic indemnification asset  and in some instances  result in an amortizable premium on the fdic indemnification asset 
increases in loss expectations will typically be recognized as impairment in the current period through allowance for loan losses  resulting in additional noninterest income for the amount of the increase in the fdic indemnification asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company is accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and others 
fasb asc discontinues any amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but requires an impairment review at least annually or more often if certain conditions exist 
goodwill impairment charges of million were realized in all of the company s goodwill has been impaired and the carrying value at december  was additionally  under fasb asc  acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles are separately recognized if the benefit of the assets can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their useful lives the costs of purchased deposit relationships and other intangible assets  based on independent valuation by a qualified third party  are being amortized over their estimated lives 
core deposit intangible amortization expense charged to operations was million for each of the years ended december   and the core deposit intangible is evaluated for impairment in accordance with fasb asc income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability or balance sheet method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws 
when tax returns are filed  it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained 
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which  based on all available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes  if any 
tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination 
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are classified as additional income taxes in the statement of income 
under fasb asc  income taxes  a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in management s opinion  based on a three year taxable income projection  tax strategies which would result in potential securities gains and the effects of off setting deferred tax liabilities  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable 
included in deferred tax assets are the tax benefits derived from net operating loss carryforwards totaling million 
management expects to utilize all of these carryforward amounts prior to expiration 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to u 
s 
federal income tax as well as various state income taxes 
years through are open to examination by the respective tax authorities 
table of contents other real estate owned real estate acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure is held for sale and is initially recorded at the fair value at the date of foreclosure net of estimated selling costs  establishing a new cost basis 
subsequent to foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell 
revenues and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in other operating expenses 
costs to bring a property to salable condition are capitalized up to the fair value of the property while costs to maintain a property in salable condition are expensed as incurred 
the company had million and million in other real estate  non covered at december  and  respectively  and million and million in other real estate  covered at december  and  respectively 
overview at december   the company had total assets of billion  an increase of million  or  from total assets of billion at december  total loans were million at december   increasing million  or  from million at december  the carrying value of fdic covered loans declined million  or  from december  and was million at december  non covered loans equaled million at december   increasing million  or  since december  commercial loans secured by real estate represented the largest component  increasing million  or 
mulitfamily loans increased million and residential family loans increased million 
these increases were partially offset by declines in construction and land development loans of million  or 
the company s securities portfolio  including equity securities  increased million  or  during the year ended december   to million  with realized gains of million  through sales activity 
these gains were taken during the year in a portfolio repositioning strategy to mitigate interest rate risk in a higher rate environment 
in a higher rate environment  the liquidity of fixed rate securities is compromised and interest rate risk increases 
the company has shifted from mortgage backed securities balances to floating rate securities issued by the small business administration sba and high quality state  county and municipalities 
additionally  the company took a short term position in a million us treasury issue at december  to fully invest excess cash and due balances 
the company is required to account for the effect of market changes in the value of securities available for sale afs under fasb asc  investments debt and equity securities 
the market value of the december  and december  afs portfolio was million and million  respectively 
the company had a net unrealized gain in the afs portfolio of million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest bearing deposits at december  were million  an increase of million from december  time deposits  and over increased million during the year ended december  as management obtained million in low cost brokered and municipal certificates 
low cost now accounts increased million  or  during savings deposits increased million during the year ended december  time deposits less than  decreased million during as the availability of low cost funds  and over allowed management to lower rates on retail certificates 
mmda accounts declined million during the year ended december  and were million 
the company had fhlb advances of million at december  and million at december  during the third quarter of  the company obtained an additional million in fhlb advances  as well as rolling over million in maturing advances at much lower rates than was being carried prior to their maturities during the quarter 
the company anticipates that the repricing on the million will result in approximately  in after tax savings and that net after tax savings on total fhlb borrowings will be approximately  stockholders equity was million at december  and million at december  the equity to asset ratio was at december  and at december  
table of contents results of operations net income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   net income increased million  or  from net income of million in to net income of million in net income available to common stockholders was million  or per common share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  compared with net income available to common stockholders of  or per common share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  the increase of million in net income available to common stockholders was driven by a decrease in noninterest expense of million  or  a decrease in noninterest income of  or  and a reduction in provision for loan losses of  or 
this increase was offset by an increase in income tax expense of million 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   net income increased million  or  from net loss of million in to net income of million in net income available to common stockholders was  or per common share on a diluted basis for the year ended december   compared with a net loss available to common stockholders of million  or per common share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  the improvement in net income for compared with was driven by a reduction of million in provision for loan losses and a reduction of million in impairment of goodwill charges 
all then remaining goodwill balances were fully written off in net income was additionally aided in  compared with  through expense reductions of million  excluding impairment of goodwill 
net interest income the company s operating results depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  including securities and loans  and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as a volume change 
it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing deposits and other borrowed funds  referred to as a rate change 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this represents an increase in net interest income for of  a decline of million in the yield on earning assets was virtually offset by a decline of million in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  which resulted in the increase of in net interest income 
the tax equivalent net interest margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this was driven by a decrease in interest spread from in to in interest spread is the product of yield on earning assets less cost of total interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of decreases of million  or  in the average balances of interest bearing liabilities coupled with lower rates  which reduced interest expense  from million in to million in the tax equivalent net interest margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest and fees on non covered loans increased million  or  to million during interest and fee income on covered loans equaled million during cost of interest bearing liabilities during totaled million  of which interest on deposits was million 
this compares with million in total interest expense and million in interest on deposits  respectively  in interest and fees on non covered loans decreased million  or  to aggregate million during interest and fee income on covered loans equaled million during cost of interest bearing liabilities during totaled million  of which interest on deposits was million 
this compares with million in total interest expense and million in interest on deposits  respectively  in the company s total loan to deposit ratio was at december  versus at december  the ratio remained fairly constant during the year as management was successful in generating new loan growth in the later part of this was offset by a decline of million in the self liquidating covered loan portfolio 
deposit balances also grew million in  which downwardly affected the total loan to deposit ratio 
the company s total loan to deposit ratio was at december  versus at december  the ratio remained fairly constant during the year as management was successful in generating new loan growth in the later part of that offset a decline of million in the self liquidating covered loan portfolio

provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management of the company based on such factors as historical credit loss experience  industry diversification of the commercial loan portfolio  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral  the volume growth and composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay and the value of collateral  the evaluation of the loan portfolio through the internal loan review function and other relevant factors 
see allowance for loan losses on non covered lloans in the critical accounting policies section above for further discussion 
loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when appropriate 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provision for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations 
management also actively monitors its covered loan portfolio for impairment and necessary loan loss provisions 
provisions for covered loans may be necessary due to a change in expected cash flows or an increase in expected losses within a pool of loans 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses on non covered loans was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses on covered loans was a  credit for the year ended december   which was the result of improvement in expected losses on the company s fdic covered portfolio  which the company recognized in the first quarter of the year 
there was no provision for the covered loan portfolio for the year ended december  in  a number of factors influenced credit risk management practices  including the economy  the rising level of nonperforming assets  deterioration within the company s loan portfolio and regulatory concerns 
as a result  the company took provisions for loan losses totaling million in in  improved credit risk management  which resulted in a lower level of nonperforming assets  influenced the assessment the company makes concerning the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and the need for a provision 
in  the company had provision for loan losses of million 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses was of non covered nonaccrual loans at december   compared with of non covered nonaccrual loans at december  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non covered loans was at december   compared with at december  net charged off loans were million in  compared with million in for the year ended december   a provision for loan losses on the covered loan portfolio of  established an allowance for covered loan losses of the same amount 
this provision was due solely to timing differences in expected cash flows  and not an increase in expected losses 
this provision occurred in the second quarter of and was in accordance with fasb asc the allowance for covered loans was  at december   and  at december  while the maryland loan portfolio contains significant risk  it was considered in determining the initial fair value  which was reflected in adjustments recorded at the time of the sfsb transaction  less the fdic guaranteed portion of losses on covered assets 
see the asset quality discussion below for further analysis 
noninterest income for the year ended december   noninterest income equaled million  compared with million for the year ended december  this reduction of  was due to a decrease in gain on sale of securities of million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in other noninterest income also declined  for the year ended december  compared with the same period in other noninterest income was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  offsetting these declines  was a million reduction in loss on oreo  from a loss of million for the year ended december  to a loss of million for the same period in for the year ended december   noninterest income equaled million  compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of  losses on oreo during improved million compared with offsetting that improvement were declines in gain on sale of securities of  from million in to million in  and other noninterest income of  in compared with other noninterest income was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  other noninterest income for the year ended december  included net write downs and losses of  on covered oreo in the fdic acquired sfsb portfolio  comprised of million of write downs and sales offset by million due from the fdic 
the net amount reflects the company s loss portion under the shared loss agreements with the fdic 
noninterest expenses for the year ended december   noninterest expenses declined million  or  when compared with the same period in noninterest expenses were million for the year ended december  and declined to million for the same period in fdic indemnification asset amortization was the largest component of this change  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million or 
amortization of the fdic indemnification asset is the result of better than expected performance on the covered loan portfolio 
this better than expected performance also resulted in increased accretable yield and interest income on the covered loan portfolio 
fdic assessment decreased million  and was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the same period in  a decrease of 
other operating expenses were million and declined  from million for the year ended december  additional declines for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  were  in legal fees   in professional fees   in occupancy expenses   in equipment expenses   in salaries and employee benefits and  in data processing fees 
the decrease in legal fees and professional fees were primarily a reflection of improved credit quality 
other improvements reflect a concerted effort on the part of management to drive overhead expenses lower 
for the year ended december   noninterest expenses were million  declining  or million  from million for the year ended december  excluding an impairment of goodwill charge taken in  noninterest expenses would have increased by million  or  from million in this change was due primarily to accelerated fdic indemnification asset amortization of million  from million for to million for the increase in fdic indemnification asset amortization correlates to the increased yield realized in interest and fees on fdic covered loans over the same time frame  as projected losses carried within the fdic indemnification asset have been realized instead  through payment performance of the associated borrowers 
management continues to refine and enhance the methodology to amortize the 
table of contents indemnification asset based on the historical and projected cash flows of the fdic covered loan portfolio 
these enhancements should result in amortization of the indemnification asset that more closely correlates to the accretable yield of the fdic covered loan portfolio 
additionally  other operating expenses increased  from million in to million in  and fdic assessment increased by  from million to million over the same periods 
offsetting these increases in noninterest expense in compared to excluding the impairment of goodwill were decreases in salaries and employee benefits  which declined  or million  from million in to million in  and professional fees  which declined  or million  from million in to  in other decreases of  or more occurred in data processing  which declined  in  and equipment expense  which declined  in income taxes for the year ended december   income tax expense was million  compared with income tax expense of  and income tax benefit of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has evaluated the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance for the years ended december  and in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
based on a three year taxable income projection  tax strategies which would result in potential securities gains and the effects of off setting deferred tax liabilities  the company believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable 
therefore  no allowance was required 
asset quality non covered assets the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount appropriate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
non covered loan quality is continually monitored  and the company s management has established an allowance for loan losses that it believes is appropriate for the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
among other factors  management considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  the value and appropriateness of collateral and guarantors  non performing loans and current and anticipated economic conditions 
there are additional risks of future loan losses  which cannot be precisely quantified nor attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because those risks include general economic trends  as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
the allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to appropriateness  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies 
see allowance for loan losses on non covered loans in the critical accounting policies section above for further discussion 
the company maintains a list of non covered loans that have potential weaknesses and thus may need special attention 
this nonperforming loan list is used to monitor such loans and is used in the determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   nonperforming assets totaled million and net charge offs were million 
this compares with nonperforming assets of million and net charge offs of million for the year ended december  nonperforming non covered loans were million at december  compared to million at december   a million decrease 
approximately million in loans were placed on nonperforming status  of which million relate to loans for commercial real estate  residential real estate  and construction and land development  which are secured by real estate 
the remaining increase in nonperforming loans during are all smaller credit relationships 
offsetting the additions were million in charge offs taken during  of which two construction and land development loans totaled million 
the remaining charge offs were centered in commercial real estate  construction and land development  residential real estate  and commercial loans 
in  foreclosures totaled million  million in loans were reinstated to accruing status  and million in balances were paid down 
nonperforming non covered loans were million at december  compared to million at december   a million decrease 
approximately million in loans were placed in nonaccrual status 
approximately million of these additions relate to loans for commercial real estate  residential real estate  and construction and land development  which are secured by real estate 
the remaining increase in nonperforming loans during are all smaller credit relationships 
offsetting the additions were million in charge offs taken during  of which one commercial loan totaled million

the amount of this reserve was  as of december  impaired loans were not evaluated as pools in or at december   the company had construction and land development credit relationships in nonaccrual status 
the borrowers for nine of these relationships are residential land developers  and the borrower under the remaining loan is a commercial land developer 
all of the relationships are secured by the real estate to be developed  and almost all of such projects are in the company s central virginia market 
the total amount of the credit exposure outstanding at december  was million 
these loans have either been charged down or sufficiently reserved against to equate to the current expected realizable value 
during  the company charged off million with respect to three of these relationships 
the total amount of the allowance for loan losses attributed to all relationships was  at december   or of the total credit exposure outstanding 
the company establishes its reserves as described above in allowance for loan losses on non covered loans in the critical accounting policies section 
in conjunction with the impairment analysis the company performs as part of its allowance methodology  the company orders appraisals for all loans with balances in excess of  unless there existed an appraisal that was not older than months

the company performs troubled debt restructures tdr and other various loan workouts whereby an existing loan may be restructured into multiple new loans 
at december  and  the company had loans and loans  respectively  that met the definition of a tdr  which are loans that for reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties have been restructured on terms and conditions that would otherwise not be offered or granted 
there were three loans at december  and two loans at december  that were restructured using multiple new loans 
at december  and  the aggregated outstanding principal of these loans was million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were classified as nonaccrual 
the primary benefit of the restructured multiple loan workout strategy is to maximize the potential return by restructuring the loan into a good loan the a loan and a bad loan the b loan 
the impact on interest is positive because the bank is collecting interest on the a loan rather than potentially not collecting interest on the entire original loan structure 
the a loan is underwritten pursuant to the bank s standard requirements and graded accordingly 
the b loan is classified as either doubtful or loss 
an impairment analysis is performed on the b loan  and  based on its results  all or a portion of the b note is charged off or a specific loan loss reserve is established 

table of contents the company does not modify its nonaccrual policies in this arrangement  and the a loan and the b loan stand on their own terms 
at inception  this structure meets the definition of a tdr 
if the loan is on nonaccrual at the time of restructure  the a loan is held on nonaccrual until six consecutive payments have been received  at which time it may be put back on an accrual status 
the b loan is placed on nonaccrual 
under the terms of each loan  the borrower s payment is contractually due

the company seeks to maintain a strong capital base to support its growth and expansion plans  provide stability to current operations and promote public confidence in the company 
the adequacy of the company s capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis with reference to size  composition  and quality of the company s balance sheet 
moreover  capital levels are regulated and compared with industry standards 
management seeks to maintain a capital level exceeding regulatory statutes of well capitalized which is consistent to its overall growth plans  yet allows the company to provide the optimal return to its shareholders 
the federal banking regulators have defined three tests for assessing the capital strength and adequacy of banks  based on two definitions of capital 
tier capital is defined as common equity  retained earnings and qualifying perpetual preferred stock  less certain intangibles 
tier capital is defined as specific subordinated debt  some hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the loan loss allowance 
total capital is defined as tier capital plus tier capital 
three risk based capital ratios are computed using the above capital definitions  total assets and risk weighted assets and are measured against regulatory minimums to ascertain adequacy 
all assets and off balance sheet risk items are grouped into categories according to degree of risk and assigned a risk weighting and the resulting total is risk weighted assets 
tier risk based capital is tier capital divided by risk weighted assets 
total risk based capital is total capital divided by risk weighted assets 
the leverage ratio is tier capital divided by adjusted average total assets

financial ratios financial ratios give investors a way to compare companies within industries to analyze financial performance 
return on average assets is net income as a percentage of average total assets 
it is a key profitability ratio that indicates how effectively a bank has used its total resources 
return on average equity is net income as a percentage of average stockholders equity 
it provides a measure of how productively a company s equity has been employed 
dividend payout ratio is the percentage of net income paid to common stockholders as cash dividends during a given period 
the company did not pay dividends to common stockholders during the years ended december  and it is computed by dividing dividends per share by net income per common share 
the company utilizes leverage within guidelines prescribed by federal banking regulators as described in the section capital requirements in the preceding section 
leverage is average stockholders equity divided by average total assets

commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each client s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing clients 
those lines of credit may be drawn upon only to the total extent to which the company is committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to clients 
the company holds certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary

the goodwill impairment charge was a non cash  traditionally non recurring item that created the gaap loss for the year  and thus the supplemental performance measures exclude this item

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of interest rate risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over various periods  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated monthly 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point upward shift and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following table represents the change to net interest income given interest rate shocks up and down and basis points at december   and dollars in thousands change in net interest income change in yield curve bp bp most likely bp bp at december   the company s interest rate risk model indicated that  in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period  net interest income could decrease by 
for the same time period  the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points  net interest income could decrease by 
while these percentages are subjective based upon assumptions used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is appropriately balanced with acceptable risk to changes in interest rates 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels such as yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to  or in anticipation of  changes in interest rates
