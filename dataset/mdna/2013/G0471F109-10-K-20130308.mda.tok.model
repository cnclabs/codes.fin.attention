item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an international oil and gas exploration and production company focused on south america  with operations in argentina and colombia 
as of december   we had interests in nine oil and gas producing concessions and two exploration permits in argentina  and three exploration and production contracts in colombia 
our producing operations are located in the neuqu n  austral  san jorge and northwest basins in argentina and in the llanos basin in colombia 
although we have interests in several oil and gas properties in argentina  our primary focus is exploitation of our properties in the neuqu n basin in which we are partners with petrolera entre lomas 
we complement our legacy producing assets with exploration activities in both argentina and colombia 
our interests in argentina have been the core of our business for several decades  and we continually seek out properties in argentina basins where we have expertise in order to grow our business 
we also believe that colombia offers opportunities to add properties with excellent technical and economic characteristics to our portfolio 
we consider the investment and promotional climate and the oil and gas tax regime created by the colombian government over the past decade to be the most attractive in south america 
net income attributable to apco for was million compared with million for higher average sales prices were the primary contributor to increased operating revenues and greater equity income from argentine investment compared with also making a contribution to higher net income was a year over year volume increase of three percent for our combined consolidated and equity interests 
these favorable variances were partially offset by greater costs and operating expenses 
although we have benefited from the improved commodity price environment in argentina during  the business and political environment in argentina continues to be a significant risk to our business and results of operations 
inflation in argentina has been a persistent problem for several years and  with only a modest devaluation of the argentine peso in comparison to inflation rates  we have experienced significant increases in our us dollar cost of operations and capital expenditures 
increased governmental intervention that supports the value of the argentine peso and foreign exchange and capital controls present greater risks to future income levels expressed in us dollars and the timing and value of repatriations of cash from our argentine operations 
our capital expenditures totaled million in in addition to our net income mentioned above  operational highlights for include the following our first two wells drilled in colombia resulted in exploration discoveries in the llanos basin  with positive impacts to revenues and proved reserves for  exploration discoveries in the charco del palenque concession  successful development drilling campaign in our core neuqu n basin properties  increased total consolidated and equity sales volumes on a boe basis by three percent representing the tenth consecutive year of volume growth  and continued exploration efforts to produce from the vaca muerta shale 
outlook for we expect our oil prices to remain at current levels of around per barrel since the spread between the realized price in argentina and the international price of oil has diminished during exploration drilling in colombia will continue with three wells planned for the year 
with comparable levels of exploration drilling in colombia and coir n amargo  combined with expected concession extensions  we plan on increased capital expenditures compared with our primary objectives for are as follows conclude formal negotiations with the province of r o negro and obtain remaining approvals for the ten year concession extensions for our properties in tierra del fuego  continue development of existing fields and conventional exploration drilling in our core properties in the neuqu n basin  continue investigating the productive potential of the vaca muerta and molles shales in our properties in the neuqu n basin  commence exploration drilling in sur r o deseado este in southern argentina  and 
table of contents continue exploration drilling on block and perform testing operations on our turpial well in colombia 
our oil and gas capital expenditure budget for our consolidated interests is million 
for further discussion about our capital budget  see md a liquidity and capital resources in item of this report 
overview of business environment in argentina the business environment in argentina continues to be a significant challenge to our business 
since the presidential election in late  the government has increasingly used price controls  foreign exchange  trade  and capital controls to manage the economic challenges faced by the country 
during  the government has issued numerous decrees to regulate investments and profits and exert its influence in private sector operations in the energy industry 
in the second quarter  executive decree removed all exemptions from taxes and duties previously provided to oil and gas companies operating in the province of tierra del fuego through law  as a result of this decree  our operating revenues have decreased due to the loss of our right to retain value added tax collections associated with the sales of hydrocarbons to the continent and our operations in this province are prospectively subject to argentine federal income taxes since the issuance of the decree in may 
law  enacted by the argentine congress on may   authorized the expropriation of ypf and declared the oil and gas industry a matter of public interest 
in july  the government issued executive decree  which introduces important changes to the rules governing argentina s oil and gas industry 
the decree repeals certain articles of deregulation decrees passed during relating to free marketability of hydrocarbons at negotiated prices  the deregulation of the oil and gas industry  freedom to import and export hydrocarbons and the ability to keep proceeds from export sales in foreign bank accounts 
the repeal of these articles appears to formalize certain rules such as price controls and the repatriation of export sales proceeds which has been informally required by the government over the last several years 
in addition the decree creates a governmental strategic planning commission charged with developing investment plans for the country to increase production and reserves and to make argentina more energy self sufficient 
the decree also requires oil and gas companies  refiners and transporters of hydrocarbon products to submit annual investment plans for approval by the commission 
the decree empowers the commission to issue fines and sanctions  including concession removal  for companies that do not comply with its requirements 
finally  the commission is also charged with responsibility for assuring the reasonableness of hydrocarbon prices in the domestic market and that such prices allow companies to generate a reasonable profit margin 
regulations to implement the decree are pending 
until such regulations are published  we cannot fully assess the impact of this decree on our operations and profitability 
the text of this decree authorizes the federal government to enforce stricter controls over the oil and gas industry 
reaction by the provincial governments and the oil and gas industry may impact the manner in which the implementing regulations are written 
these events could discourage the influx of needed capital into argentina for oil and gas exploration and development  especially the continued exploration of argentina s unconventional potential 
although we cannot predict the impact of these events on our business  we have historically reinvested most of our earnings into the exploration and development of our properties in argentina with positive results to both oil and natural gas production and proved reserves 
for further discussion see  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk economic and political environment in item a of this report 
neuqu n basin properties we and our partners used two rigs throughout to execute our development and exploration drilling campaigns in the entre lomas  bajada del palo  charco del palenque and agua amarga areas 
total gross capital expenditures were approximately million for the year  or million net to our percent direct working interest and million attributable to our equity interest in petrolera 
during  we completed and put on production five wells that commenced drilling in for our drilling program  development wells and four exploration wells were spud during the year  of those wells were completed and put on production  and three wells were in various stages of drilling or completion at the end of the year 
we have a percent direct working interest and an effective percent equity interest in the wells mentioned above 

table of contents during  we continued exploration efforts to produce from the vaca muerta shale 
in the bajada del palo concession  we performed a fracture stimulation of the shale in an existing well  and we drilled another well in the western part of the concession known as aguada del poncho  performing a large fracture stimulation at the interface of the quintuco and vaca muerta formations 
the new well was put on production from the vaca muerta 
we also completed a three stage fracture stimulation in a well in the southern part of the coir n amargo block 
although the fracture stimulations in these three wells resulted in production from the vaca muerta  these wells have produced relatively modest volumes of oil and  subject to additional evaluation  we have preliminarily concluded that horizontal drilling with significantly larger fracture stimulations will be required to properly evaluate and ultimately exploit the vaca muerta shale as a resource play 
companies such as shell  eog and ypf are currently drilling horizontal wells in the vaca muerta formation 
results to date are inconclusive as the exploration of the vaca muerta in this basin is in the early stages and its productive behavior is not well understood 
the proper investigation and development of the vaca muerta will require both improved political and economic conditions in argentina to attract much needed capital and a larger presence of drilling and oil field service companies to help lower the cost of horizontal drilling and fracturing 
of the hundreds of drilled wells in which apco has participated since it first entered argentina  very few wells have been completed and placed on production in vaca muerta 
some of these wells have  however  accumulated significant volumes of oil as a result of having encountered vaca muerta in areas of natural fractures 
during  we plan to perform a fracture of the vaca muerta in a well drilled in in coir n amargo  and drill three additional wells targeting the formation in areas where natural fracture systems may be present 
concession contracts in argentina the concession terms for the portion of the entre lomas concession located in r o negro and for our tierra del fuego concessions currently end in approximately one half of the entre lomas concession  including our largest producing field  is located in the province of r o negro 
in general  the depletion life of many of our proved wells extends beyond and through the end of the concession extension period  and consequently  obtaining the ten year extension should lead to reserve upgrades that will result in a material increase in the volume of proved reserves 
in the second half of  the provinces of r o negro and tierra del fuego approved basic frameworks for the negotiation of the ten year concession extensions provided by argentina s hydrocarbon law 
the operators of the concessions are leading negotiations with the provinces on behalf of the joint venture partners  and significant advances were made with both provinces 
similar to the negotiations that were concluded with the province of neuqu n in  the requirements for extension include the negotiation of a cash bonus payment  an increase to provincial production taxes  and a future expenditure program 
provincial elections were held in the province of r o negro in late a new governor was elected and because of the transition to a new government during the first half of  there was no progress on the extension negotiations during this period 
as the year progressed  the governor proposed a new framework for negotiations of the ten year extensions with oil and gas producers in the province 
the proposed framework was approved by the provincial congress at the end of extension negotiations are expected to resume in the first half of  and we expect to obtain all required approvals during in the third quarter of  we and our partners in tierra del fuego signed agreements with the provincial government to approve the ten year extensions 
one agreement extends the concession term for the las violetas concession 
a second agreement extends the concession terms for the r o cullen and angostura concessions 
the ten year extensions for all three concessions run through august  nearly eight months have passed since the executed agreement was submitted to the legislature for approval 
this time period is longer than expected and as a result we can provide no assurance that the agreement will receive the required approval 
colombian properties as previously highlighted  our first two wells drilled in colombia resulted in exploration discoveries in the llanos basin  with positive impacts to revenues and proved reserves during the manice o no 
well drilled in the llanos block discovered light oil from the mirador formation and was put on production in july 
as of year end  the well had produced approximately thousand gross barrels  or thousand net  and was producing  gross barrels of oil per day after six months of production 
a second exploration well  the samaria norte no 
 successfully tested degree api gravity oil and 
table of contents is waiting on approval to be put on production from the guadalupe formation 
apco has a percent working interest in the llanos block 
in the fourth quarter of we drilled the committed exploration well on the turpial block 
prior to spudding the turpial well  our partner decided to commence the relinquishment of its interest in the block but agreed to pay its percent share of costs to total depth 
initial log interpretations were favorable and apco continued under sole risk provisions to case and cement the well for testing 
at the end of  apco entered another one year exploration phase by committing to drill an additional well  and has made plans to test the turpial well 
apco has applied to become operator of the block and currently holds a percent working interest pending government approval of the transfer of our partner interest to us 
in the llanos block where apco has a percent interest  we acquired d seismic data early in the first half of the year and interpretation of the data is underway 
we have committed to drill four exploration wells in the area by the end of  and we expect to begin building locations on the first two prospects during oil and natural gas marketing oil prices oil prices have a significant impact on our ability to generate earnings  fund capital projects  and pay shareholder dividends 
in general  oil prices are affected by many factors  including changes in market demands  global economic activity  political events  weather  and opec production quotas 
more importantly to apco  oil price realizations for oil produced and sold in argentina are significantly influenced by argentine governmental actions as described in the following paragraphs 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future prices  and therefore it is difficult for us to determine what effect increases or decreases in international product prices may have on our capital programs  production volumes  or future revenues 
in argentina  politically driven mechanisms significantly influence the sales price of oil produced and sold in the country 
to alleviate the impact of higher crude oil prices on argentina s economy and reduce inflation  the argentine government created an oil export tax and enacted price controls over gasoline prices to force producers and refiners to negotiate oil prices significantly below international market levels 
in colombia  oil price realizations are based on international reference prices such as wti or brent less transportation costs to deliver the crude to market 
in response to those governmental actions  argentine producers and refiners had to negotiate domestic oil prices that take into consideration both net backs for oil exported from argentina and the cost of feedstock to refiners in light of gasoline price controls 
consequently  apco did not benefit from increases in world oil prices over the past several years like producers outside of argentina 
however  gradual increases in gasoline prices from through have enabled producers to negotiate higher oil prices with refiners 
the trend of increasing gasoline prices combined with tighter demand for our high quality crude oil has resulted in higher oil price realizations compared with prior years 
our oil price per barrel for our consolidated interests averaged for compared with for and in because our production from our colombian properties accounted for only five percent of our consolidated oil volumes sold in  the impact of higher price realizations in colombia was not material for hydrocarbon subsidy programs low oil prices in argentina have inhibited oil exploration investments and consequent oil discoveries in argentina resulting in insufficient replacement of domestic production and a decline in oil reserves in the country over the past several years 
in order to reverse this trend and promote increased oil production and reserves  the argentine government created various hydrocarbon subsidy programs in including the oil plus program 
the programs grant qualifying companies economic benefits in the form of tax credit certificates which can be applied to the payment of export duties paid on hydrocarbon exports or transferred to third parties at face value 
we did not realize any benefit from the oil plus program until during  we recognized approximately million net to our consolidated interests related to hydrocarbon subsidy programs see results of operations other operating revenues below  and approximately million net to our equity interest see results of operations investment income below 
both we and petrolera have applied for additional benefits under the oil plus program  however  in february  the argentine government stated its intention to suspend benefits under the oil plus program and temporarily ceased paying subsidies to producers 
consequently  we did not realize any benefit from this program in despite the government stated intention to suspend benefits under these programs  they have allowed companies producing relatively smaller amounts of production to apply for subsidies 
in february  the government allowed a related party of ours to 
table of contents utilize approximately million of tax certificates that had originally been granted to apco 
we continue to apply for additional subsidies under this program  but we cannot predict if either apco or petrolera will be able to recognize any further benefits from this program 
we cannot accurately predict how world oil prices will evolve in and beyond or what additional actions the argentine government will take in response to future fluctuations in world oil prices  the drop in the level of the country s oil reserves or in reaction to changes in the country s fiscal and trade balances 
natural gas prices we sell our natural gas to argentine customers pursuant to contracts and spot market sales 
as a consequence of the growth in argentina s economy over the past several years  and stimulated by low natural gas prices resulting from a price freeze implemented by the argentine government in  demand for natural gas in argentina has grown significantly 
however  the unfavorable price environment for producers has discouraged natural gas exploration activities 
without significant new discoveries of natural gas reserves in argentina  the supply of natural gas has failed to keep up with increased demand 
the result is a natural gas and power supply shortage in the country 
since  the argentine government has taken several steps to prevent shortages in the domestic market 
natural gas exports to chile were suspended and the country began importing natural gas from bolivia at significantly greater prices than sales prices for natural gas produced in argentina 
in addition  argentina was forced to import high priced lng 
the argentine government regulates the supply of natural gas and provides a framework for natural gas prices in the domestic market through resolution referred to as the acuerdo the resolution is intended to provide for equitable sharing of all sectors of the internal natural gas market among producers and establishes a mechanism for doing so based on average natural gas volumes produced from to the resolution determines which sectors of the market will have priority during periods of peak demand 
during peak periods  the residential market will have first priority 
with respect to the lower priced residential market  each producer s share of the residential market will be distributed based on an allocation of its volumes produced during the period to  while natural gas production in excess of those volumes can be sold to electric power generators at regulated prices  and industrial customers at freely negotiated prices 
in december  the acuerdo was extended until the secretary of energy issues another resolution to regulate natural gas markets in argentina 
through the gas plus program  the government has created a mechanism for producers to obtain government approval to negotiate higher prices with industrial customers if the producer has explored and found new reserves 
we receive some benefits related to this program 
our average natural gas sale price per mcf averaged in  in  and during the level of gas reserves in argentina has fallen in recent years in a country that relies on natural gas for more than percent of its energy consumption 
given the government s tendency to intervene over pricing of a commodity in such high demand  we cannot predict how argentine natural gas prices will evolve in and beyond or whether the current argentine government will continue to maintain tight controls over prices or decide to loosen price controls in response to falling production and reserves 
in order to reverse the trend of declining reserves  in february  the government issued resolution which creates a new incentive mechanism to realize higher natural gas prices 
the decree creates a program called the programa de est mulo a la inyecci n excedente de gas natural which is intended to provide incentives for exploration drilling for certain projects 
our preliminary understanding of the resolution is that it allows each natural gas producer to negotiate a base decline curve for its existing deliveries and to commit investments and production deliveries above that curve 
the resulting incremental deliveries are eligible for a price differential payment from the government to effectively raise a company realized price up to per mmbtu during a five year period 
additionally  failure to meet committed deliveries would result in significant penalties 
companies have a very limited window to participate in this new program because the new investment projects must be presented for approval by june  we are evaluating if apco will be able to benefit from this program in the future 
seasonality of the products we sell  only natural gas is subject to seasonal demand 
demand for natural gas in argentina is reduced during the warmer months of october through april  with generally lower natural gas prices during this off peak period 
during  natural gas sales represented percent of our total operating revenues compared with percent in and percent in consequently  the fluctuation in natural gas sales between summer and winter is not significant to us 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that these particular estimates and assumptions are critical due to their subjective nature and inherent uncertainties  the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the following accounting estimates and assumptions as well as related disclosures with our audit committee 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of our proved reserves included in the unaudited supplemental oil and gas information in this report are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by us gaap and by the sec 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and iv the judgment of the reserve engineers and geologists that prepare the estimate 
our proved reserve information is based on estimates prepared by our reserve engineers 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing  and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
our proved reserves are limited to the concession life 
certain of our existing concession terms can be extended for ten years with the consent of and based on terms to be agreed with the argentine government 
the extension of our concessions could materially affect our estimate of proved reserves 
the present value of future net cash flows should not be assumed to be the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the  and estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price received for the period january through december with the most current cost information 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in the estimate 
our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record depreciation expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of oil and gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when we believe events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
our assessments use judgments and assumptions that include the undiscounted future cash flows  discounted future cash flows  estimated fair values  and the current and future economic environment in which the asset is operated 
typical indicators of a possible impairment include declining oil and gas prices  unfavorable revisions to our reserve estimates  drilling results  or future drilling plans 
in our review of unproved properties as of december   we determined that a portion of an exploratory well that had been drilled but is pending the determination of proved reserves was impaired due to substantial doubt about the economic viability of a particular formation of interest in the well 
only a portion of the well was impaired because we concluded that sufficient progress is being made to assess the reserves from higher formations in the well 
as a result  we recognized approximately thousand of impairment charges in the fourth quarter of depending upon the results of certain future exploration activities  we could determine that additional unproved properties need to be impaired as we drill and evaluate those areas 
for example  we have million of unproved property acquisition cost related to our operations in colombia and million in exploratory wells pending the determination of proved reserves 
if our exploration activity planned for is unsuccessful  we may have to recognize an impairment loss related to these assets 
in addition to the unproved properties described above for which an impairment charge was recorded  one of our proved properties was reviewed for which no impairment was required 
this review assessed impairment using estimates of future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions in these assessments include estimates of reserves quantities  estimates of future commodity prices  contractual rights  drilling plans and expected capital costs 
the use of alternate judgments and assumptions could result in the recognition of different levels of impairment charges in the consolidated financial statements 
for the property for which impairment charges were not recorded  we estimate that approximately million could be at risk for future impairments if we do not make sufficient economic discoveries to justify the conversion of an exploration area into a concession and are forced to relinquish a portion of our property

total costs and operating expenses increased by million  or percent  primarily due to the following items production and lifting costs increased by million  or percent  due to the growth of our operations in the neuqu n basin and the impact of inflation on operation and maintenance expenses  and the commencement of production from our colombian properties in the second half of  transportation and storage increased by million primarily due to trucking expense to deliver our oil production to market in colombia  selling and administrative expense increased by million due to increased staffing  the effect of inflation on salary and related benefits expense and other administrative costs in our argentine branch  greater costs from our operators in argentina  and higher corporate administrative expenses  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by million primarily due to higher depreciation rates and the impact of production from colombia see additional discussion below  and exploration expense increased by million primarily due to greater exploration activity including d seismic acquisition costs in the llanos block in colombia and in the sur r o deseado este concession in argentina and for impairment charges related to exploration drilling  foreign exchange loss gains increased by thousand compared with during  a loss of thousand from our argentine operations was offset by a gain of thousand from our colombian operations 
in future periods  we expect to experience greater foreign exchange losses as a result of an expected increase in net monetary assets denominated in argentine pesos combined with a devaluation of the argentine peso  and partially offsetting the increased expenses mentioned above was a million decrease in other expense primarily due to a gain from a farm out agreement in the sur r o deseado este concession realized in the second quarter of 
table of contents vs 
total costs and operating expenses increased by million  or percent  primarily due to the following items production and lifting costs increased by million  or percent  due to due to greater operation and maintenance expenses related to our neuqu n basin properties 
these increases were driven primarily by the impact of inflation in argentina and increased activity that included the addition of an extra pulling unit used for repairing producing wells with down hole problems that caused those wells to be temporarily shut in  taxes other than income increased by million primarily due to higher provincial production taxes as a result of higher sales prices and greater operating revenues and a higher effective provincial production rate due to increased sales volumes from concessions with higher rates  also included the following unusual items a thousand provincial production tax settlement covering prior periods with the province of r o negro  a thousand special colombian equity tax  and an adjustment of thousand related to personal asset tax in argentina  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by million primarily due to higher depreciation rates see additional discussion below  and partially offsetting the increased expenses mentioned above was a million decrease in exploration expense due to lower exploration activity including acquiring less d seismic information

our dd a rate increased because in the r o negro province  where our largest producing field with the largest proved reserves is located  we have been adding less proved reserves per well drilled for calculating dd a with each year that passes without obtaining the remaining ten year extension as our proved reserves are limited to the current concession life 
furthermore  as we develop our most mature fields  proved reserves added per well decrease over time 
additionally  our weighted average dd a rate increased in due to a greater proportion of sales volumes on a barrel of oil equivalent basis from properties with dd a rates that are higher than the weighted average rate experienced in 
table of contents we are working to obtain the ten year concession extension for our properties in r o negro  and are waiting on legislative approval for our extensions in tierra del fuego

investment income vs 
total investment income increased by million compared with due to greater equity income from argentine investment 
the increase in our equity income is due to an increase in the net income of our equity investee  petrolera

total investment income increased by million compared with due to greater equity income from argentine investment 
the increase in our equity income is due to an increase in the net income of our equity investee  petrolera 
the comparative increase in petrolera s net income is primarily a result of greater revenues driven by higher oil sales prices and benefits received by petrolera from the oil plus program  partially offset by petrolera s share of a provincial production tax settlement with the province of r o negro for further discussion of these items  see md a oil and natural gas marketing oil prices hydrocarbon subsidy programs in item of this report 
income taxes vs 
income taxes increased by million compared with due to higher operating income in argentina 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further discussion of income taxes 
vs 
although income taxes increased by thousand compared with  the effective income tax rate on the total provision for is lower than the effective income tax rate in primarily due to the greater amounts of exploration activity in colombia in which provided no benefit to income tax expense during the period and increased equity income from argentine investment which is presented on an after tax basis 
liquidity and capital resources outlook our cash flow from operations is highly sensitive to fluctuations in our oil price realizations 
oil price realizations in argentina have increased gradually since from approximately per barrel 
since the beginning of  oil prices have stabilized and averaged approximately per barrel for the year 
we derive more than percent of our total revenues from the sale of oil 
since the international price of oil has decreased significantly during and the spread between the price being realized in argentina and the international price of oil has diminished considerably  we expect our oil prices to remain at current levels or trend downward 
oil price realizations in argentina continue to be negotiated on a short term basis 
dividends received from our equity investee  petrolera  are a significant contributor to our cash flow generated by operating activities and petrolera s cash flows from operations and its ability to pay dividends are also highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil price realizations 
petrolera s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon numerous factors  including its cash flows provided by operating activities  levels of capital spending  changes in crude oil and natural gas prices  debt and interest payments  and the argentine government s foreign exchange control policies 
inflation in argentina has been a persistent problem for some time 
in contrast  the argentine peso has not experienced a commensurate level of devaluation resulting in considerable increases in our us dollar cost of operations and capital expenditures 
consequently  there is no assurance that operating income generated in argentina will remain at current levels given that oil prices in argentina have stabilized during the year  inflation continues at robust levels and the peso has not been allowed to adjust to market conditions 
since the fourth quarter of  the argentine government has implemented various regulations restricting access to foreign exchange markets  or the purchase of foreign currency through the central bank of argentina at the official rate of exchange for the purpose of depositing funds in foreign accounts 
these restrictions require both central bank and afip argentina s taxing authority approvals that are not currently being given 
as a result  the current movement of funds out of 
table of contents argentina through the central bank at the official exchange rate has been obstructed 
however  the purchase of foreign currency for the repayment of debt is not limited 
under current regulatory conditions  it is possible that future dividends paid by petrolera could be paid in pesos in argentina

we will continue to monitor our capital programs as necessary to provide apco with the financial resources and liquidity needed to continue development drilling in our core properties over the long term  fund new investment opportunities  meet future working capital needs and fund any further cash bonus payments that may be negotiated to obtain concession extensions  if any  while maintaining sufficient liquidity to reasonably protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring the use of funds 
capital exploration expenditures budget for our capital plan provides for million of capital expenditures net to our direct working interests 
we plan to participate in the drilling of gross wells in in addition  we plan on spending approximately million for the acquisition of seismic information 
after taking into consideration the portion of capital expenditures attributable to our equity interest in petrolera  our combined consolidated and equity capital expenditure budget for is million 
any cash bonus payments that may be negotiated to obtain concession extensions would result in additional capital expenditures 
we expect that we and petrolera will have sufficient capital resources to fund our investment programs in we review our capital spending programs throughout the year in light of any changing economic or price conditions and  if necessary  will adjust our planned investments accordingly 
we expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash flows from operations 
liquidity although we have interests in several oil and gas properties in argentina  our direct participation in those neuqu n basin properties in which we are partners with petrolera and dividends from our equity interest in petrolera are the largest contributors to our net cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  in the third quarter of we began producing oil from our operations in colombia  creating a source of cash flow outside of argentina 
although we generally fund our capital programs with internally generated cash flow  successful exploration efforts in argentina or colombia could lead to development capital needs that are currently beyond our ability to fund from operations 
as a result of the current exchange control restrictions that have obstructed the ability to move funds out of argentina at the official rate of exchange  apco and petrolera have increased capital spending in argentina to the extent possible and petrolera has accelerated repayments of its loans denominated in foreign currency us dollars 
consequently  we received fewer dividends from our investment in petrolera during compared with we continue to operate our business under the assumption that the receipt of dividends abroad from our investment in petrolera will contribute to the funding of our operations outside of argentina 
however  because of the current regulatory environment  the receipt of dividends abroad from our investment in petrolera may not be a reliable source of funding for our operations outside of argentina in the near term  and consequently we may need other sources of funding  including drawing down our existing cash reserves  to meet our plans and exploration commitments outside of argentina 
with a cash and cash equivalents balance at december   of million  or percent of total assets  and the ability to adjust capital spending as necessary  we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to effectively manage our business in our liquidity is affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for letters of credit for exploration activities in colombia 
as of december   a total of million was considered restricted and included in restricted cash 
we expect our restricted cash to be reduced by million in the first half of due to fulfilling certain exploration commitments 
the restricted cash is invested in a short term money market account with a financial institution

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks as a result of changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity price risk we have historically not used derivatives to hedge price volatility 
oil sales price realizations for oil produced and sold in argentina are significantly influenced by argentine governmental actions 
in the current regulatory environment  the combination of hydrocarbon export taxes and strict government controls over argentine gasoline prices directly impacts price realizations for the sale of crude oil in the domestic argentine market 
as a result  our price is impacted more by government controls than changes in world oil prices 
because our oil prices are negotiated on a short term basis  we cannot accurately predict our future sales prices  and it is difficult for us to determine what effect increases or decreases in world oil prices may have on our results of operations 
furthermore  although our oil prices in argentina are negotiated and denominated in us dollars  we are paid in pesos 
this could make our oil price realizations sensitive to currency devaluation depending on the manner in which any possible devaluation is implemented by the government 
inflation  foreign currency and operations risk the majority of our operations are located in argentina 
historically argentina has struggled through extended periods of inflation that have eventually led to a sudden devaluation of the argentine peso similar to what occurred during the argentine economic crisis of and since the economic crisis of and  when the value of the peso was suddenly reduced from an exchange rate of one peso to one us dollar to an exchange rate of three pesos to one us dollar  the argentine economy has generally grown at strong rates ranging from two to ten percent annually 
however  actual inflation escalated during this same period at rates ranging from to percent annually over the last several years 
as a result of government efforts to support the value of the peso in this environment  the peso s value has not declined in proportion to the level of actual inflation thereby substantially increasing the cost of living in argentina and the us dollar cost of our operations and capital expenditures in the country 
because the peso has not been permitted to devalue in proportion to the actual inflation experienced in the country  there has been  in the recent past  capital flight out of argentina due to a lack of confidence in the value of the peso at the official exchange rate 
in october of and july of  the government implemented regulations restricting access to foreign exchange markets  including the purchase of foreign currency us dollars through the central bank of argentina at the official rate of exchange 
these regulations were augmented by formal and informal restrictions including approvals from both the central bank and afip which are not currently being given 
as a result  movement of funds out of argentina through the central bank at the official exchange rate has been obstructed 
the purchase of foreign currency for transactions such as the repayment of debt is not limited 
companies that are generating free cash flow find themselves accumulating local currency in argentina 
an alternative way for companies to send money out of argentina exists and consists of purchasing marketable securities in argentina with pesos and selling them abroad in foreign currency 
as of december   the implicit exchange rate derived from this type of transaction was approximatly percent above the official exchange rate 
the resulting spread between such implicit exchange rate and the official rate of exchange could be an indicator that an official devaluation of the argentine peso may be required at some point 
a devaluation of the argentine peso could result in foreign exchange losses to the extent of net monetary assets held by us in argentine pesos that are translated on the balance sheet at the closing exchange rate 
a devaluation could also lower our product price realizations and reduce our peso denominated costs 
at december   the peso to us dollar official rate of exchange rate was at december   the official exchange rate was and our net monetary assets denominated in argentine pesos was million 
additionally  petrolera had a balance of net monetary assets denominated in pesos of approximately million as of december  economic and political environment argentina has a history of economic and political instability 
because our operations are predominately located in argentina  our operations and financial results have been  and could be in the future  adversely affected by economic  market  currency  and political instability in argentina  as well as measures taken by its government in response to such 
table of contents instability 
argentina s economic and political situation continues to evolve  and the argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that may materially impact  among other items  i the realized prices we receive for the commodities we produce and sell  ii the timing of repatriations of cash to the cayman islands  iii our asset valuations  iv the dollar value of peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities  and v restrictions on imports of materials necessary for our operations 
in october  president cristina kirchner was re elected for a second term 
her first term was highlighted by energy policies that controlled prices of hydrocarbons  in particular natural gas prices  subsidies for the import of natural gas at prices far higher than those permitted for the sale of natural gas produced in argentina  close alliances with labor unions  and a monetary policy designed to support the value of the peso 
additionally  the government has taken various measures to assert greater state control over different areas of the country s economy  including nationalizing an airline and private pension funds 
since the presidential election in late  the government has increasingly used foreign exchange  trade  price and capital controls to manage the economic challenges faced by the country 
during  the government has issued numerous decrees to regulate investments and profits and exert its influence in private sector operations in the energy industry  including the expropriation of percent of the shares of ypf from repsol 
these actions have created an unpredictable political and business environment in the country 
the stated objective of the argentine government is to increase both conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas production in argentina through increased investments by ypf  now majority owned by the argentine government 
ypf has announced an aggressive multi year investment plan designed to achieve that objective and various potential joint venture partnerships to help fund this program 
as a result of these actions and events  and in spite of the ypf announcement  the share price of ypf and many other public companies with oil and gas interests in argentina have fallen off precipitously  as have the shares of apco 
although we cannot predict the impact of these events on our business  we have historically reinvested most of our earnings into the exploration and development of our properties in argentina with positive results to both oil and natural gas production and proved reserves
