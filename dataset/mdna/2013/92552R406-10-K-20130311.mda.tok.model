financial highlights the following financial highlights are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap viad corp consolidated total revenues of billion  an increase of percent from revenues net income attributable to viad of million  as compared to million in diluted income per share of  as compared to in acquisition of the banff international hotel for million on march  restructuring charges totaling million primarily related to reorganization activities in the marketing events group  comprised of the elimination of certain positions and facility consolidations income tax expense charge of million representing a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards income from discontinued operations of  primarily related to the sale of land associated with previously sold operations cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  debt was million as of december  marketing events us revenues of million  an increase of percent from revenues segment operating income of million  as compared to a loss of million in 
table of contents marketing events international revenues of million  an increase of percent from revenues segment operating income of million  as compared to million in travel recreation group revenues of million  an increase of percent from revenues segment operating income of million  as compared to million in non gaap measure the following discussion includes a presentation of adjusted ebitda  which is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons 
adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income attributable to viad before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
this non gaap measure should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda primarily as a performance measure and believes that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this non gaap measure is net income attributable to viad 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  non cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes  impairment losses or recoveries  and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
because adjusted ebitda does not consider the above items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net income attributable to viad as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of the company s performance 
a reconciliation of net income attributable to viad to adjusted ebitda is as follows in thousands net income attributable to viad impairment losses interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization income from discontinued operations adjusted ebitda the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from to was primarily due to higher segment operating results at all operating segments  partially offset by higher restructuring charges and corporate costs 
the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from to was primarily driven by higher segment operating results in the marketing events group 
see results of operations below for a discussion of fluctuations

marketing events group 
revenues for the marketing events us segment were million for  up percent  as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to base same show revenue increases of percent and positive show rotation of approximately million 
management defines base same show revenues as revenues from exhibitions and events that occur in the same quarter and same city every year 
base same shows represented percent of marketing events us segment revenues in the segment operating income was million  as compared to a loss of million in the improved operating results were primarily due to an increase in revenues with a continued focus on margin improvements  as well as ongoing efforts to drive operating efficiencies and control discretionary expenses 
the company is continuing to execute against a number of margin improvement initiatives designed to more effectively manage labor costs across the marketing events group and to reduce the physical footprint and the overhead associated with the us warehousing operation 
as it relates to labor costs  the focus is on driving productivity gains through rigorous and strategic pre show planning on the highest opportunity events 
the benefits of such measures are shown by a half point reduction in the variable labor to revenue ratio on a us base same show basis 
the company is also working to develop new tools to support and systematize show site labor planning  measurement and benchmarking 
on the facility side  approximately  square feet of warehouse space has been eliminated during  reducing the total us warehouse footprint to approximately million square feet as of december  due to the cost savings efforts  the company has recognized a us facility cost savings of approximately million for  as compared to revenues for the marketing events international segment were million for  up percent  as compared to million in segment operating income was million in  as compared to million in as discussed above  period to period comparisons for this segment were affected by exchange rate variances  which had an unfavorable impact on revenues of million and segment operating income of  as compared to excluding exchange rate variances  revenues increased by million  or percent  and operating income increased by million  or percent 
these increases were primarily driven by services provided for the london summer olympics and paralympic games  as well as increased demand and new show wins  partially offset by net negative show rotation revenues of approximately million 

table of contents although the marketing events group has a diversified revenue base and long term contracts for future shows  its revenues are affected by general economic and industry specific conditions 
the prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows 
in general  the exhibition and event industry is experiencing modest improvement 
following quarterly declines from the third quarter of through the first quarter of  marketing events us base same show revenues were essentially flat in the second quarter of and have increased in each of the following nine quarters 
base same show revenues for the fourth quarter of were essentially flat  reflecting growth across the majority of base same shows offset by a decline in a major show in the government sector 
for the full year  management expects us base same show revenues to increase at a low to mid single digit rate and show rotation to have a net negative impact on full year revenue of approximately million to million 
although the marketing events group will not benefit from non annual shows in as it did in  management expects to reach a full year operating margin of approximately percent in through improved operating efficiencies and new business wins 
additionally  management anticipates that foreign currency exchange rate variances versus will not have a meaningful impact on the marketing events group s full year revenues and segment operating income 
management remains focused on improving the profitability of the marketing events us segment through continued integration and consolidation of operations to increase capacity utilization and reduce costs 
additional restructuring charges may be incurred as further cost structure improvements are made 
the marketing events group is subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs  about one third of which expire each year 
although labor relations between the company and labor are currently stable  disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur  with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of the marketing events group

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to viad  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on october of each year 
goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
viad s reporting units are defined  and goodwill is tested  at either an operating segment level or at the component level of an operating segment  depending on various factors including the internal reporting structure of the operating segment  the level of integration among components  the sharing of assets and other resources among components and the benefits and likely recoverability of goodwill by the component s operations 
for impairment testing purposes  the goodwill related to the marketing events us segment is assigned to and tested at the operating segment level  which represents all domestic operations of ges 
furthermore  the goodwill related to the marketing events international segment is assigned to and tested based on the segment s geographical operations 
for the marketing events international segment the reporting units are united kingdom melville ges and canada 
brewster  glacier park and alaska denali travel are considered reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
as of december   viad had total goodwill of million consisting of million related to the marketing events group and million related to the travel recreation group 
the following table summarizes goodwill balances by reporting unit and segment as of december in thousands marketing events group marketing events us marketing events international united kingdom melville ges ges canada total marketing events group travel recreation group brewster glacier park alaska denali travel total travel recreation group total goodwill viad uses a discounted expected future cash flow methodology income approach in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
the most critical assumptions and estimates in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units relate to the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows for each reporting unit and the reporting unit cost of capital discount rate applied to those cash flows 
furthermore  the assumed reporting unit cost of capital rates discount rates are estimated using a build up method based on the perceived risk associated with the cash flows pertaining to the specific reporting unit 
in order to assess the reasonableness of its fair value estimates  the company performs a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to viad s market capitalization 

table of contents as noted above  the estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows  discount rates and terminal values require considerable judgment and are based on market conditions  financial forecasts  industry trends and historical experience 
these estimates  however  have inherent uncertainties and different assumptions could lead to materially different results 
as of december   viad had aggregate goodwill of million recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
furthermore  as a result of the company s most recent impairment analysis performed in october  the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value expressed as a percentage of the carrying amounts under step one of the impairment test was percent  percent and percent for each of the marketing events group reporting units in the united states  the united kingdom melville ges and canada  respectively 
for the brewster  glacier park and alaska denali travel reporting units  the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value was percent  percent and percent  respectively  as of the most recent impairment test 
significant reductions in the company s expected future revenues  operating income or cash flow forecasts and projections  or an increase in reporting unit cost of capital  could trigger additional goodwill impairment testing  which may result in impairment losses 
income taxes viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  the company must estimate its actual current income tax liability  and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes  as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
the company uses significant judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and evaluates the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
as of december  and  viad had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
these deferred tax assets reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized upon reversal of deductible temporary differences  and the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company considered all available positive and negative evidence regarding the future recoverability of its deferred tax assets  including the company s recent operating history  taxpaying history and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities 
the company also evaluated its ability to utilize its foreign tax credits  given its recent utilization history 
these tax credits are subject to a year carryforward period and begin to expire in based on the company s assessment  it was determined during the fourth quarter of that the weight of the evidence indicated that certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards no longer met the more likely than not test regarding the realization of those assets 
accordingly  the company recorded a valuation allowance related to all of its foreign tax credit carryforwards as of december   which resulted in a charge to income tax expense of million 
during  the company increased its valuation allowance related to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards by  as of december  and  viad had a valuation allowance of million and  respectively  related to those state and foreign deferred tax assets 
with respect to all other deferred tax assets  management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more likely than not 
as noted above  viad uses considerable judgment in forming a conclusion regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
as a result  there are inherent uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of these assets  which is primarily dependent on viad s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods 
in future periods  it is reasonably possible that the relative weight of positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of viad s deferred tax assets may change  which could result in a material increase in the company s valuation allowance 
if such an increase in the valuation allowance were to occur  it would result in increased income tax expense in the period the assessment was made 
insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability and property loss claims 
the aggregate amount of insurance liabilities up to the company s retention limit related to viad s continuing operations was million as of december  of this total  million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general auto liability claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling million as of december   primarily related to workers compensation liabilities 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels  which generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
viad does not maintain a self insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement 
viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents in addition  as of december   viad has recorded insurance liabilities of million related to continuing operations in excess of the self insured levels for which viad remains the primary obligor 
of this total  million related to worker s compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general liability claims 
the company has presented these amounts as other deferred items and liabilities with a corresponding receivable in other investments and assets 
pension and postretirement benefits viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
the company presently anticipates contributing million to its funded pension plans and million to its unfunded pension plans in viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for these benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad expects to contribute  to the plans in the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was percent  declining one half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was nine percent  declining one half percent each year to the ultimate rate of five percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the total of service and interest cost components by approximately  the weighted average assumptions used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december were as follows domestic plans funded plans unfunded plans postretirement benefit plans foreign plans discount rate the weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost were as follows domestic plans funded plans unfunded plans postretirement benefit plans foreign plans discount rate expected return on plan assets n a n a the discount rates used in determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations are based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and management review  and reflect the estimated rates of return on a high quality  hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flows match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments

share based compensation viad grants share based compensation awards to officers  directors and certain key employees pursuant to the viad corp omnibus incentive plan which has a year life and provides for the following types of awards a incentive and non qualified stock options  b restricted stock and restricted stock units  c performance units or performance shares  d stock appreciation rights  e cash based awards and f certain other stock based awards 
share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
furthermore  the total tax benefits related to such costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
no share based compensation costs were capitalized during  or 
table of contents the fair value of restricted stock and performance based restricted stock awards are based on viad s stock price on the date of grant 
liability based awards are recorded at estimated fair value  based on the number of units expected to vest and the level of achievement of predefined performance goals where applicable and are remeasured on each balance sheet date based on viad s stock price until the time of settlement 
viad uses the black scholes option pricing model for purposes of determining the fair value of each stock option grant for which key assumptions are necessary 
these assumptions include viad s expected stock price volatility  the expected period of time the stock option will remain outstanding  the expected dividend yield on viad s common stock  and the risk free interest rate 
while the company has not granted stock options since  changes in the assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value of stock option grants  and consequently impact viad s future results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk viad s market risk exposures relate to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect viad s financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the earnings of viad 
commodity risk is the risk that changing prices will adversely affect results of operations 
viad conducts its foreign operations primarily in canada  the united kingdom  germany and to a lesser extent in certain other countries 
the functional currency of viad s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
accordingly  for purposes of consolidation  viad translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries into us dollars at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the unrealized gains or losses resulting from the translation of these foreign denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar may result in material changes to viad s net equity position reported in its consolidated balance sheets 
viad does not currently hedge its equity risk arising from the translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
viad had cumulative unrealized foreign currency translation gains recorded in stockholders equity of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during and  an unrealized foreign currency translation gain of million and a loss of million  respectively  were recorded in other comprehensive income 
in addition  for purposes of consolidation  the revenues  expenses  gains and losses related to viad s foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the period 
as a result  viad s consolidated results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates as the operating results of its foreign operations  when translated  may vary from period to period  even when the functional currency amounts have not changed 
such fluctuations may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons 
viad does not currently hedge its net earnings exposure arising from the translation of its foreign operating results

from time to time  viad utilizes forward contracts to mitigate the impact on earnings related to these transactions due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
as of december  and  viad did not have any significant foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
viad is exposed to short term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations 
viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations 
viad s subsidiaries have exposure to changing fuel prices 
periodically  brewster enters into futures contracts with an oil company to purchase two types of fuel and specifies the monthly total volume  by fuel product  to be purchased over the agreed upon term of the contract  which is generally no longer than one year 
the main objective of viad s risk policy related to changing fuel prices is to reduce transaction exposure in order to mitigate the cash flow risk and protect profit margins 
there were no fuel contracts outstanding as of december  or
