our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated audited financial statements and related notes  as well as the risk factors and other information contained in this annual report 
the discussion is based upon  among other things  our consolidated audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to  among other things  make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent liabilities at the financial statement dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we review our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on our historical 
table of contents experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations  although they could

overview and recent developments we are a provider of wireless handsets which may be referred to herein as phones  cell phones  mobile phones  feature phones and smartphones and accessories to carriers  distributors and oems in latin america  asia pacific  europe and africa 
we design  develop  source and sell our proprietary line of products under the verykool brand and on a private label basis to certain customers collectively referred to as verykool products 
verykool products include entry level  mid tier and high end feature phones and android based smartphones 
we first introduced the verykool brand in  and have been working to gain brand identity and grow sales 
we are now in the midst of a transformation of our company as we move from our former existence as a distributor of phones designed  developed and manufactured by others  to our new business model of designing  manufacturing  sourcing and selling our own verykool products 
during the year ended december   of our sales were comprised of verykool products and we are now focused on growing our revenue base for these products 
for the past five years  our business has had two primary components legacy distribution of wireless handsets supplied by major manufacturers  primarily samsung  and provision of our own proprietary verykool products that we originally sourced from independent design houses and original design manufacturers odms 
our revenue peaked in when we recorded approximately million of net sales 
in  more than of our net sales of approximately million were derived from distribution sales of samsung product to carriers in argentina 
in late  however  a stiff import tariff on certain electronic devices  including wireless handsets  was enacted in argentina 
the tariff had a significant negative impact on our sales beginning in the first quarter of  and ultimately resulted in a decrease of of our sales volume in compared to then  in february  argentina enacted a further import regulation effective march  which signaled the closing stage of our distribution business 
our distribution agreement with samsung was scheduled to expire december  but was extended until march  to accommodate the orderly conclusion of this business 
since april   our business has and will continue to be centered on our verykool product line 
prior to we sourced all our verykool phones from independent design houses and odms in china 
in late  with a desire to improve our time to market  better protect our technology and know how and improve our cost structure  we began to search for an experienced management team to serve as the core for an in house design team based in beijing 
in april we recruited a team of very experienced management and technical personnel who now serve as both our design house for all our markets and as the base for marketing and selling our products in asia pacific 
this team currently consists of employees  primarily engineers  located in beijing 
the quarter ended june  was the first full quarter of operation of our china subsidiary 
its expenses are classified as r d expenses on our statement of operations  together with any nre non recurring engineering expenses paid to other design houses 
we shipped our first product designed by our china team to a customer in china in october and shipped other new models to customers during although we expect to continue to use outside design houses to augment the efforts of our china development team  in we plan to increase the portion of our portfolio of products that are internally designed 
all of our manufacturing continues to be done by contract manufacturers in china 
areas of management focus and performance indicators we focus on the needs of our customers  developing and sourcing new and innovative products  fostering close relationships with manufacturers  and expanding our business in our current markets and entering into new 
table of contents geographic markets  all while maintaining close attention to operational efficiencies and costs 
we are particularly focused on increasing sales volumes of higher margin proprietary products in a cost effective manner to enable us to return to profitability  as well as monitoring and managing levels of accounts receivable and inventory to minimize risk 
performance indicators that are important for the monitoring and management of our business include top line sales growth  cost of sales and gross margin percentage  operating expenses in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues and operating and net income loss 
we rely upon our in house software management system to exercise real time control over many elements of our business including customer relationship management  purchasing  inventory management and control  sales order control and pricing management 
management and employees spend a significant amount of time traveling to latin america and asia pacific with the purpose of spending time with our key customers  suppliers  our beijing design team and other contractors and employees 
we believe that these relationships are vital to our success and we will continue to dedicate a significant amount of time to this area 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that  in management s view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the condition and results that we report in our financial statements 
these critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates and assumptions that require the most significant judgment are discussed further below 
revenue recognition and allowance for returns revenues for wireless handset and accessory sales are recognized when i shipment of the products to customers has occurred and title has passed  ii when collection of the outstanding receivables is probable and iii the final price of the products is determined  which occurs at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  cooperative marketing arrangements  returns and allowances 
on select sales  we may agree to cooperative arrangements wherein we agree to fund future marketing programs related to the products purchased by the customer 
such arrangements are usually agreed to in advance 
the amount of the co op allowance is recorded as a reduction of the sale and added to accrued expenses as a current liability 
subsequent expenditures made pursuant to the arrangements reduce this liability 
to the extent we incur costs in excess of the established cooperative fund  we recognize the amount as a selling or marketing expense 
as part of the sales process  we may perform certain value added services such as programming  software loading and quality assurance testing 
these value added services are considered an ancillary component of the sales process and amounts attributable to these processes are included in the unit cost to the customer 
furthermore  these value added services are related to services prior to the shipment of the products  and no value added services are provided after delivery of the products 
we recognize as a reserve against the related receivables estimates for product returns based on historical experience and other judgmental factors  evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and adjust our estimates each period based on actual product return activity 
we recognize freight costs billed to our customers in sales and actual freight costs incurred as a component of cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for the possible inability to collect accounts receivable by recording an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due in order to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be 
table of contents collected  after consideration for accounts receivable insurance coverage we may have 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
inventory reserves we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand and expected pricing 
we attempt to tightly control our inventory levels and in the recent past have moved more to a build to order model 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with our contract manufacturers with a lead time of to days  and because we may not have a confirmed customer purchase order in hand as quickly as we would like to  we sometimes take inventory risk 
as our products get closer to end of life status  we are more strict about our build to order policy in order to limit our inventory exposure on older product 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development operating loss from continuing operations other income expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net loss we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods reported in our consolidated audited financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   our net sales of million decreased by million  or  compared to net sales of million in the significant decrease in our distribution business from to was almost entirely offset by the increase in sales of our branded verykool products 
our samsung distribution business ended march  as a consequence of a stiff import tariff on certain electronic devices  including wireless handsets  that was enacted in argentina in november and an additional import regulation which became effective in march these protective import actions began to negatively affect our sales beginning in the first quarter of  accelerated through and continued through the end of in  
table of contents our samsung distribution sales declined by million  or  to million from million in nearly offsetting this decline was an increase in sales of our branded verykool products of million  or  to million from million in this represented a record year for sales of verykool products  both in terms of dollar value and units sold 
cost of sales  gross profit and gross margin for the year ended december  increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit gross margin for the year ended december   cost of sales was million  of net sales  and gross margin was  compared to cost of sales of million  of net sales  and a gross margin for the year ended december  in  our gross profit amounted to million  an increase of from million in the significant improvements in both our gross profit and our gross margin percentage are primarily a result of the shift in the mix of sales to a lower concentration of distribution sales and a higher concentration of branded sales incident to the expiration of our distribution agreement with samsung 
sales of our verykool branded products typically result in higher gross margins than our distribution sales 
in  distribution sales comprised of total revenues  with represented by branded sales 
in  distribution sales fell to of total revenues  with coming from sales of branded verykool products 
operating expenses and operating loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   operating expenses of million increased by million  or  from million in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million and r d spending increased by million 
the increased sg a expenses include increases in the following areas personnel additions in the sales  logistics and service departments  sales commissions on increased sales of verykool branded products  marketing  homologation and an isolated bad debt recorded in the first quarter of the increased r d expenses are primarily the result of increased headcount during the second half of to enable the contemporaneous development of a number of new smartphone models 
in december  as these developments drew to a close  we finalized a plan to eliminate the headcount redundancies in the first quarter of and restructure our china workforce 
severance costs for the terminated employees of  were recorded in the fourth quarter of and are also included in r d expense for the year 
for the year ended december   we sustained an operating loss from continuing operations of million  equal to the operating loss of million for the year ended december  the million increase in gross profit in was offset by the million increase in operating expenses 
we expect that the restructuring in china noted above will result in an annual savings of  per year once it is completed in the first quarter of interest expense and other income during the year ended december   other income expense included  of expense comprised of  of foreign exchange losses and a  loss on disposal of fixed assets 
we also recorded  of interest income primarily related to financed customer receivables 
in we had  of other income  consisting primarily of gain on sale of fixed assets  and  of interest income on a tax refund 

table of contents net loss because other income expense in both and were minimal  our net losses in both years were substantially equivalent to the losses from continuing operations for the respective years 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   our net sales of million decreased by million  or  compared to net sales of million in the significant decline was primarily the continued effect of a stiff import tariff on certain electronic devices  including wireless handsets  that was enacted in argentina in november and an additional import regulation which became effective in march these protective import actions began to negatively affect our sales beginning in the first quarter of  accelerated through and continued through the end of in  our samsung distribution sales declined by million  or  to million from million in partially offsetting this decline was an increase in sales of our branded verykool products of million  or  to million from million in cost of sales  gross profit and gross margin for the year ended december  increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit gross margin for the year ended december   cost of sales was million  of net sales  and gross margin was  compared to cost of sales of million  of net sales  and a gross margin for the year ended december  in  our gross profit amounted to million  a decrease of from million in the dramatic improvement in our gross margin is largely a result of the shift in the mix of sales to a lower concentration of distribution sales and a higher concentration of branded sales 
sales of our verykool branded products typically result in higher gross margins than our distribution sales 
in  distribution sales comprised of total revenues  with only represented by branded sales 
in  distribution sales fell to of total revenues  with coming from branded sales 
operating expenses and operating loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   operating expenses of million decreased by million  or  from million in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses declined by million  but this reduction was partially offset by an increase in r d spending of million related to our new development team in beijing that was established in april to focus on our verykool products 
the majority of the sg a decrease was related to reduction of expenses that were variable with sales volume  which decreased in compared to although we made reductions in other expenses as well  such reductions were not proportionate to the decline in sales 
we significantly reduced marketing and legal expenses in compared to and reduced occupancy expenses through the closure of our miami distribution center in march as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses increased to in compared to in  primarily due to the reasons outlined above 
for the year ended december   we sustained an operating loss from continuing operations of million compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  the reduction in the operating loss in was achieved despite a reduction in net sales 
we generated slightly less gross profit  more than doubled our gross profit margin percentage and reduced operating expenses 

table of contents interest expense and other income during the year ended december   we had no bank borrowings and consequently no interest expense 
interest expense in of  related to borrowings under our bank revolving line of credit in the first half of the year 
the line of credit was terminated on september  in we had  of interest income on a tax refund and  of other income consisting primarily of gain on sale of fixed assets 
loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   we sustained a loss from continuing operations of million compared to a loss of million in the loss from continuing operations benefited from a tax refund of  from the carry back of net operating losses in and to prior years 
income loss from discontinued operations during the second quarter of  we assessed opportunities in the united states and mexico and decided to implement actions necessary to close sales operations in both of those countries  which we substantially completed in the second half of  although we generated  in income from discontinued operations during from the salvage sale of remaining inventories 
the discontinuation was completed in without any further income or loss 
net loss because the results of discontinued operations in both and were minimal  our net losses in both years were substantially equivalent to the losses from continuing operations for the respective years 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have used cash from our sale of products and lines of credit bank and vendor to provide the capital needed to support our business 
in late we added a new foreign exchange fx hedging facility with our bank as a tool to hedge our exposure to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
we electively terminated this facility in the first quarter of and the restricted cash supporting it was returned to our general cash reserves 
the primary drivers affecting our cash and liquidity are net income losses and working capital requirements 
capital equipment is not significant in our business  and at december  we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
our largest working capital requirement is for accounts receivable  and  to a lesser extent  inventory  as we strive to minimize our inventory levels 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard credit quality and payment terms ranging between net and net days 
if our net revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could further increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant them extended payment terms 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and million of working capital compared to million of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and million of working capital as of december  as of december  and  we had no bank debt 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on hand and in bank accounts 
operating activities net cash used by operating activities for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million of cash provided by operations for the year ended december  although the net 
table of contents loss of million in was equal to the million loss in  our business contracted significantly in compared to and the reduction in receivables in was the largest factor in the stabilization of cash that year 
in  we used million of cash to fund our net working capital requirements 
this included a million increase in trade accounts receivable  reflecting a larger share of our fourth quarter sales to carrier customers who traditionally pay slower on purchases they make during the holiday season 
days sales outstanding in receivables at december  was days  which was significantly greater than the days at december  we also used million to increase our inventory levels  although this was partially offset by a million reduction in prepaid inventories 
an additional million was used to reduce payables and accruals and million for other assets 
in  we generated million of positive cash flow from a reduction in net working capital 
this consisted primarily of a million reduction in trade accounts receivable  reflecting the drop in annual revenue for the year  and million from a reduction in other receivables 
days sales outstanding in receivables at december  was days  which was a significant improvement over days at december  partially offsetting the reduction in receivables was an increase in inventories and prepaids of million and a net reduction in payables and accruals of million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in both years included investment in tooling and molds for our proprietary verykool products 
in  we also invested million in a restricted cash account to secure our obligations under a new fx hedging facility with our bank 
financing activities there were no financing activities in the years ended december  and net cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  of million represented the complete retirement of outstanding balances under our then existing revolving credit facility 
pursuant to that bank facility  we could borrow up to million based on a borrowing base of our accounts receivable and inventories 
the credit facility was secured by all our assets 
on july   although we had no outstanding borrowings at the time and were in compliance with all of our covenants under the credit facility  we received a notice from the lender of its election to terminate the credit facility on september   the end of the day notice period 
it is our belief that the principal reasons for the lender s actions were the decreased utilization of the facility by us  the high level of capital reserves required by the lender to support the facility and our lack of profitability 
based on our current outlook for our business  we believe that our current cash resources and working capital are sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
however  our cash and working capital needs could change significantly if our business grows rapidly or losses continue 
the lack of a line of credit could inhibit our growth 
for this reason  we continue evaluating potential lines of credit or alternate financing vehicles 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations we lease corporate and administrative office facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
rent expense under these leases was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding related to any debt obligations 

table of contents the following is a schedule of aggregate future minimum rental payments required by the above leases in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for us refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rates at december   we had no outstanding interest bearing debt and no rate sensitive investments 
foreign exchange and other risks at december  and  foreign currency cash accounts in mexican pesos amounted to  and  respectively 
also at december   accounts receivable denominated in mexican pesos amounted to  prior to december  all of our sales transactions were denominated in us dollars 
beginning in december  we began to price sales in foreign currencies only to certain customers in mexico 
product costs  and the majority of our operating expenses are also denominated in us dollars  but payroll and other costs of our beijing development team are denominated in chinese yuan renminbi 
foreign currency risks are associated with our cash  receivables  payroll and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities  which are included in other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december  we had a single foreign currency forward contract in the amount of  there were no forward contracts outstanding at december  as a result of our international sales  our future operating results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures  particularly china 
our market risk management includes an accounts receivable insurance policy for our foreign sales  as well as any domestic sales 
however  there can be no assurance that our insurance policy will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  economic or regulatory conditions on its results of operations and financial position 
we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations had a material impact on our financial results during  or
