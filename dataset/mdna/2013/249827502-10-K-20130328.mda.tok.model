income taxes we recognized a  income tax benefit in consisting of a  net deferred income tax benefit and a  current foreign income tax expense 
the net deferred income tax benefit primarily consisted of a u 
s deferred tax benefit of  associated with the reduction in the company s us valuation allowance 
the reduction in the company s valuation allowance reflects the impact of the deferred tax asset and liability recognition related to the non deductible identified intangible assets acquired in the medefficiency acquisition 
in a  income tax provision was recorded consisting of a  current foreign tax benefit and a  deferred tax provision consisting of a  deferred tax provision related to the amortization of goodwill for tax and not financial reporting purposes  partially offset by a  foreign tax benefit based on our canadian subsidiary s operating results 
due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to use our us and us net operating loss carry forwards and net deferred tax assets  a full valuation allowance for the us and us net deferred tax assets has been provided 
net loss we generated a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted  in compared to a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted  in liquidity and capital resources cash flow and working capital at december  and december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
the  increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects net cash provided by financing activities of  partially offset by cash used in investing activities of  and operating activities of  together with the exchange rate effect of net cash provided by financing activities of  reflects  in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by  of cash used for the payment of minimum payroll withholding taxes 
the net proceeds from issuance of common stock consists of  from the sale of common stock in april and december in connection with raising funds principally for the further development of dsc and  from the exercise of warrants and stock options 
net cash used in operating activities of  resulted from  cash used in operations net loss plus non cash items together with  cash used from the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
higher receivables  inventory  prepaid expenses and lower accounts payable offset by higher accrued liabilities were the main drivers behind the net cash used in connection with the net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in receivables reflects a higher level of current sales 
the increase in inventory reflects a build up to support new products  growth of the international business and improved customer service levels in certain segments of our business 
the increase in prepaid expenses reflected initial advance fee payments on phase clinical trial preparations and timing of other operating expenditure payments 
the decrease in accounts payable reflected payment timing while the increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities principally reflected higher accrued bonus compensation and related taxes and an increase in the canadian sales net rebate due to timing 
net cash used in investing activities of  included  net cash used to complete the medefficiency acquisition   used to acquire the bioguard worldwide rights and revise the qmt technology license agreement together with a  medihoney sales milestone payment for reaching the  annual sales level and  used for capital expenditures partially offset by net proceeds of  from the sale of investments and  from the sale of equipment 
the majority of the capital expenditures are being made to upgrade and expand our manufacturing capabilities and purchase computer equipment for the expanded sales force 
working capital increased  at december  to  from  at december  this increase principally reflects the proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock in  partially offset by the funds used to acquire medefficiency 
management believes that this level of working capital is sufficient to support our existing operations for the next twelve months 
prospective assessment our strategic objective is to build the company by both continuing to progress dsc  with an initial indication of the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers  as well as in licensing  developing and launching novel higher margin advanced wound care products while utilizing our cash on hand and cash flow provided by our traditional wound care business to the extent possible to fund this objective 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate external opportunities as evidenced by our acquisition of medefficiency and the patent and technology license with qmt to leverage our core capabilities for growth  and will consider initiating additional development programs on new indications for dsc to the extent we determine that we cannot finance our growth initiatives internally  additional sources of funding may be available to us through the sale of equity  the sale of licensing rights to dsc  jointly developing products with third parties and or selling a portion of our existing business 
the launch of a number of new products in recent years and the acquisition of the medefficiency line of tcc products in april bodes well for the future growth of our higher margined advanced wound care products both domestically and abroad 
we continue to work on our pipeline and have identified several product line extensions and new products that are capable of contributing to future sales growth 
traditional wound care sales are expected to remain relatively stable 
our strategy for growth is assuming the existing resources in place are generating the expected return  we will continue to expand our worldwide investment in sales and marketing resources in support of our higher margined advanced wound care products 
in  we continued to expand our sales and marketing resources in support of our advanced wound care growth initiatives 
in addition  we acquired the medefficiency business in april and the worldwide license rights to bioguard in july 
additional sales representatives will continue to be added as needed to support the continued growth of segments of our business 
we have established a presence in europe through a direct sales organization in the uk and through distributors in a number of other countries  as well as a presence in australia  new zealand  south korea  and various countries throughout latin america and the middle east through distributors 
we plan to expand our sales and marketing in this and other areas of the world employing a direct sales force or distributor model as the basis for conducting business  as circumstances dictate 
while the potential commercial launch of dsc is estimated to be three years away pending the acceptance of an nda by the fda  we believe the market potential of this product for diabetic foot ulcers and other indications that we have the rights to are significant 
in february and may  we reported positive top line results for our dsc phase clinical trial 
in october   we met with the fda for our end of phase meeting which included discussion of our phase clinical trial design 
during the fourth quarter of we submitted our protocols for the phase clinical trial program to the fda 
our toxicology and cmc programs are proceeding as planned 
we produced the first clinical drug product during the fourth quarter of and initiated the first of two clinical trials during the first quarter the second clinical trial is anticipated to commence during the second quarter of the cost of the preparation and execution of the phase program is presently estimated to be approximately to million 
this includes the costs for the clinical  manufacturing and the toxicology nonclinical programs 
beyond the initial indication of the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers  we are also planning pre clinical activities for scar prevention  and anticipate having initial data sometime within to help determine whether or not to progress towards an ind application 
we will continue to nurture our traditional wound care business in an effort to sustain it and grow it where possible  utilizing the appropriate amount of human and financial resources to achieve our objectives 
while this area of our business presently represents a significant albeit diminishing percentage of our sales and realizes lower gross profit margins  it generates positive cash flow as it does not require extensive sales and marketing resources to sustain it 
maintenance and growth of this business is important to us as we utilize this cash flow to help support our advanced wound care and pharmaceutical wound care growth initiatives 
with the planned improvement in operations  expected working capital requirements and cash on hand as of december   we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to meet our existing operating and product development needs for at least the next twelve months 
further  if needed  we believe the continued success of our advanced wound care business and the development of dsc will serve to improve our ability to raise equity or generate capital from the sale of licensing rights going forward to fund prospective growth initiatives 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol dsci 
we have paid no cash dividends in respect of our common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the near future 
additional financial information off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation our management currently believes that inflation has not had  and does not currently have  a material impact on continuing operations 
critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of sales deductions for trade rebates  sales incentives  discounts and allowances 
significant estimates and assumptions are also required in determining the appropriateness of amortization periods for identifiable intangible assets  the potential impairment of goodwill and the valuation of inventory 
some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates 
for any individual estimate or assumption made by us  there may also be other reasonable estimates or assumptions 
we believe  however  that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented 
our most critical accounting policies were discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and are described below 
revenue recognition and adjustments to revenue we sell our products through our own direct sales force and through independent distributors and manufacturers representatives 
the primary end users of our products are nursing homes  hospitals  clinics and home healthcare agencies 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured  which is generally at the time of shipment or receipt by our customers  depending on the terms of the related sales or distribution agreement 
when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  we simultaneously adjust revenue for estimated trade rebates and distribution fees in canada  and estimates of returns and allowances  cash discounts and other sales incentives 
a trade rebate represents the difference between the invoice price to the wholesaler distributor and the end user s contract price 
these rebates are estimated monthly based on historical experience  distributor rebate submission trends  estimated distributor inventory levels  and existing contract sales terms with our distributors and end users 
we have a contract with our exclusive canadian distributor and we pay a fixed fee based on sales subject to the fee as defined for distribution services in canada 
because the services performed by the distributor cannot be separated from the purchase of our products by the distributor  we treat this distribution fee as a reduction of revenue 
the distribution fee is accrued monthly based on net sales to the distributor multiplied by the ratio of recent historical distributor fee expense to net sales 
the percentage of distributor fee expense to net sales is re evaluated quarterly for reasonableness 
sales incentives represent credits granted to specific customers based on attainment of pre determined sales objectives 
sales incentives are accrued monthly in accordance with the terms of the underlying sales incentive agreement and actual customer sales 
sales incentive agreements are generally for a period of one year 
we provide our customers certain limited return rights and we have a formal returned goods policy that guides the disposition of returns with our customers 
we accrue for sales returns and allowances and cash discounts monthly based on current sales and historical activity 
we do not offer our customers price protection rights or concessions 
returns were less than of gross sales in both and we continually monitor the factors that influence rebates and fees  returns and allowances  and other discounts and sales incentives and make adjustments as necessary 
goodwill at december   we had  of goodwill of which  related to the medefficiency acquisition in april   related to the first aid products acquisition in november  and  related to the western medical acquisition in april we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the assessment is performed using the two step process required by accounting guidance relating to goodwill 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
for and  the first step of our goodwill impairment test reflected a fair value in excess of the carrying value of our reporting units 
accordingly  we did not perform the second step of this test during these periods 
the cash generating unit level or reporting unit at which we test goodwill for impairment is the operating segment level 
products are allocated to each segment based on the nature and intended use of the product 
the medefficiency goodwill is allocated to our advanced wound care segment and the first aid products and western medical goodwill to our traditional wound care segment 
for and and consistent with prior periods  we estimated the fair value of our segments using the income approach  where we use a discounted cash flow model dcf in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a segment and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation include i estimates of future revenue and expense growth  ii future estimated effective tax rates  iii future estimated capital expenditures  iv future required investments in working capital  v average cost of capital  and vi the terminal value of the reporting unit 
the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our five year forecast 
beyond our five year forecast we assumed a terminal value to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis 
annual revenue growth rates in our dcf model reflect expected growth in our advanced and traditional wound care products 
the weighted average cost of capital used to discount cash flows for the annual goodwill impairment test was 
there have been no substantial changes to the methodology employed  significant assumptions or calculations applied in the first step of the goodwill impairment test over the past several years 
inventory the company writes down the value of inventory by the estimate of the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value 
the estimate takes into account projected sales of the inventory on hand and the age of the inventory in stock 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the provision for the write down of inventory is recorded in cost of sales 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense associated with stock options and other equity based compensation based on the fair value at the grant date and recognized over the requisite service and performance periods 
we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model for service and performance based awards 
we use the quoted market price for service and performance based restricted share units and binomial lattice option pricing model for market based awards 
significant judgment and the use of estimates to value the equity based compensation  particularly surrounding black scholes or binomial lattice pricing model assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives are made
