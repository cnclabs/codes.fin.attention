in particular  the discussion is intended to provide an analysis of significant trends and material changes in our financial position and the operating results of our business during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   and during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the two year period ended december  and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance 
this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks described throughout this filing  particularly in item a 
risk factors 
stem cells and products for regenerative medicine research we have designated our subsidiary lifemap sciences as our primary internet marketing arm for our research products 
in addition to offering subscriptions to its database products  lifemap sciences is also utilizing its databases as part of its strategy for marketing our research products online to reach life sciences researchers at biotech and pharmaceutical companies and at academic institutions and research hospitals worldwide 
the lifemap discovery data base provides access to available cell related information and resources necessary to improve stem cell research and development of therapeutics based on regenerative medicine and may promote the sale of our purestem hepc by permitting data base users to follow the development of hes cell lines to the purified hepc state 
plasma volume expander products royalties and licensing fees related to our plasma volume expander products  primarily hextend  comprise a significant part of our operating revenues 
hextend has become the standard plasma volume expander at a number of prominent teaching hospitals and leading medical centers and is part of the tactical combat casualty care protocol of the us armed forces 
under our license agreements  hospira and cj will report sales of hextend and pay us the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales after the end of each calendar quarter 
we recognize revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place 

table of contents royalties on sales of hextend that occurred during the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of are reflected in our financial statements for the year ended december  we received  in royalties from hextend sales by hospira during royalties for decreased from  in royalties from hospira on hextend sales in in addition  we received royalties from cj in the amount of  for the period ended december   representing a decrease from  in royalties received for the period ended december  based on sales of hextend that occurred during the fourth quarter of  we received royalties of  from hospira and  from cj during the first quarter of total royalties of  for the quarter decreased from royalties of  received during the same period last year 
these royalties will be reflected in our financial statements for the first quarter of the decrease in royalties is attributable to a decrease in hextend sales in the us and in the republic of korea 
the decrease in royalties received from hospira based on sales during the previous quarter is generally due to the decline in the price of hetastarch based products in the market 
the blood volume expander marketing is shrinking overall and hospitals have shifted their purchases to albumin products 
hospira has reported that they have seen a rapid decline in the price of hetastarch based plasma expanders in the market which could continue to have a negative impact on revenues from the sale of hextend 
hospira implemented further price reductions for hextend during in an attempt to maintain market share 
during the year ended december   we received  from summit for the right to co develop hextend and pentalyte in japan  china  and taiwan 
a portion of the cash payment is a partial reimbursement of biotime s development costs of hextend and a portion is a partial reimbursement of biotime s development costs of pentalyte 
this payment is reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue 
research and development programs in regenerative medicine and stem cell research we entered the fields of stem cell research and regenerative medicine during october from that time through  our activities in those fields included acquiring rights to market stem cell lines  pursuing patents  planning future products and research programs  applying for research grants  identifying the characteristics of various acquired progenitor and stem cell lines  negotiating a product distribution agreement  organizing new subsidiaries to address particular fields of product development  and planning and launching our first product development programs

table of contents the inherent uncertainties of developing new products for stem cell research and for medical use make it impossible to predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to complete the development and commence commercialization of new products 
there is no assurance that we or any of our subsidiaries will be successful in developing new technologies or stem cell products  or that any technology or products that may be developed will be proven safe and effective for treating diseases in humans  or will be successfully commercialized 
most of our potential therapeutic products are at a very early stage of preclinical development 
before any clinical trials can be conducted by us or any of our subsidiaries  the company seeking to conduct the trials would have to compile sufficient laboratory test data substantiating the characteristics and purity of the stem cells  conduct animal studies  and then obtain all necessary regulatory and clinical trial site approvals  after which a team of physicians and statisticians would need to be assembled to perform the trials 
clinical trials will be costly to undertake and will take years to complete

during the year ended december  biotime allocated  and  in general and administrative expenses to esi and cell cure neurosciences  respectively critical accounting policies revenue recognition we comply with sec staff accounting bulletin guidance on revenue recognition 
royalty revenues consist of product royalty payments 
license fee revenues consist of fees under license agreements and are recognized when earned and reasonably estimable and also include subscription and advertising revenue from our online databases based upon respective subscription or advertising periods 
we recognize revenue in the quarter in which the royalty reports are received rather than the quarter in which the sales took place 
when we are entitled to receive up front nonrefundable licensing or similar fees pursuant to agreements under which we have no continuing performance obligations  the fees are recognized as revenues when collection is reasonably assured 
when we receive up front nonrefundable licensing or similar fees pursuant to agreements under which we do have continuing performance obligations  the fees are deferred and amortized ratably over the performance period 
if the performance period cannot be reasonably estimated  we amortize nonrefundable fees over the life of the contract until such time that the performance period can be more reasonably estimated 
milestone payments  if any  related to scientific or technical achievements are recognized in income when the milestone is accomplished if a substantive effort was required to achieve the milestone  b the amount of the milestone payment appears reasonably commensurate with the effort expended  and c collection of the payment is reasonably assured 
grant income and the sale of research products are recognized as revenue when earned 
revenues from the sale of research products are primarily derived from the sale of hydrogels and stem cell products 
patent costs costs associated with obtaining patents on products or technology developed are expensed as general and administrative expenses when incurred 
this accounting is in compliance with guidance promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
research and development we comply with fasb requirements governing accounting for research and development costs 
research and development costs are expensed when incurred  and consist principally of salaries  payroll taxes  consulting fees  research and laboratory fees  and license fees paid to acquire patents or licenses to use patents and other technology from third parties 
stock based compensation we have adopted accounting standards governing share based payments  which require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to directors and employees  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes merton option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury rates in effect during the corresponding period of grant 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with recent fasb guidance  changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value 
in management s opinion  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options because the option pricing model value may not be indicative of the fair value that would be established in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 

table of contents treasury stock we account for biotime common shares issued to subsidiaries for future potential working capital needs as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheet 
we have the intent and ability to register any unregistered shares to support the marketability of the shares 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if an impairment indicator is present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the assets are impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
deferred license and consulting fees deferred license and consulting fees consist of the value of warrants issued to third parties for services and to the minority shareholder in biotime asia for its participation in the organization of that company  and deferred license fees paid to acquire rights to use the proprietary technologies of third parties 
the value of the warrants is being amortized over the lives of the warrants  and deferred license fees over the estimated useful lives of the licensed technologies or licensed research products 
the estimation of the useful life any technology or product involves a significant degree of inherent uncertainty  since the outcome of research and development or the commercial life of a new product cannot be known with certainty at the time that the right to use the technology or product is acquired 
we will review its amortization schedules for impairments that might occur earlier than the original expected useful lives

table of contents under our license agreements with hospira and cj  our licensees report sales of hextend and pay us the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we recognize such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place 
for example  royalties on sales made during the fourth quarter of were not recognized until the first quarter of fiscal year our royalty revenues from product sales for the year ended december  primarily consist of royalties on sales of hextend made by hospira and cj during the period beginning october  and ending september  royalty revenues recognized for that period were  compared with  recognized for the year ended december  this decrease in royalties is attributable to a decrease in hextend sales in the us and in the republic of korea 
the decrease in royalties received from hospira is primarily due to the decline in the price of hetastarch based products in the market 
the blood volume expander marketing continues to contract and hospitals continue to shift their purchases to albumin products 
hospira has reported that they have seen a rapid decline in the price of hetastarch based plasma expanders in the market which could continue to have a negative impact on revenues from the sale of hextend 
hospira implemented further price reductions for hextend during in an attempt to maintain market share

however  on march  we executed an amendment with the investor to accelerate the closing date to april  the funds received from that investor will be earmarked to fund our cash contribution obligation to bac under the asset contribution agreement 
we may lend to bac all or a portion of the  installment that we received to finance bac s operations  and we will be credited with the amount of the loan as part of our  cash contribution to be made to bac under the asset contribution agreement 
we will depend upon revenue from the sale of our research products  database subscription and advertising revenues  royalties from the sale of hextend by hospira and cj  and research grants as our principal sources of revenues for the near future 
our cirm grant  which was our largest source of grant revenues  expired during august and will no longer be a source of cash for our operations 
although we have applied for additional cirm grants  there is no assurance that cirm will approve any future grants for our research and development programs 
because our revenues from product sales  subscription and advertising revenues  and royalties are not presently sufficient to cover our operating expenses  we may need to obtain additional equity capital or debt in order to finance our operations 
the future availability and terms of equity or debt financing are uncertain 
we presently have issued and outstanding  common share purchase warrants   of which are exercisable at a price of per share and will expire in april   of which are exercisable at a price of per share and will expire in may  and  issued in january of which are exercisable at a price of per share and will expire in january none of the warrants are publicly traded 
upon consummation of the asset contribution transaction under the asset contribution agreement  we will issue  common share purchase warrants to bac  and  common share purchase warrants to the private investor under the stock and warrant purchase agreement 
bac will distribute the warrants it receives to the holders of its series a common stock 
those warrants will have an exercise price of per share 
the warrants to be issued to bac will expire in five years from the date of issue  and the warrants to be issued to the private investor will expire in january we expect that the warrants to be issued to bac will be publicly traded 
the unavailability or inadequacy of financing or revenues to meet future capital needs could force us to modify  curtail  delay  or suspend some or all aspects of our planned operations 
sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders 
cash generated by operations during  we received  of cash in our operations 
our sources of that cash were  of royalty revenues from hospira   of royalty revenues from cj   of research grant payment from the nih   from the sale of research products   from subscription and advertisement revenues   in foreign grants  and a  research grant payment from cirm 
cash used in operations during  our total research and development expenditures were  and our general and administrative expenditures were  net loss attributable to biotime for the year ended december  amounted to  net cash used in operating activities during this period amounted to  the difference between the net loss and net cash used in operating activities during was primarily attributable to amortization of  in intangible assets   in stock based compensation paid to employees and consultants   in options issued as independent director compensation   amortization of deferred consulting fees   amortization of deferred license fees   in depreciation expense   in accounts receivable   in deferred revenues   in reduction in receivables from the reversal of revenues  and  in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
this overall difference was offset to some extent by amortization of  in deferred license  royalty and subscription revenues   in amortization of deferred grant income   in grants receivable   in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and net loss of  allocable to the noncontrolling interest in our subsidiaries 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities during the year ended december    was used for investing activities 
the primary components of this cash were approximately  used in the purchase of equipment offset to some extent by  of cash acquired in connection with the merger with xennex and  proceeds from the sale of equipment 
cash generated by financing activities during the year ended december    in net cash was provided from our financing activities 
during this period  we received  in connection with the exercise of  options   from issuance of lifemap sciences common shares   from the sale of biotime common stock and  from the sale of treasury shares held by a subsidiary 
this overall difference is offset by  in financing fees incurred as part of the sale of biotime common stock 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter were as follows principal payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases this table does not include payments to key employees that could arise if they were involuntary terminated or if their employment terminated following a change in control 
includes the lease of our principal office and laboratory facilities in alameda  california  and leases of the offices and laboratory facilities of our subsidiaries biotime acquisition corporation  esi  lifemap sciences  and cell cure neurosciences 
recent financing activities during april and may  lifemap sciences sold to us  shares of common stock for  in cash 
in july and in december  lifemap sciences sold  shares of common stock to certain private investors who are also biotime shareholders for  cash and  biotime common shares having a market value of  some of these biotime shares held by lifemap sciences were sold during the year and the remaining  biotime common shares along with the  held by oncocyte are accounted for as treasury stock as of december  from october  through march   we sold a total of  common shares and received gross proceeds of  through the controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor and through the sale of biotime common shares held by our majority owned subsidiaries  lifemap sciences and cell cure neurosciences 
the proceeds of the sale of biotime shares by lifemap sciences and cell cure neurosciences belong to those subsidaries 
there is no assurance that we will be able to sell additional common shares through the controlled equity offering facility at prices acceptable to us  but we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  including the proceeds from the sales of common shares from the controlled equity offering  should be sufficient to fund our operations through at least into the first quarter of during january  we received an additional  in cash from a private investor as the first installment of a sale of common shares and warrants under a stock and warrant purchase agreement 

table of contents future capital needs we currently depend upon revenue from the sale of our stem cell research products  subscriptions and advertising from lifemap sciences database products  sales of hystem hydrogel for research use  royalties from the sale of hextend by hospira and cj  and research grants 
any significant loss in any of these revenue sources could impact our future capital needs 
our product sales and royalty revenues may be supplemented by any license fees that we may receive if we enter into new commercial license agreements for our products or technology 
the amount and pace of research and development work that we can do or sponsor  and our ability to commence and complete the clinical trials that are required in order for us to obtain fda and foreign regulatory approval of products  depend upon the amount of money we have 
we curtailed the pace and scope of our plasma volume expander development efforts due to the limited amount of funds available 
future research and clinical study costs are not presently determinable due to many factors  including the inherent uncertainty of these costs and the uncertainty as to timing  source  and amount of capital that will become available for our projects 
the market value and the volatility of our stock price  as well as general market conditions  could impact our ability to raise capital on favorable terms  or at all 
any equity financing we obtain may further dilute or otherwise impair the ownership interests of our current shareholders 
if we fail to generate positive cash flows or fail to obtain additional capital when required  we could modify  delay or abandon some or all of our programs 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to some foreign exchange currency risks because we have subsidiaries that are located in foreign countries 
we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations have an impact on our financial results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is mitigated by the fact that our foreign subsidiaries pay their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currency 
as of december   currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our intercompany transactions with our foreign subsidiaries 
however  a weakening of the dollar against the foreign exchange used in the home countries of our foreign subsidiaries could increase our cost of providing additional financing to our foreign subsidiaries in the future 
conversely  a strengthening of the dollar would decrease our cost of making additional investments in those subsidiaries 
credit risk we place most of our cash in united states banks and we invest some of our cash in interest bearing instruments issued by united states banks or the united states treasury 
deposits with banks may temporarily exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
we monitor the cash balances in our accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  but if the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the federally insured amount at a bank  the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost  in whole or in part  if the bank were to fail 
our foreign subsidiaries deposit their cash in local banks  but if the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the amount at a bank under the national banking insurance laws  the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost  in whole or in part  if the bank were to fail 
interest rate risk we invest a portion of our cash in interest bearing securities issued by the united states treasury 
the primary objective of our investments is to preserve principal and liquidity while earning a return on our invested capital  without incurring significant risks 
the market value of fixed rate instruments will decline if interest rates rise 
due in part to this factor  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates
