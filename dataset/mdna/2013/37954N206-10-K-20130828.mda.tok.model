introduction we are one of the leading manufacturers of silicon metal and silicon based alloys 
as of june   we owned and operated seven principal manufacturing facilities  in two primary operating segments gmi  our north american operations and  globe metales  our argentine operations 
business segments we operate in six reportable segments gmi a manufacturer of silicon metal and silicon based alloys located in north america with plants in beverly  ohio  alloy  west virginia  niagara falls  new york  selma  alabama  bridgeport  alabama and b cancour  quebec and a provider of specialty metallurgical coal for the silicon metal and silicon based alloys industries located in corbin  kentucky  globe metais a distributor of silicon metal manufactured in brazil 
this segment includes the historical brazilian manufacturing operations  comprised of a manufacturing plant in breu branco and mining operations and forest reserves  which were all sold on november  subsequent to this divestiture  globe metais net sales relate only to the fulfillment of certain retained customer contracts  which were completed as of december   globe metales a manufacturer of silicon based alloys located in argentina with a silicon based alloys plant in mendoza and a cored wire fabrication facility in san luis  solsil a developer and manufacturer of upgraded metallurgical grade silicon metal located in the united states with operations in beverly  ohio  corporate a corporate office including general expenses  investments  and related investment income  and other includes an electrode production operation in china yonvey and a cored wire production facility located in poland 
these operations do not fit into the above reportable segments  and are immaterial for purposes of separate disclosure 
overview and recent developments customer demand has stabilized for silicon metal and silicon based alloys as our major end markets which include chemical  aluminum  automotive  steel and solar are showing some signs of improvement  though our global end markets remained weaker in fiscal year compared to fiscal year while demand has stabilized  we have faced a tougher pricing environment 
as a result  our average selling prices decreased for both silicon metal and silicon based alloys 
our annual calendar year silicon metal contracts were renewed for at prices lower than the prior year 
approximately of these contracts are index based  so our pricing decline was due to both lower priced contracts and lower indices 
on the silicon based alloys side  we faced reduced pricing and sales of ferrosilicon due to the aggressive pricing of imports  primarily from russia and venezuela 
on may   we exercised our right to lockout the unionized employees at the becancour  canada plant 
at the time of the lockout  the plant shut down two of the three furnaces 
currently  management representatives of the plant operate the remaining furnace 
the lockout costs the company approximately million per month in operating income 
we currently cannot anticipate when we will have a negotiated resolution to the lockout 
on august  the company closed on a new five year   revolving credit facility to replace its previous facility 
key modifications relative to the new agreement include a reduction of the borrowing rate by basis points  simplified covenants including  among others  a maximum total net debt to earnings before income tax  depreciation and amortization ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the new facility also provides expanded flexibility to make strategic capital investments  acquisitions  divestitures and fund returns to shareholders 
net sales for the fourth quarter decreased  or from the immediately preceding quarter as a result of a decrease in tons shipped at a decrease in pricing 
a majority of the volume decline was due to the lockout at our becancour  canada facility 
additionally  we faced softer demand from some of our silicon metal end markets 
during the fourth quarter  we incurred  of transaction related due diligence expenses and approximately  in costs and lost profitability related to the becancour lockout 
during the fourth quarter  we had fewer maintenance outages than the third quarter and were able to realize the benefits of these outages 
as a result  our cost of production decreased by approximately  million  excluding our becancour  canada plant 
additionally  alden resources had a higher contribution margin related to higher production resulting in  increased profitability from the third quarter 
these improvements significantly offset the lower pricing and volumes 
outlook customer demand for silicon metal in the united states has stabilized 
however  europe and south america remain weak  resulting in continued modest supply and demand imbalances 
we have entered into contracts to sell approximately of our silicon metal capacity for the remainder of calendar approximately of those contracts are index based containing monthly or quarterly adjustments tied to those indices 
as our average selling price continues to indicate  the current average price of our total book of fixed price contracts and index based contracts is higher than the current spot index 
the actual price we realized on the silicon metal sales during the remainder of calendar will vary based on the mix of customer contracts and movements in spot prices and the indices 
we are pleased to see the improvement in operational efficiency following the completion of the planned maintenance outages in the third quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we anticipate lower cost related to maintenance and furnace downtime 
additionally  we continue to look at all areas of the company and will take strong measures to further improve the cost structure across the company 
our alden coal business continues to meet expectations  despite a temporary scale back in operations to work down excess inventory 
a favorable outcome from the initiation of a canadian anti dumping and countervailing duties action against imports of silicon metal from china may have a positive impact on the supply demand balance in north america 
we have also filed a trade petition to address the unfair trade flow of ferrosilicon from russia and venezuela into the united states 
we expect a final resolution of this trade petition in the first quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  known or expected trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
inventories cost of inventories is determined by the first in  first out method or  in certain cases  by the average cost method 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
circumstances may arise eg  reductions in market pricing  obsolete  slow moving or defective inventory that require the carrying amount of our inventory to be written down to net realizable value 
we estimate market and net realizable value based on current and future expected selling prices  as well as expected costs to complete  including utilization of parts and supplies in our manufacturing process 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  future market price decreases caused by changing economic conditions  customer demand  or other factors  could result in future inventory write downs that could be material 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment test is necessary  including among other things  a significant or prolonged deterioration in operating results and projected cash flows  significant changes in the extent or manner in which assets are used  technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete  our strategy and capital planning  and the economic climate in the markets we serve 
when estimating future cash flows and if necessary  fair value  we make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets 
we consider historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  the impact of planned business and operational strategies and other information available at the time the estimates are made 
we believe these estimates are reasonable  however  changes in circumstances or conditions could have a significant impact on our estimates  which might result in material impairment charges in the future 
in recent years  solsil has focused on research and development projects and has not produced material for commercial sale 
although we expected to expand operations through the construction of new facilities using new technologies  falling market prices of polysilicon make further research and development pursuits not commercially viable for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized an impairment charge of  within the solsil segment to write off equipment related to solsil as a result of its decision to indefinitely take these assets out of service 
in  the company acquired exploration licenses related to certain properties located in nigeria  which granted it the right to explore for  among other things  manganese ore  a raw material used in the production of certain silicon and manganese based alloys 
during the fiscal year ended june   based upon difficulties encountered in gaining secure access to properties  the company determined that exploration of these properties is not feasible and has decided to abandon its plan to conduct exploration activities 
accordingly  the company recognized an impairment charge of  within the corporate segment representing the aggregate carrying amount of the licenses 
as of june   the carrying value of the property  plant and equipment at yonvey of approximately  is expected to be recovered by the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset group 
yonvey is currently testing new raw materials for use in new production methods 
deterioration in overall market conditions  or our inability to execute cost rationalization initiatives through development of new production methods or other means  could have a negative effect on these assumptions  and might result in an impairment of yonvey s long lived assets in the future 
income taxes the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if management determines it is more likely than not that a portion of the company s deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the provision for income taxes is based on domestic including federal and state and international statutory income tax rates in the tax jurisdictions where the company operates  permanent differences between financial reporting and tax reporting  and available credits and incentives 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions 
the company may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authorities  and positions taken may not be sustained 
all  or a portion of  the benefit of income tax positions are recognized only when the company has made a determination that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position 
for tax positions that are determined as more likely than not to be sustained  the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the accounting for uncertain income tax positions requires consideration of timing and judgments about tax issues and potential outcomes  and is a subjective estimate 
in certain circumstances  the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties 
if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates  they could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense 
the us government is the company s most significant income tax jurisdiction 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price of acquired businesses over fair values attributed to underlying net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets 
we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level which for the company is represented by each reported segment and core metals a component of gmi that produces silicon based alloys  using a two step approach  annually as of the last day of february  or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  this is an indicator that the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit may be impaired 
in this case  a second step is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had just been acquired in a business combination  and as if the purchase price was equivalent to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss for that excess 
the valuation of the company s reporting units requires significant judgment in evaluation of  among other things  recent indicators of market activity and estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
the estimates of cash flows  future earnings  and discount rate are subject to change due to the economic environment and business trends  including such factors as raw material and product pricing  interest rates  expected market returns and volatility of markets served  as well as our future manufacturing capabilities  government regulation and technological change 
we believe that the estimates of future cash flows  future earnings  and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates  circumstances or conditions could have a significant impact on our fair valuation estimation  which could then result in an impairment charge in the future 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized an impairment charge of  goodwill balance of  before adjustments for foreign exchange rate changes  within the other segment to write off goodwill associated with our electrode business in china yonvey as a result of delays in the company s ability to develop a new production method that caused us to revise its expected future cash flows 
in estimating the fair value of yonvey  we considered cash flow projections using assumptions about  among other things  overall market conditions and successful cost rationalization initiatives principally through the development of new production methods that will enable sustainable quality and pricing 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized an impairment charge of  related to the partial impairment of goodwill at our silicon based alloy business in argentina metales resulting from sustained sales price declines that caused us to revise our expected future cash flows 
the impairment charge is recorded within the metales segment 
fair value was estimated based on discounted cash flows and market multiples 
as of june   the fair value of the metales reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 
the remaining goodwill is  as of june  the estimated fair value of each of our remaining reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts as of the measurement date in fiscal share based compensation during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized share based compensation expense of  share based payments are measured based on fair value using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price as well as other assumptions  including i estimated volatility over the term of the awards which is based upon the historical volatility of our common stock or stock of similar companies  ii estimated period of time that we expect participants to hold their stock options  which is calculated using the simplified method allowed by sab  or a participant specific estimate for certain options  iii the risk free interest rate which we base upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the award  and iv our expected dividend yield 
certain of our share based payment arrangements are liability classified  which require adjustments to the fair value of the award and compensation expense based  in part  on the fair value of our stock and the assumptions above at the end of each reporting period 
further  we estimate forfeitures for the purposes of expensing share based payment awards that we ultimately expect to vest 
the future value of our stock  the assumptions above  and changes to our estimated forfeitures could significantly impact the amount of share based compensation expense we recognize in future periods 
results of operations our results of operations are affected by our recent acquisitions and divestitures 
we acquired alden resources and quebec silicon on july  and june   respectively 
results from alden resources for the years ended june  and june  include results for the entire period and approximately eleven months  respectively 
results from quebec silicon for the years ended june  and june  include results for the entire period and approximately seventeen days 
additionally  we sold the manufacturing operations of globe metais in november  but continued to sell a portion of the silicon metal produced by globe metais to fulfill commitments to customers of globe metais that we retained until december  gsm fiscal year ended june  vs

the increase in sales volume was driven by a increase in silicon metal tons sold and a increase in silicon based alloys tons sold  resulting in an increase of  the increase in silicon metal volume was due to the acquisition of quebec silicon on june  which contributed  tons during fiscal year  partially offset by a decrease from our beverly  ohio facility due to the conversion of a silicon furnace to a ferrosilicon furnace 
the slight increase in silicon based alloys was primarily due to increased demand from the steel and automotive industries in north america 
the average selling price of silicon metal decreased by and the average selling price of silicon based alloys decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in silicon metal pricing was due to lower pricing on calendar and contracts  including lower pricing on index based contracts  and the effect of selling of the silicon volume from the becancour  quebec plant joint venture at cost plus a modest margin 
the decrease in silicon based alloys pricing was due to weaker pricing in the marketplace driven by import competition and end user demand  particularly in europe 
other revenue increased  due to an increase in third party coal sales from alden resources 
the acquisition of quebec silicon and the step acquisition of a interest in an existing equity investment  both resulted in an increase in silica fume sales 
cost of goods sold the  or increase in cost of goods sold was a result of a increase in metric tons sold and a increase in cost per ton sold 
the increase in cost per ton sold is primarily due to the impact of planned major maintenance performed on several of our furnaces during fiscal  including a day outage on our largest furnace in alloy  west virginia  a day outage on a furnace at our niagara falls  new york facility  and a day outage on one of our two furnaces at our argentine facility 
additionally  the acquisition of quebec silicon increased the mix of silicon metal sales  which has a higher production cost than silicon based alloys  resulted in increased cost per ton sold 
cost of goods sold further increased from a write down of  for certain of solsil s inventories to expected net realizable values 
the increases in cost of goods sold were partially offset by costs associated with the fire at our bridgeport  alabama ferrosilicon facility in the previous year 
gross margin represented approximately of net sales in fiscal  a decrease from of net sales in the previous year 
this decrease was a result of lower silicon metal and silicon based alloy selling prices  a higher cost per ton sold and the write down of inventories 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  or was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately  of which  represents the remeasurement cost resulting from the change in the classification of the outstanding options from equity awards to liability awards and vesting of outstanding liability classified option awards 
in addition  the acquisition of quebec silicon increased expenses of  in the current year 
this was offset by a reduction in variable based compensation of  and a reduction of due diligence and transaction expenses of  business interruption insurance recovery during fiscal year  we recognized business interruption proceeds of  of which  was related to the fire at our bridgeport  alabama facility in the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  we recognized business interruption proceeds of  goodwill impairment during fiscal year  we recognized an impairment of goodwill of approximately  during the year  we recognized an impairment charge to write off goodwill associated with our electrode business in china yonvey as a result of delays in our ability to develop a new production method that caused us to revise our expected future cash flows 
in estimating the fair value of yonvey  we considered cash flow projections using assumptions about  among other things  overall market conditions and successful cost rationalization initiatives principally through the development of new production methods that will enable sustainable quality and pricing 
we made a downward revision in the forecasted cash flows from our yonvey reporting unit which resulted in an impairment of the entire goodwill balance of approximately  impairment charge of  net of adjustments for foreign exchange rate changes 
the impairment charge is recorded within the other reporting segment 
as of june   the carrying value of the property  plant and equipment at yonvey is expected to be recovered by the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset group 
yonvey is currently testing new raw materials for use in new production methods 
deterioration in overall market conditions or our inability to execute our cost rationalization initiatives through development of new production methods or other means could have a negative effect on these assumptions  and might result in an impairment of yonvey s long lived assets in the future 
during the year ended june   in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test  we recognized an impairment charge of  related to the partial impairment of goodwill at our silicon based alloy business in argentina metales resulting from sustained sales price declines that caused us to revise our expected future cash flows 
the impairment charge is recorded within the metales reporting segment 
fair value was estimated based on discounted cash flows and market multiples 
estimates under our discounted income based approach involve numerous variables including anticipated sales price and volumes  cost structure  discount rates and long term growth that are subject to change as business conditions change  and therefore could impact fair values in the future 
as of june   the fair value of metales reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by less than 
the remaining goodwill is  as of june  impairment of long lived assets during fiscal year  we recognized an impairment of long lived assets of approximately  in recent years  solsil has been focused on research and development projects and was not producing material for commercial sale 
although we expected to expand operations through the construction of new facilities using new technologies  the falling prices of polysilicon make further research and development pursuits commercially not viable 
during the quarter ended march   we recognized an impairment charge of  to write off equipment related to solsil as a result of our decision to take these assets out of service which was done  in response to sustained pricing declines that have rendered our production methods uneconomical 
the amount of the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value assumed to be zero of the assets to their carrying amount 
the impairment is recorded within the solsil reporting segment 
in  we acquired exploration licenses related to certain mines located in nigeria  which granted us the right to explore for  among other things  manganese ore  a raw material used in the production of certain silicon and manganese based alloys 
during the year  based upon difficulties encountered in gaining secure access to the mines  we determined that exploration of these mines is not feasible and have decided to abandon our plan to conduct exploration activities 
accordingly  we recognized an impairment charge of  representing the aggregate carrying amount of the licenses 
the impairment has been recorded to the corporate segment 
gain on sale of business the gain on sale of business in fiscal year was the result of a subsequent settlement associated with the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  gain on remeasurement of equity investment during fiscal year  we purchased the remaining interest in an existing equity investment 
we recognized a gain on the fair value remeasurement on our existing equity investment 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased by  mainly attributable to the write off of deferred financing costs of approximately  related to the repayment and cancellation of the our senior credit facility and term loan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this was partially offset by higher debt outstanding following the acquisition of quebec silicon on june  other loss income other loss income decreased by  from a gain of  to a loss of  primarily due to the foreign exchange loss of  resulting from the revaluation of a us dollar loan at a foreign subsidiary  the devaluation of the argentine peso and the mark to market and settlement of foreign exchange contracts  offset by the foreign exchange gains from the revaluation of long term brazilian reais denominated liabilities in the prior year 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was approximately or  in fiscal year and was approximately in fiscal year for fiscal year  although we recognized a pre tax loss of  we recognized income tax expense of  primarily as a result of certain impairment charges recognized for which no tax benefit is available or is expected

the increase in average selling prices resulted in an increase in net sales of  with a and increase in selling prices of silicon metal and silicon based alloys  respectively 
the increase in silicon metal pricing was primarily driven by higher pricing of calendar contracts as compared to calendar contracts  as well as improved spot pricing in fiscal year the increase in silicon based alloys pricing was primarily due to an increase in magnesium ferrosilicon pricing  resulting from strong demand from the automotive industry  and a pass through of higher rare earth costs 
ferrosilicon pricing improved as demand improved from the steel industry and the sale of higher purity and specialty grades of ferrosilicon 
metric tons sold remained flat year over year 
there was a decrease in silicon metal tons sold offset by a increase in silicon based alloys tons sold 
the decline in silicon metal tons was primarily due to the timing of the sale of our brazilian manufacturing operations on november  subsequent to this divestiture  remaining globe metais sales related only to the fulfillment of certain retained customer contracts completed at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year  and no further sales will be made under this arrangement 
the silicon volume decrease was partially offset by the acquisition of quebec silicon on june  which contributed  tons during fiscal year silicon based alloys tons sold increased primarily due to demand from the automotive and steel industries

cost of goods sold the  or increase in cost of goods sold was a result of a increase in our cost per ton sold and the increase in by product and other sales 
the increase in cost per ton sold reflects the impact of the planned maintenance performed on six of our fourteen domestic furnaces  the costs associated with the fire at our bridgeport  alabama ferrosilicon facility  and the impact of higher raw material and production costs year over year 
gross margin represented approximately of net sales in fiscal year and decreased from of net sales in fiscal year the decrease was mainly attributable to higher production costs related to the planned maintenance outages  the fire at our bridgeport  alabama facility and the recognition of  in previously deferred revenue in the prior year period

at june   our cash and cash equivalents balance was approximately  and we had  available for borrowing under our existing financing arrangements 
we generated cash flows from operations totaling  during the year ended june  as of june   the amount of cash and cash equivalents  included in the company s consolidated cash that was held by foreign subsidiaries was approximately  if these funds are needed for operations in the us  the company will be required to accrue and pay taxes in the us to repatriate these funds 
however  the company s intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the us and the company s current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate them to fund operations in the us certain of our subsidiaries borrow funds in order to finance working capital requirements and capital expansion programs 
the terms of certain of our financing arrangements place restrictions on distributions of funds to us  however  we do not expect this to have an impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
we believe we have access to adequate resources to meet our needs for normal operating costs  capital expenditure  and working capital for our existing business 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry as well as financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
on august   we refinanced our existing credit facility 
the previous facility that was due to expire may   has been replaced with the new facility that extends the expiration to august   improves pricing and increases the flexibility we have to pursue our strategic objectives all while maintaining the capacity of the revolving credit facility at  plus an accordion feature of an additional  cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources uses of cash during the periods presented year ended june  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash cash and cash equivalents at end of period operating activities our business is cyclical and cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate during the year and from year to year due to economic conditions

we expect to contribute approximately  to our pension plans for the year ended june  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
litigation and contingencies we are subject to various lawsuits  claims and proceedings that arise in the normal course of business  including employment  commercial  environmental  safety and health matters  as well as claims associated with our historical acquisitions and divestitures 
although it is not presently possible to determine the outcome of these matters  in the opinion of management  the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
at june  and june   there are no liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies 
with respect to the cost for ongoing environmental compliance  including maintenance and monitoring  such costs are expensed as incurred unless there is a long term monitoring agreement with a governmental agency  in which case a liability is established at the inception of the agreement 
accounting pronouncements to be implemented in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the provisions of the guidance were effective as of the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
accordingly  we have presented the components of net income and other comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended march  and as two separate but consecutive statements 
in february  the fasb issued guidance that would require an entity to provide enhanced footnote disclosures to explain the effect of reclassification adjustments on other comprehensive income by component and provide tabular disclosure in the footnotes showing the effect of items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income on the line items of net income 
this guidance becomes effective prospectively for the company s fiscal first quarter  with early adoption permitted 
the company will apply this new guidance when it becomes effective  and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and foreign exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  including obtaining captive or long term contracted raw material supplies and hedging strategies 
obtaining captive or long term contracted raw material supplies involves the acquisition of companies or assets for the purpose of increasing our access to raw materials or the identification and effective implementation of long term leasing rights or supply agreements 
we enter into derivative instruments to hedge certain commodity price  interest rate  and foreign currency risks 
we do not engage in commodity  interest rate  or currency speculation  and no derivatives are held for trading purposes 
all derivatives are accounted for using mark to market accounting 
we believe it is not practical to designate our derivative instruments as hedging instruments as defined under asc subtopic  derivatives and hedging asc 
accordingly  we adjust our derivative financial instruments to current market value through the consolidated statement of income based on the fair value of the agreement as of period end 
although not designated as hedged items as defined under asc  these derivative instruments serve to significantly offset our commodity  interest rate  and currency risks 
gains or losses from these transactions offset gains or losses on the assets  liabilities  or transactions being hedged 
no credit loss is anticipated as the counterparties to our derivative agreements are major financial institutions that are highly rated 
the sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below 
see our june  consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies 
commodity prices we are exposed to price risk for certain raw materials and energy used in our production process 
the raw materials and energy which we use are largely commodities  subject to price volatility caused by changes in global supply and demand and governmental controls 
derivative financial instruments are not used extensively to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the cost of commodity products used in our operations 
we attempt to reduce the impact of increases in our raw material and energy costs by negotiating long term contracts and through the acquisition of companies or assets for the purpose of increasing our access to raw materials with favorable pricing terms 
we have entered into long term power supply contracts that result in stable  favorably priced long term commitments for the majority of our power needs 
additionally  we have long term lease mining rights in the us that supply us with a substantial portion of our requirements for quartzite 
we also have obtained a captive supply of electrodes through our ownership interest in yonvey 
in june  we entered into a power hedge agreement on a  mwh notional amount of electricity  representing approximately of the total power required by our niagara falls  new york plant 
this hedge covers our expected needs not supplied by the facility s long term power contract over the term of the hedge agreement 
the notional amount decreases equally per month through the duration of the agreement 
under the power hedge agreement  we fixed the power rate at per mwh over the life of the contract 
this contract expired on june  in october  we entered into a power hedge agreement on a  mwh notional amount of electricity 
the agreement is effective july  and the notional amount decreases equally per month with a fixed power rate at per mwh over the life of the contract 
this contract expired on june  to the extent that we have not mitigated our exposure to rising raw material and energy prices  we may not be able to increase our prices to our customers to offset such potential raw material or energy price increases  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and operating cash flows 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on certain of our short term and long term debt obligations 
the company had outstanding total debt at june  of  with interest rates arranging from to 
the company previously entered into interest rate cap arrangement and swap agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations on its recently terminated senior credit facility and long term debt 
the company settled these agreements in connection with the termination of the senior credit facility and long term debt 
the company would consider entering into hedge agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk  if conditions warrant 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the full fiscal year as compared to the rates in effect at june   we estimate that the change would not have a material impact to our cash flows or results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of operations outside the united states  principally in argentina  canada and china 
a portion of our net sales generated from our non us operations is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of our operating costs for our non us operations are denominated in local currencies  principally the argentine peso and the chinese renminbi 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of our us dollar sales  and related accounts receivable balances  and our operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
derivative instruments are not used extensively to manage this risk 
if foreign exchange rates were to increase or decrease by for the full fiscal year  as compared to the rates in effect at june   we estimate that the change would not have a material impact to our cash flows or results of operations
