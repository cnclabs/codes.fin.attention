our largest brand  dr pepper  is a leading flavored csd in the us according to the nielsen company 
we have some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america  with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers 
we operate as an integrated brand owner  manufacturer and distributor through our three segments 
we believe our integrated business model strengthens our route to market and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our direct store delivery dsd system and our warehouse direct wd delivery system 
our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage 
we operate primarily in the us  mexico and canada and we also distribute our products in the caribbean 
in  of our net sales were generated in the united states  in canada and in mexico and the caribbean 
trends affecting our business we believe the key trends influencing the north american liquid refreshment beverage market include changes in economic factors 
we believe changes in economic factors could impact consumers purchasing power which may result in a decrease in purchases of our premium beverages and single serve packages 
increased health consciousness 
we believe the main beneficiaries of this trend include diet and low calorie drinks  ready to drink teas and bottled waters 
changes in lifestyle 
we believe changes in lifestyle will continue to drive increased sales of single serve beverages  which typically have higher margins 
growing demographic segments in the us we believe marketing and product innovations that target fast growing population segments  such as the hispanic community in the us  will drive further market growth 
product and packaging innovation 
we believe brand owners and bottling companies will continue to create new products and packages  such as beverages with new ingredients and new premium flavors  and innovative convenient packaging that address changes in consumer tastes and preferences 
changing retailer landscape 
as retailers continue to consolidate  we believe retailers will support consumer product companies that can provide an attractive portfolio of products  a strong value proposition and efficient delivery 

table of contents volatility in the costs of raw materials 
the costs of a substantial portion of the raw materials used in the beverage industry are dependent on commodity prices for aluminum  resin  corn  diesel  natural gas  pulp and other commodities 
commodity price volatility has exerted pressure on industry margins and operating results 
seasonality the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations 
our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations 
segments we report our business in three operating segments the beverage concentrates segment reflects sales of our branded concentrates and syrup to third party bottlers primarily in the us and canada 
most of the brands in this segment are csd brands 
the packaged beverages segment reflects sales in the us and canada from the manufacture and distribution of finished beverages and other products  including sales of our own brands and third party brands  through both dsd and wd 
the latin america beverages segment reflects sales in the mexico and caribbean markets from the manufacture and distribution of concentrates  syrup and finished beverages 
segment results are based on management reports 
net sales and segment operating profit sop are the significant financial measures used to assess the operating performance of our operating segments 
volume in evaluating our performance  we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages 
beverage concentrates sales volume in our beverage concentrates segment  we measure our sales volume in two ways concentrate case sales and bottler case sales 
the unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals fluid ounces of finished beverage  the equivalent of twelve ounce servings 
concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors 
a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of fluid ounces of finished beverage 
it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate 
our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases 
although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales  we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels 
packaged beverages sales volume in our packaged beverages segment  we measure volume as case sales to customers 
a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us 
case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to and or distributed by us 
volume in bottler case sales in addition to sales volume  we measure volume in bottler case sales volume bcs as sales of packaged beverages  in equivalent fluid ounce cases  sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors 
our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume bcs 
bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels  which can be affected by seasonality  bottler inventory and manufacturing practices  and the timing of price increases and new product introductions

critical accounting estimates the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary 
we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we conduct tests for impairment annually  as of december  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment 
if the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination and also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units 
we define reporting units as beverage concentrates  latin america beverages  and packaged beverages two reporting units  dsd and wd 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  impairment is recorded 
the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges step 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  impairment is indicated and a second step step analysis must be performed 
for our detailed impairment analysis  we used an income based approach to determine the fair value of our assets  as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and our enterprise value 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
these assumptions could be negatively impacted by various risks discussed in risk factors in this annual report on form k 
critical assumptions include revenue growth and profit performance  as well as an appropriate discount rate 
discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt  adjusted with various risk premiums 
for  such discount rates ranged from to in  we carried forward the detailed determination of the fair value of a reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets based upon the following factors the fair value of our goodwill  brands and distribution rights exceeded their carrying amounts by a substantial margin in the annual impairment analysis performed  our business performance during was in line with our forecast used to estimate fair value in the impairment analysis performed during  our outlook for and beyond was in line with the forecast used to estimate fair value in the impairment analysis performed during  other significant assumptions used in estimating fair value  such as our weighted average cost of capital  improved since the impairment analysis performed  the assets and liabilities that made up the reporting units did not change significantly since the fair value determination  and we experienced significant appreciation in our market capitalization 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the past three years 
the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of december   were  million and  million  respectively 
we have not identified any impairments in goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets during the past three years 
the effect of a increase or decrease in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit or the indefinite lived intangible asset does not change our conclusion regarding the identification of any impairments in goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions customer marketing programs and incentives accruals for customer marketing programs and incentives are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms  volume based metrics and or historical trends 
our customer marketing programs and incentives accrual methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the customer participation and performance levels which impact the expense recognition 
our estimate of the amount and timing of customer participation and performance levels is based primarily on a combination of historical transaction experience and forecasted volumes 
further judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a deduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we used to measure our customer marketing programs and incentives 
a change in the accrual for our customer marketing programs and incentives as of december   would have affected net income by million for the year ended december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of the costs of our customer marketing programs and incentives  at the time risk of loss has been transferred to our customer 
see the discussion above under customer marketing programs and incentives for further information 
our revenue recognition accounting methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the amount of shipments where risk of loss has not yet transferred 
our estimates are based primarily on historical transactional experience  which is reviewed annually 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we used to measure our estimate for shipments where risk of loss has not yet transferred 
a change in the estimate for shipment where the risk of loss has not yet transferred as of december   would have affected net income by less than million for the year ended december  pension and postretirement benefits we have several pension and postretirement plans covering employees who satisfy age and length of service requirements 
depending on the plan  pension and postretirement benefits are based on a combination of factors  which may include salary  age and years of service 
the company largest us defined benefit pension plan  which is a cash balance plan  was suspended and the accrued benefit was frozen effective december  participants in this plan no longer earn additional benefits for future services or salary increases 
employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our consolidated financial statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions  employee demographic data  years of service  compensation  benefits and claims paid and employer contributions 
the calculation of pension and postretirement plan obligations and related expenses is dependent on several assumptions used to estimate the present value of the benefits earned while the employee is eligible to participate in the plans 
the key assumptions we use in the actuarial methods to determine the plan obligations and related expenses include the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities  employee turnover  retirement age and mortality  and the expected return on plan assets 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance 
refer to note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information about the key assumptions 
the effect of a increase or decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the pension benefit obligations for us plans would change the benefit obligation as of december   by approximately million and million  respectively 
the effect of a increase or decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended december   by approximately million 
the effect of a increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended december  by approximately million 
risk management programs we retain selected levels of property  casualty  workers compensation  health and other business risks 
many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or self insured retentions 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our self insured liabilities 
however  the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known 
accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty and health risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors  which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends 
these loss development factors are established in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
the final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents  medical cost inflation  legislative actions  uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control 
a change in our accrued liabilities related to the retained risks as of december   would have affected net income by approximately million for the year ended december  
table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes we establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  or the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions 
we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings  our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
as these audits progress  events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
if results differ from our assumptions  a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate
