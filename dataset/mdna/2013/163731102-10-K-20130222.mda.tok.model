acquisitions acquisition of branches on december   chemical bank acquired branches from independent bank  a subsidiary of independent bank corporation ticker ibcp 
in addition to the branch offices  which are located in the northeast and battle creek regions of michigan  the acquisition included million in deposits and million in loans 
the purchase price of the branch offices  including equipment  was million and the corporation paid a premium on deposits of million  or approximately of total deposits 
the loans were purchased at a discount of 
in connection with the acquisition of the branches  the corporation recorded million of goodwill  which represented the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired  and million of other intangible assets attributable to customer core deposits 
acquisition related expenses associated with the acquisition of the branches totaled million during  which reduced net income per common share by in acquisition of oak financial corporation on april   the corporation acquired oak financial corporation oak for total consideration of million 
oak  a bank holding company  owned byron bank  which provided traditional banking services and products through banking offices serving communities in ottawa  allegan and kent counties in west michigan 
at april   oak had total assets of million  including total loans of million  and total deposits of million  including brokered deposits of million 
the corporation operated byron bank as a separate subsidiary from the acquisition date until july   the date byron bank was consolidated with and into chemical bank 
in connection with the acquisition of oak  the corporation recorded million of goodwill 
goodwill recorded was primarily attributable to the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the corporation and oak 
in addition  the corporation recorded million of other intangible assets in conjunction with the acquisition 
acquisition related expenses associated with the oak acquisition totaled million during  which reduced net income per common share by in critical accounting policies the corporation consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  securities and exchange commission sec rules and interpretive releases and general practices within the industry in which the corporation operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and complex judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value on the financial statements warrants an impairment write down or a valuation reserve to be established 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third party sources  when available 
when third party sources are utilized  the corporation management remains responsible for complying with gaap 
to execute management responsibilities  the corporation has processes in place to develop an understanding of the third party pricing methodologies and to design and implement specific internal controls over valuation 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated by management primarily through the use of internal discounted cash flow analyses  and to the extent available  observable market based inputs 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the corporation are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other notes to the consolidated financial statements and in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  estimates and assumptions underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  accounting for loans acquired in business combinations  pension plan accounting  income and other taxes  the evaluation of goodwill impairment and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such  could be most subject to revision as new or additional information becomes available or circumstances change  including overall changes in the economic climate and or market interest rates 
management reviews the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors at least annually 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses allowance is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
loans represent the corporation largest asset type on the consolidated statements of financial position 
the determination of the amount of the allowance is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected cash flows and collateral values on impaired loans  estimated losses on loans in the commercial loan portfolio comprised of commercial  commercial real estate  real estate construction and land development loans and on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the principal assumption used in deriving the allowance is the estimate of a loss percentage for each type of loan 
in determining the allowance and the related provision for loan losses  the corporation considers four principal elements i specific impairment reserve allocations valuation allowances based upon probable losses identified during the review of impaired loans in the commercial loan portfolio  ii allocations established for adversely rated loans in the commercial loan portfolio and nonaccrual residential mortgage  consumer installment and home equity loans  iii allocations on all other loans based principally on a five year historical loan loss experience and loan loss trends  and iv an unallocated allowance based on the imprecision in the allowance methodology for loans collectively evaluated for impairment 
it is extremely difficult to accurately measure the amount of losses that are inherent in the corporation loan portfolio 
the corporation uses a defined methodology to quantify the necessary allowance and related provision for loan losses  but there can be no assurance that the methodology will successfully identify and estimate all of the losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
as a result  the corporation could record future provisions for loan losses that may be significantly different than the levels that have been recorded in the three year period ended december  notes and to the consolidated financial statements further describe the methodology used to determine the allowance 
in addition  a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance is included under the subheading allowance for loan losses in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation has a loan review function that is independent of the loan origination function 
at least annually  the loan review function reviews management evaluation of the allowance and performs a detailed credit quality review of loans in the commercial loan portfolio  particularly focusing on larger balance loans and loans that have deteriorated below certain levels of credit risk 
accounting for loans acquired in business combinations financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality asc  provides the gaap guidance for accounting for loans acquired in a business combination that have experienced a deterioration in credit quality from origination to acquisition for which it is probable that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable  including both principal and interest 
loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are considered to be impaired 
in the assessment of credit quality deterioration  the corporation must make numerous assumptions  interpretations and judgments using internal and third party credit quality information to determine whether or not it is probable that the corporation will be able to collect all contractually required payments 
this is a point in time assessment and inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved 
evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status  recent borrower credit scores and loan to value percentages 
those loans that qualify under asc are recorded at fair value at acquisition  which involves estimating the expected cash flows to be received 
accordingly  the associated allowance for loan losses related to these loans is not carried over at the acquisition date 
asc also allows investors to aggregate acquired loans into loan pools that have common risk characteristics and use a composite interest rate and expectation of cash flows to be collected for the loan pools 
the corporation understands  as outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants open letter to the office of the chief accountant of the sec dated december   and pending further standard setting  that for acquired loans that do not meet the scope criteria of asc  a company may elect to account for such acquired loans pursuant to the provisions of either asc topic  nonrefundable fees and other costs  or asc the corporation elected to apply asc  by analogy  to loans acquired in the oak acquisition that were determined not to have deteriorated credit quality  and therefore  did not meet the scope criteria of asc accordingly  the corporation follows the accounting and disclosure guidance of asc for these loans 
notes  and to the consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to loans acquired in the oak acquisition 
the excess of cash flows of a loan  or pool of loans  expected to be collected over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loan  or pool of loans  on a level yield basis 
the difference between the contractually required payments of a loan  or pool of loans  and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition  considering the impact of prepayments and estimates of future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan  or pool of loans  is referred to as the nonaccretable difference 
the corporation is required to quarterly evaluate its estimates of cash flows expected to be collected from acquired loans 
these evaluations require the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates  similar to the initial estimate of fair value 
given the current economic environment  the corporation must apply judgment to develop its estimates of cash flows for acquired loans given the impact of changes in property values  default rates  loss severities and prepayment speeds 
decreases in the estimates of expected cash flows will generally result in a charge to the provision for loan losses and a resulting increase to the allowance for loan losses 
increases in the estimates of expected cash flows will generally result in adjustments to the accretable yield which will increase amounts recognized in interest income in subsequent periods 
dispositions of acquired loans  which may include sales of loans to third parties  receipt of payments in full or in part by the borrower and foreclosure of the collateral  result in removal of the loan from the acquired loan portfolio at its carrying amount 
as a result of the significant amount of judgment involved in estimating future cash flows expected to be collected for acquired loans  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses could be significantly impacted by changes in expected cash flows resulting from changes in credit quality of acquired loans 
acquired loans that were classified as nonperforming loans prior to being acquired and acquired loans that are not performing in accordance with contractual terms subsequent to acquisition are not classified as nonperforming loans subsequent to acquisition because the loans are recorded in pools at net realizable value based on the principal and interest the corporation expects to collect on such loans 
judgment is required to estimate the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected when the loans are not performing in accordance with the original contractual terms 
pension plan accounting the corporation has a defined benefit pension plan for certain salaried employees 
effective june   benefits under the defined benefit pension plan were frozen for approximately two thirds of the corporation salaried employees as of that date 
pension benefits continued unchanged for the remaining salaried employees 
at december   employees  or of total employees on a full time equivalent basis  were earning pension benefits under the defined benefit pension plan 
the corporation pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts and measurements 
benefits under the plan are based on years of vested service  age and amount of compensation 
assumptions are made concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments  funding requirements and pension expense 
the key actuarial assumptions used in the pension plan are the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan assets 
these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic pension expense  as well as the respective benefit obligation amounts 
the corporation evaluates these critical assumptions annually 
at december   and  the corporation calculated a discount rate of  and  respectively  for the pension plan using the results from a bond matching technique  which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of the pension plan against a portfolio of bonds of aa quality to determine the discount rate 
the assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on an investment portfolio consisting primarily of equity and fixed income investments 
when determining the expected long term return on pension plan assets  the corporation considers long term rates of return on the asset classes in which the corporation expects the pension funds to be invested 
the expected long term rate of return is based on both historical and forecasted returns of the overall stock and bond markets and the actual portfolio 
the following rates of return by asset class were considered in setting the assumptions for long term return on pension plan assets december  equity securities debt securities other the assumed long term return on pension plan assets is developed through an analysis of forecasted rates of return by asset class and forecasted asset allocations 
it is used to compute the subsequent year expected return on assets  using the market related value of pension plan assets 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension plan assets during the year is either an asset gain or loss  which is deferred and amortized over future periods when determining net periodic pension expense 
the corporation projection of the long term return on pension plan assets was in  and  while the actual return on pension plan assets was  and in  and  respectively 
other assumptions made in the pension plan calculations involve employee demographic factors  such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increase 
the key actuarial assumptions that will be used to calculate pension expense in for the defined benefit pension plan are a discount rate of  a long term rate of return on pension plan assets of and a rate of compensation increase of 
pension expense in is estimated to be approximately million  an increase of approximately million  or  from the increase in pension expense in  as compared to  is primarily attributable to the decrease in the discount rate  which has been largely mitigated by an additional contribution to the pension plan  as discussed further below 
in  a decrease in the discount rate of basis points and basis points is estimated to increase pension expense by million and million  respectively  while an increase of basis points and basis points is estimated to decrease pension expense by approximately the same amounts 
the discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligation and estimated pension expense of the corporation defined benefit pension plan has averaged over the last fifteen years 
however  the discount rate used to estimate the projected benefit obligation and pension expense in  and was significantly below this historical average due to the historically low interest rate environment 
the corporation was not required to make contributions to the pension plan during  or  however  in order to mitigate the increases in the projected benefit obligation and pension expense resulting from the lower discount rates  the corporation made a million contribution to the pension plan in  a million contribution to the pension plan in january related to the plan year  and a million contribution in february related to the plan year 
there are uncertainties associated with the underlying key actuarial assumptions  and the potential exists for significant  and possibly material  impacts on either or both the results of operations and cash flows eg  additional pension expense and or additional pension plan funding  whether expected or required from changes in the key actuarial assumptions 
if the corporation were to determine that more conservative assumptions are necessary  pension expense would increase and have a negative impact on results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs 
the corporation accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in accordance with asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  which requires companies to recognize the over or under funded status of a plan as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation and requires any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the impact of pension plan accounting on the statements of financial position at december  and is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income and other taxes the corporation is subject to the income and other tax laws of the united states  the state of michigan and other states where nexus has been created 
these laws are complex and are subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities 
in determining the provisions for income and other taxes  management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws  related regulations and case law 
in the process of preparing the corporation tax returns  management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of applicable tax laws 
these interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management ongoing assessment of facts and evolving regulations and case law 
the corporation and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the provision for federal income taxes is based on income and expenses  as reported in the consolidated financial statements  rather than amounts reported on the corporation federal income tax return 
when income and expenses are recognized in different periods for tax purposes than for book purposes  applicable deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
on a quarterly basis  management assesses the reasonableness of its effective federal income tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year  including the impact of any discrete items that have occurred 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on a quarterly basis  including the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
reserves for uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly for adequacy based upon developments in tax law and the status of examinations or audits 
as of december  and  there were no federal income tax reserves recorded for uncertain tax positions 
goodwill at december   the corporation had million of goodwill  which was originated through the acquisition of various banks and bank branches  recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested by management annually for impairment  or more frequently if triggering events occur and indicate potential impairment  in accordance with asc topic  goodwill asc 
the corporation goodwill impairment assessment utilizes the methodology and guidelines established in gaap  including assumptions regarding the valuation of chemical bank 
the corporation performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment at october  utilizing the quantitative assessment approach to perform a step valuation of its goodwill as of that date 
the fair value of chemical bank as of october  was measured utilizing the income and market approaches as prescribed in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
gaap identifies the cost approach as another acceptable method  however  the cost approach was not deemed an effective method to value a financial institution 
the cost approach estimates a company value by adjusting the reported values of assets and liabilities to their fair values 
it is the corporation opinion that financial institutions cannot be liquidated in an efficient manner 
estimating the fair value of loans is a very difficult process and subject to a wide margin of error unless done on a loan by loan basis 
voluntary liquidations of financial institutions are not typical 
more commonly  if a financial institution is liquidated  it is due to being taken over by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the value of chemical bank was based as a going concern and not as a liquidation 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts cash flows or earnings to a single  discounted amount 
the income approach includes present value techniques  option pricing models  such as the black scholes formula and lattice models  and the multi period excess earnings method 
in the valuation of chemical bank  the income approach utilized the discounted cash flow method based upon a forecast of growth and earnings 
cash flows are measured by using projected earnings  projected dividends and dividend paying capacity over a five year period 
in addition to estimating periodic cash flows  an estimate of residual value is determined through the capitalization of earnings 
the income approach assumed cost savings and earnings enhancements that a strategic acquiror would likely implement based upon typical participant assumptions of market transactions 
the discount rate is critical to the discounted cash flow analysis 
the discount rate reflects the risk of uncertainty associated with the cash flows and a rate of return that investors would require from similar investments with similar risks 
at the valuation date of october   a discount rate of was utilized in the income approach 
the market approach uses observable prices and other relevant information that are generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
the fair value measure is based on the value that those transactions indicate utilizing both financial and operating characteristics of the acquired companies 
the most significant financial ratio analyzed in completed transactions involved the price to tangible book value 
at the valuation date of october   the market approach utilized a price to tangible book value of 
the fair value of chemical bank was determined to be slightly above the income approach and within the range of values in the market approach value range 
the results of the valuation analysis concluded that the fair value of chemical bank was greater than its book value  including goodwill  and thus no goodwill impairment was evident at the valuation date of october  the weighted average of the fair values determined under the income and market approaches was a premium over the market capitalization of the corporation at the valuation date 
the corporation is publicly traded and  therefore  the price per share of its common stock as reported on the nasdaq stock market establishes the marketable minority value 
it is management opinion that the marketable minority value does not always represent the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole and that an adjustment to the marketable minority value for the acquiror control is generally considered in the assessment of fair value 
the market capitalization of the corporation was million on december   compared to million on october  the corporation determined that no triggering events occurred that indicated potential impairment of goodwill from the most recent valuation date through december  however  the corporation could incur impairment charges related to goodwill in the future due to changes in financial results or other matters that could affect the valuation assumptions 
fair value measurements the corporation determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities in accordance with asc asc establishes a standard framework for measuring and disclosing fair value under gaap 
a number of valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in the corporation financial statements 
the valuation techniques include quoted market prices for investment securities  appraisals of real estate from independent licensed appraisers and other valuation techniques 
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates  and are often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment  the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors 
therefore  the valuation results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability 
additionally  there are inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique  and changes in the underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  could significantly affect the results of current or future values 
significant changes in the aggregate fair value of assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value or for impairment are recognized in the income statement under the framework established by gaap 
see note to the corporation consolidated financial statements for more information on fair value measurements 
accounting standards updates see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for details of accounting pronouncements adopted by the corporation during and recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact on the corporation financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued for public comment a draft proposal designed to improve financial reporting about expected credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks  financial institutions and other organizations 
the proposed asu  financial instruments credit losses  proposes a new accounting model which would change the definition from inherent credit losses to expected credit losses  which could result in more timely recognition of credit losses  and also would provide additional transparency about credit risk 
stakeholders have been asked to review and provide comments to the fasb on the proposal by april  financial highlights the following discussion and analysis is intended to cover significant factors affecting the corporation consolidated statements of financial position and income included in this report 
it is designed to provide a more comprehensive review of the consolidated operating results and financial position of the corporation than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone 
net income net income in was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income in of million  or per diluted share  and net income in of million  or per diluted share 
net income in represented an increase from net income  with the increase primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income and noninterest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses  which were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
net income in represented an increase from net income  with the increase primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses

all other investment securities are based on final contractual maturity 
the aggregate book value of securities issued by any single issuer  other than the us government and government sponsored agencies  did not exceed of the corporation shareholders equity 
the corporation uses a third party pricing service as its primary source for obtaining market value prices for its investment securities portfolio 
on a quarterly basis  the corporation validates the reasonableness of prices received from the third party pricing service through independent price verification on a representative sample of investment securities in the portfolio  data integrity validation through comparison of current market prices to prior period market prices and performing overall analytical expectations of movement in market prices based upon the changes in the related yield curves and other market factors 
on a periodic basis  the corporation reviews the pricing methodology of the third party pricing vendor and the results of their internal control assessments to ensure the integrity of the process that the vendor uses to develop market pricing for the corporation investment portfolio 
the following table summarizes the carrying value of investment securities at december   and table summary of investment securities december  in thousands available for sale government sponsored agencies state and political subdivisions residential mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations corporate bonds preferred stock total investment securities available for sale held to maturity state and political subdivisions trust preferred securities total investment securities held to maturity total investment securities the carrying value of investment securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from investment securities of million at december  the decrease in investment securities during was attributable to the corporation not reinvesting a portion of maturing investment securities in order to fund loan growth 
at december   the corporation investment securities portfolio consisted of million in government sponsored agency gsa debt obligations comprised primarily of fixed rate senior bonds that were issued by the twelve regional federal home loan banks that make up the federal home loan bank system fhlbanks and variable rate instruments backed by the federal farm credit bank  small business administration and student loan marketing corporation  million in state and political subdivisions debt obligations comprised primarily of general debt obligations of issuers primarily located in the state of michigan  million in residential mortgage backed securities mbss comprised of approximately fixed rate and variable rate instruments backed by a us government agency government national mortgage association or government sponsored enterprises the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association  million of collaterized mortgage obligations cmos comprised of approximately fixed rate and variable rate instruments backed by the same us government agency and government sponsored enterprises as the residential mbss  with average maturities of less than three years  million in corporate bonds comprised primarily of debt obligations of large us based global financial organizations  million of preferred stock comprised of preferred stock debt instruments of two large regional national banks and fixed rate cumulative preferred stock issued by a michigan bank holding company under the us government troubled asset relief program tarp  and million of variable rate trust preferred securities trups comprised primarily of a interest in a trup of a small non public bank holding company in michigan 
the corporation records all investment securities in accordance with asc topic  investments debt and equity securities asc  under which the corporation is required to assess equity and debt securities that have fair values below their amortized cost basis to determine whether the decline impairment is other than temporary 
an assessment is performed quarterly by the corporation to determine whether unrealized losses in its investment securities portfolio are temporary or other than temporary by considering all reasonably available information 
the corporation reviews factors such as financial statements  credit ratings  news releases and other pertinent information of the underlying issuer or company to make its determination 
in assessing whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers  among other things i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry or sub sector and iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographical locations 
the corporation investment securities portfolio with a carrying value of million at december   had gross impairment of million at that date 
management believed that the unrealized losses on investment securities were temporary in nature and due primarily to changes in interest rates on the investment securities and market illiquidity  and not as a result of credit related issues 
accordingly  the corporation believed the impairment in its investment securities portfolio at december  was temporary in nature  and therefore  no impairment loss was recognized in the corporation consolidated statement of income for however  other than temporary impairment otti may occur in the future as a result of material declines in the fair value of investment securities resulting from market  credit  economic or other conditions 
a further discussion of the assessment of potential impairment and the corporation process that resulted in the conclusion that the impairment was temporary in nature follows 
at december   the corporation investment securities portfolio had gross impairment of million comprised as follows gsa securities  residential mbss and cmos  combined  with gross impairment of million  state and political subdivisions securities with gross impairment of million  corporate bonds with gross impairment of million and trust preferred securities with gross impairment of million 
the amortized costs and fair values of investment securities are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
gsa securities  residential mbss and cmos included in the available for sale investment securities portfolio  with a combined amortized cost of million  had gross impairment of million at december  virtually all of the impaired investment securities in these categories are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government or a guarantee of a us government agency or government sponsored enterprise 
the corporation determined that the impairment on these investment securities was attributable to current market interest rates being slightly higher than the yields being earned on these investment securities 
the corporation concluded that the impairment of its gsa securities  residential mbss and cmos was temporary in nature at december  state and political subdivisions securities included in both the available for sale and held to maturity investment securities portfolios  with an amortized cost of million  had gross impairment of million at december  the majority of these investment securities are from issuers located in the state of michigan and are general obligations of the issuer  meaning that repayment of these obligations is funded by general tax collections of the issuer 
the gross impairment was attributable to impaired state and political subdivisions securities with an amortized cost of million that generally mature beyond it was the corporation assessment that the impairment on these investment securities was attributable to current market interest rates being slightly higher than the yield earned on these investment securities  illiquidity in the market for a portion of these investment securities caused by the market perception of the michigan economy  and illiquidity in the market due to the nature of a portion of these investment securities 
the corporation concluded that the impairment of its state and political subdivisions securities was temporary in nature at december  corporate bonds included in the available for sale investment securities portfolio  with an amortized cost of million  had gross impairment of million at december  all of the corporate bonds held at december  were of an investment grade 
the investment grade ratings of all of the corporate bonds indicated that the obligors capacities to meet their financial commitments were strong 
it was the corporation assessment that the impairment on the corporate bonds was attributable to current market interest rates being slightly higher than the yield being earned on these investment securities and the recent negative market perception of the financial industry  and not due to credit related issues 
the corporation concluded that the impairment of its corporate bonds was temporary in nature at december  at december   the corporation held two trust preferred securities trups in the held to maturity investment securities portfolio with a combined amortized cost of million that had gross impairment of million 
management reviewed available information of the issuers of the trups as of december  one trup  with an amortized cost of million  represents a interest in a trup of a non public bank holding company in michigan that was purchased in the second quarter of at december   the corporation determined that the fair value of this trup was million 
the second trup  with an amortized cost of million  represents a interest in the trup of another non public bank holding company in michigan 
at december   the corporation determined the fair value of this trup was million 
the fair value measurements of the two trup investments were developed based upon market pricing observations of much larger banking institutions in an illiquid market adjusted by risk measurements 
the fair values of the corporation trups were based on calculations of discounted cash flows  and further based upon both observable inputs and appropriate risk adjustments that market participants would make for performance  liquidity and issuer specifics 
see the additional discussion of the development of the fair values of the trups in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the issuer of the million trup reported net income in each of the three years ended december  and was categorized as well capitalized under applicable regulatory requirements during that time

commercial and commercial real estate lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage  consumer installment and home equity lending as it typically involves larger loan balances concentrated in a single borrower 
in addition  the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties and vacant land loans is typically dependent on the success of the operation of the related project and is typically affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the economy 
the corporation generally attempts to mitigate the risks associated with commercial and commercial real estate lending by  among other things  lending primarily in its market areas  lending across industry lines  not developing a concentration in any one line of business and using prudent loan to value ratios in the underwriting process 
michigan economy showed signs of improvement during and  resulting in lower loan delinquencies compared to the previous three years 
however  the economy in the state of michigan continues to be strained by low levels of economic growth in many areas  resulting in commercial and residential real estate foreclosures continuing to remain higher than historical averages 
accordingly  management expects real estate foreclosures to remain elevated despite improvements in michigan economy 
it is management belief that the loan portfolio is generally well secured  despite declining market values for all types of real estate in the state of michigan and nationwide over the past four years

land development loans were million at december   a decrease of million  or  from land development loans of million at december  land development loans decreased million  or  during from land development loans of million at december  the corporation land development loans were primarily comprised of loans to develop residential real estate at december   and real estate construction and land development lending involves a higher degree of risk than commercial real estate lending and residential mortgage lending because of the uncertainties of construction  including the possibility of costs exceeding the initial estimates  the need to obtain a tenant or purchaser of the property if it will not be owner occupied or the need to sell developed properties 
the corporation generally attempts to mitigate the risks associated with real estate construction and land development lending by  among other things  lending primarily in its market areas  using prudent underwriting guidelines and closely monitoring the construction process 
the corporation risk in this area has increased since early due to the weak economic environment within the state of michigan 
while the economy in michigan began improving in  the sale of lots and units in both residential and commercial development projects remains weak  as customer demand also remains low  resulting in the inventory of unsold lots and housing units remaining high across the state of michigan and resulting in the inability of most developers to sell their finished developed lots and units within their original expected timeframes 
accordingly  the corporation land development borrowers have sold only a small percentage of their developed lots or units since early due to the unfavorable economic environment 
at december   million  or  of the corporation million of land development loans were impaired  whereby the corporation determined it was probable that the full amount of principal and interest would not be collected on these loans in accordance with their original contractual terms

however  the credit risk on home equity loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens increased during the years as property values declined throughout the state of michigan 
while michigan economy has shown signs of improvement  an increase in property values in michigan has been slow to follow

the corporation transfers an originated loan that is days or more past due to nonaccrual status except for loans that are secured by residential real estate  which are transferred at days past due  unless it believes the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
tdrs continue to be reported as nonperforming loans until a six month payment history of principal and interest payments is sustained in accordance with the terms of the loan modification  at which time the loan is no longer considered a nonperforming asset and the corporation moves the loan to a performing tdr status 
nonperforming assets were million at december   a decrease of million  or  from million at december  nonperforming assets also decreased million  or  during from million at december  nonperforming assets comprised  and of total assets at december   and  respectively 
the decreases in nonperforming assets in and were a sign of improvement in the credit quality of the corporation loan portfolio and the improving economic climate in michigan that began in however  the corporation levels of nonperforming assets remained elevated  compared to historical levels  due to an unfavorable economic climate that has existed for more than four years in the state of michigan  which resulted in cash flow difficulties being encountered by many business and consumer loan customers

at december   there was one commercial loan relationship exceeding million  totaling million  that was in nonperforming status 
based on declines in both residential and commercial real estate appraised values due to the weakness in the michigan economy over the past several years  management continues to evaluate and  when appropriate  obtain new appraisals or discount appraised values of existing appraisals to compute estimated net realizable values of nonperforming real estate secured loans and other real estate properties

the largest concentration of the million in nonperforming commercial real estate loans at december  was one customer relationship totaling million that was secured by a combination of vacant land and non owner occupied commercial real estate 
this same customer relationship had another million included in nonperforming real estate construction and land development loans and million included in nonperforming residential mortgage loans 
at december   million of the nonperforming commercial real estate loans were in various stages of foreclosure with borrowers 
challenges remain in the michigan economy  despite some signs of improvement  thus creating a difficult business environment for many lines of business across the state 
nonperforming real estate construction and land development loans were million at december   an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase in nonperforming real estate construction and land development loans was due primarily to one land development loan relationship totaling million moving to nonaccrual status during nonperforming real estate construction and land development loans comprised of total real estate construction and land development loans at december   compared to at december  at december   million of the nonperforming real estate construction and land development loans were land development loans secured primarily by residential real estate improved lots and housing units

nonperforming consumer installment and home equity loans were million at december   a decrease of million  or  from million at december  nonperforming consumer installment and home equity loans comprised of total consumer installment and home equity loans at december   compared to at december troubled debt restructurings tdrs the unfavorable economic climate in michigan has resulted in a large number of both business and consumer customers with cash flow difficulties and thus the inability to maintain their loan balances in a performing status 
the corporation determined that it was probable that certain customers who were past due on their loans  if provided a modification of their loan by reducing their monthly payment  would be able to bring their loan relationship to a performing status 
the corporation believed these modifications would potentially result in a lower level of loan losses and loan collection costs than if the corporation currently proceeded through the foreclosure process with these borrowers 
these modifications involve granting a concession to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty and  therefore  meet the criteria to be considered tdrs 
the corporation loans reported as tdrs continue to accrue interest at the loan original interest rate as the corporation expects to collect the remaining principal balance of the loan 
the interest income recognized on residential mortgage tdrs may include accretion of an identified impairment at the time of modification which is attributable to a temporary reduction in the borrower interest rate 
a tdr is reported as a nonperforming loan nonperforming tdr until a six month payment history of principal and interest payments is sustained in accordance with the loan modification  at which time the corporation moves the loan to a performing status performing tdr 
if a performing tdr becomes contractually past due more than days  it is transferred to a nonperforming status 
accordingly  all of the corporation performing tdrs at december  were current or less than days past due 
the corporation loans reported as tdrs do not include modified loans that are already reported in a nonaccrual status 
the corporation nonaccrual loans at december  and included million and million  respectively  of these modified loans 
the following summarizes the corporation reported tdrs at december  and performing status nonperforming status total current past due days sub total december  in thousands commercial loan portfolio consumer loan portfolio total tdrs december  commercial loan portfolio consumer loan portfolio total tdrs the corporation reported tdrs in the commercial loan portfolio generally consist of loans where the corporation has allowed borrowers to either i temporarily defer scheduled principal payments and make interest only payments for a short period of time generally six months to one year at the stated interest rate of the original loan agreement  ii lower payments due to a modification of the loan original contractual terms  or iii enter into moderate extensions of the loan original contractual maturity date 
the corporation does not expect to incur a loss on these loans based on its assessment of the borrowers expected cash flows  and accordingly  no additional provision for loan losses has been recognized related to these loans 
these tdrs are individually evaluated for impairment and transferred to nonaccrual status if conditions change and it is probable that any remaining principal and interest payments due on the loan will not be collected in accordance with the modified contractual terms of the loan 
once the borrowers under these tdrs have made at least six consecutive months of principal and interest payments  under a formal modification agreement  that follows the temporary deferral period  the loans are classified by the corporation as performing tdrs 
the outstanding balance of nonperforming tdrs in the commercial loan portfolio was million at december   compared to million at december  at december   the corporation had million of performing tdrs in the commercial loan portfolio due to the borrowers sustained repayment histories  compared to million at december  the majority of the corporation performing tdrs in the commercial loan portfolio are categorized as a risk grade substandard accrual under the corporation risk rating system

once the borrowers under these tdrs have made at least six consecutive months of principal and interest payments under a formal modification agreement  they are classified as performing tdrs 
these loans are moved to nonaccrual status if the loan becomes days past due as to principal or interest  or sooner if conditions warrant 
the outstanding balance of nonperforming tdrs in the consumer loan portfolio was million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in nonperforming tdrs in the consumer loan portfolio during was primarily attributable to tdrs moving to performing status due to the borrowers sustained repayment histories 
the corporation had million of performing tdrs in the consumer loan portfolio at both december  and the corporation performing tdrs in the consumer loan portfolio were unchanged during  as the increase resulting from loans moving from nonperforming to performing tdr status during was offset by both borrower payments and tdrs that had reached the end of their initial modification term being refinanced at market interest rates  and thus no longer meet the definition of a tdr 
the corporation recognized million of additional provision for loan losses during  compared to million during  related to impairment on its tdrs in the consumer loan portfolio as a result of the temporary reduction in the borrowers interest rates at the time the loans were modified based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan original effective interest rate

ore totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from million at december  the decrease in ore during was partially attributable to the sale of one ore property  which consisted of vacant land with a carrying value of million 
this ore property was obtained as a result of the corporation receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure on this property during the fourth quarter of that was attributable to a loan acquired in the corporation acquisition of oak 
this loan was impaired at the acquisition date and was recorded at the estimated fair value of the collateral at that time

the corporation million of ore at december  included three ore properties  with a carrying value of million or more  totaling million 
the historically large inventory of real estate properties for sale across the state of michigan has resulted in an increase in the corporation carrying time and cost of holding ore 
consequently  the corporation had million in ore at december  that had been held in excess of one year  of which million had been held in excess of three years 
because the redemption period on foreclosures is relatively long in michigan six months to one year and the corporation had million of nonperforming loans that were in the process of foreclosure at december   it is anticipated that the level of the corporation ore will remain at elevated levels 
all of the corporation ore properties have been written down to fair value through a charge off against the allowance for loan losses at the time the loan was transferred to ore or through a subsequent write down  recorded as an operating expense  to recognize a further market value decline of the property after the initial transfer date 
in addition  ore properties acquired in the acquisition of oak were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition 
accordingly  at december   the carrying value of ore of million was reflective of million in charge offs  write downs or fair value adjustments  and represented of the contractual loan balance remaining at the time the property was transferred to ore 
during  the corporation sold ore properties for net proceeds of million 
on an average basis  the net proceeds from these sales represented of the carrying value of the property at the time of sale  with the net proceeds representing of the remaining loan balance at the time the corporation received title to the properties 
nonperforming assets at december  and did not include acquired loans totaling million and million  respectively  even though these loans were not performing in accordance with their original contractual terms 
acquired loans that are not performing in accordance with contractual terms are not reported as nonperforming loans because these loans are recorded in pools at their net realizable value based on the principal and interest the corporation expects to collect on these loan pools 
acquired loans not performing in accordance with the loan original contractual terms are included in the corporation impaired loan schedule in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when management determines it is probable that all of the principal and interest due will not be collected according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are accounted for at the lower of the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
a portion of the allowance for loan losses is specifically allocated to impaired loans 
the process of measuring impaired loans and the allocation of the allowance for loan losses requires judgment and estimation 
the eventual outcome may differ from amounts estimated 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans  tdrs nonperforming and performing and acquired loans that were not performing in accordance with their original contractual terms

the corporation generally does not recognize a valuation allowance for impaired loans in the consumer loan portfolio as these loans are comprised of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
however  the corporation had a valuation allowance attributable to tdrs in the consumer loan portfolio of million at both december  and  related to the reduction in the present value of expected future cash flows for these loans discounted at their original effective interest rate 
impaired loans included acquired loans totaling million and million at december  and  respectively  that were not performing in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loans 
these loans did not require a valuation allowance as they are recorded in pools at their net realizable value based on the principal and interest the corporation expects to collect on these loan pools 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses allowance provides for probable losses in the originated loan portfolio that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent in the remainder of the originated loan portfolio but that have not been specifically identified 
the allowance is comprised of specific valuation allowances assessed for originated loans that have known credit weaknesses  pooled allowances based on assigned risk ratings and historical loan loss experience for each loan type  and an unallocated allowance for imprecision in the subjective nature of the specific and pooled allowance methodology 
management evaluates the allowance on a quarterly basis in an effort to ensure the level is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation process is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant change and has the potential to affect net income materially 
the corporation methodology for measuring the adequacy of the allowance includes several key elements  which includes a review of the loan portfolio  both individually and by category  and includes consideration of changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  review of collateral values  the financial condition of the borrowers  industry and geographical exposures within the portfolio  economic conditions and employment levels of the corporation local markets and other factors affecting business sectors 
management believes that the allowance is currently maintained at an appropriate level  considering the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
future significant adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  delinquencies or the level of loan losses incurred 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the five years ended december  is included in table table analysis of allowance for loan losses years ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses loan charge offs commercial commercial real estate real estate construction and land development residential mortgage consumer installment and home equity total loan charge offs recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial commercial real estate real estate construction and land development residential mortgage consumer installment and home equity total loan recoveries net loan charge offs allowance for loan losses at end of year allowance for loan losses originated allowance for loan losses acquired allowance for loan losses total net loan charge offs during the year as a percentage of average loans outstanding during the year allowance for loan losses originated as a percentage of total originated loans nonperforming loans economic conditions in the corporation markets  which are primarily within michigan  were generally less favorable than those nationwide during and the economy in michigan showed signs of improvement in and  although economic challenges remain and are expected to continue in accordingly  management believes net loan losses  delinquencies and nonperforming loans will remain at elevated levels 
the following schedule summarizes information related to the allowance for originated loans december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses allowance originated loans nonperforming loans allowance for originated loans as a percent of total originated loans nonperforming loans nonperforming loans  net of impaired originated loans for which the expected loss has been charged off the allowance of the acquired loan portfolio was not carried over on the date of acquisition 
the acquired loans were recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition  with the estimated fair value including a component for expected credit losses 
acquired loans are subsequently evaluated for further credit deterioration in loan pools  which consist of loans with similar credit risk characteristics 
if an acquired loan pool experiences a decrease in expected cash flows as compared to those expected at the acquisition date  a portion of the allowance is allocated to acquired loans 
the corporation established an allowance on the acquired loan portfolio through the provision for loan losses of million in and increased it by million during the establishment of the allowance on the acquired loan portfolio was primarily attributable to one of the fourteen acquired loan pools experiencing a decline in expected cash flows 
during the third quarter of  the corporation charged off million of one loan relationship in this loan pool 
at december   the allowance on the acquired loan portfolio was million and was related to two consumer loan pools performing slightly below original expectations 
there were no material changes in expected cash flows for the remaining acquired loan pools 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses in table is based upon ranges of estimates and is not intended to imply either limitations on the usage of the allowance or exactness of the specific amounts 
the entire allowance attributable to originated loans is available to absorb future loan losses within the originated loan portfolio without regard to the categories in which the loan losses are classified 
the allocation of the allowance is based upon a combination of factors  including historical loss factors  credit risk grading  past due experiences  and other factors  as discussed above

the increase in total deposits during was primarily attributable to the million of deposits acquired in the acquisition of branches on december  excluding these acquired deposits  total deposits increased million  or  during  which included increases in interest and noninterest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits that were partially offset by a decline in certificate of deposit accounts and the corporation paying off maturing brokered deposits 
the corporation experienced a slight change in the mix of deposits during  with a portion of funds from maturing certificates of deposit being transferred by customers into noninterest bearing demand accounts 
noninterest bearing demand deposits were billion at december  compared to million at december  in comparison  certificates of deposit were billion at december  compared to billion at december  at december   the corporation had million in remaining brokered deposits that were acquired in the oak acquisition 
the corporation intends to continue to use its liquidity to pay off brokered deposits as they mature  with million of brokered deposits maturing during total deposits increased million during  with an increase in customer deposits of million being partially offset by million of maturing brokered deposits 
it is the corporation strategy to develop customer relationships that will drive core deposit growth and stability 
the corporation competitive position within many of its market areas has historically limited its ability to materially increase core deposits without adversely impacting the weighted average cost of the deposit portfolio 
while competition for core deposits remained strong throughout the corporation markets during and  the corporation efforts to expand its deposit relationships with existing customers  its financial strength and a general trend in customers holding more liquid assets  have resulted in the corporation experiencing increases in customer deposits 
total deposits increased million and million  excluding brokered and acquired deposits  during and  respectively  while during the same time frame  the corporation experienced a decrease in the average cost of its deposits 
the growth of the corporation deposits can be impacted by competition from other investment products  such as mutual funds and various annuity products 
these investment products are sold by a wide spectrum of organizations  such as brokerage and insurance companies  as well as by financial institutions 
the corporation also competes with credit unions in most of its markets 
these institutions are challenging competitors  as credit unions are exempt from federal income taxes  allowing them to potentially offer higher deposit rates 
in response to the competition for other investment products  chemical bank  through its chemical financial advisors program  offers a wide array of mutual funds  annuity products and marketable securities through an alliance with an independent  registered broker dealer

from time to time  the board of directors of the corporation approves common stock repurchase programs allowing the repurchase of shares of the corporation common stock in the open market 
the repurchased shares are available for later reissuance in connection with potential future stock dividends  the corporation dividend reinvestment plan  employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes 
under these programs  the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors  including the projected parent company cash flow requirements and the corporation share price 
in january  the board of directors of the corporation authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the corporation common stock under a stock repurchase program 
in november  the board of directors of the corporation reaffirmed the stock buy back authorization with the qualification that the shares may only be repurchased if the share price is below the tangible book value per share of the corporation common stock at the time of the repurchase 
since the january authorization  no shares have been repurchased 
at december   there were  remaining shares available for repurchase under the corporation stock repurchase programs 
on april   the shareholders of the corporation approved an amendment to the restated articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from  to net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans  investment and non marketable equity securities and interest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank frb  and interest expense on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is the corporation largest source of net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income  representing of net revenue during  compared to in and in net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis  is the difference between interest income and interest expense adjusted for the tax benefit received on tax exempt commercial loans and investment securities 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average interest earning assets 
net interest spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
because noninterest bearing sources of funds  or free funds principally demand deposits and shareholders equity  also support earning assets  the net interest margin exceeds the net interest spread 
net interest income fte in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the presentation of net interest income on a fte basis is not in accordance with gaap  but is customary in the banking industry 
this non gaap measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax exempt loans and investment securities 
the adjustments to determine tax equivalent net interest income were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
these adjustments were computed using a federal income tax rate 
changes in the corporation net interest income are influenced by a variety of factors  including changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  current and prior years interest rate changes  the level and direction of interest rates  the difference between short term and long term interest rates the steepness of the yield curve and the general strength of the economies in the corporation markets 
risk management plays an important role in the corporation level of net interest income 
the ineffective management of credit risk  and more significantly interest rate risk  can adversely impact the corporation net interest income 
management monitors the corporation consolidated statement of financial position to reduce the potential adverse impact on net interest income caused by significant changes in interest rates 
the corporation policies in this regard are further discussed in the section captioned market risk in item a of this report 
the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions 
the prime interest rate  which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit  was at the end of and remained at this historically low rate through december  the prime interest rate has historically been basis points higher than the federal funds rate 
the federal open market committee fomc has indicated that it will potentially keep the federal funds rate between zero and at least through mid  and therefore  the prime interest rate is expected to remain at or near its current historical low level of during the majority of the corporation variable interest rate loans in the commercial loan portfolio are tied to the prime rate

the reduction in the provision in  compared to both net loan charge offs in and the provision in  was reflective of a continued improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio that included significant decreases in loan charge offs and nonperforming loans and no significant adverse changes in risk grade categories of the commercial loan portfolio 
it is management belief that the overall credit quality of the corporation loan portfolio was positively impacted by an improvement in the economic environment in the state of michigan  with the state unemployment rate declining slightly to at december  from at december   even though it remained higher than the national average unemployment rate of at december  noninterest income the following schedule summarizes the major components of noninterest income during the past three years years ended december  dollars in thousands service charges and fees on deposit accounts wealth management revenue electronic banking fees mortgage banking revenue other fees for customer services insurance commissions gain on sale of merchant card services other total noninterest income noninterest income as a percentage of net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income average total assets noninterest income was million in  million in and million in noninterest income in included nonrecurring income of million  including million attributable to a gain from the sale of the corporation merchant card servicing business  million from a partial insurance recovery of a branch cash loss and million from a merchant card vendor settlement

loan collection costs include legal fees  appraisal fees and other costs recognized in the collection of loans with deteriorated credit quality and in the process of foreclosure 
credit related expenses were million in  million in and million in credit related expenses in decreased million  or  from due largely to the corporation recognizing net gains of million on the sale write down of ore properties during  compared to incurring net expense on the sale write down of ore properties of million during the additional reduction in credit related expenses of million in  compared to  was attributable to lower ore operating costs  lower legal collection costs and lower appraisal fees on nonperforming and watch loan credits as the credit quality of the corporation loan portfolio continued to improve 
credit related expenses in increased million  or  from due to a million increase in net expense on the sale write down of ore properties and a million increase in ore operating costs  which were partially offset by a million reduction in loan collection costs 
property taxes on ore were million in  million in and million in other operating costs on ore were million in  million in and million in donations were million in  million in and million in donations in increased million  or  over due primarily to the establishment of the chemical bank foundation in the chemical bank foundation was established with the intent of building an endowment that will serve to award grants to organizations that improve the quality of life throughout the communities served by the corporation 
donations in increased million  or  over due primarily to several large charitable pledges made by the corporation in all other categories of operating expenses totaled million in  million in and million in all other categories of operating expenses in included million of acquisition related expenses  while included the reversal of a million state tax accrual as a result of the elimination of a state tax contingent liability 
excluding acquisition related expenses and the state tax accrual reversal  all other categories of operating expenses in increased million  or  over  while all other categories of operating expenses in increased million  or  from the corporation efficiency ratio  which measures total operating expenses excluding nonrecurring acquisition related transaction expenses divided by the sum of net interest income fte and noninterest income excluding nonrecurring income  was in  in and in income taxes the corporation effective federal income tax rate was in  in and in the fluctuations in the corporation effective federal income tax rate reflect changes each year in the proportion of interest income exempt from federal taxation  nondeductible interest expense and other nondeductible expenses relative to pretax income and tax credits 
based on the corporation assessment of uncertain tax positions during  and  no adjustments to the federal income tax provision were required 
the corporation had no uncertain tax positions during the three years ended december  the increases in the corporation effective federal income tax rate in and  compared to and  respectively  were due primarily to increases in the corporation pre tax income 
tax exempt income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis  net of related nondeductible interest expense  totaled million in  million in and million in tax exempt income fte as a percentage of total interest income fte was in both and  compared to in income before income taxes fte was million in  million in and million in liquidity liquidity measures the ability of the corporation to meet current and future cash flow needs in a timely manner 
liquidity risk is the adverse impact on net interest income if the corporation was unable to meet its cash flow needs at a reasonable cost 
liquidity is managed to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of funds are available to satisfy deposit withdrawals and lending and investment opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure  its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds 
the corporation manages its funding needs by maintaining a level of liquid funds through its asset liability management process 
the corporation largest sources of liquidity on a consolidated basis are the deposit base that comes from consumer  business and municipal customers within the corporation local markets  principal payments on loans  maturing investment securities  cash held at the federal reserve bank frb and unpledged investment securities available for sale 
excluding brokered and other deposits acquired in acquisitions  customer deposits increased million  or  during  compared to an increase of million  or  during despite loans increasing million  or  during  the corporation loan to deposit ratio decreased to at december  from at december  due primarily to million of deposits that were acquired in the corporation acquisition of branches during at december  and  the corporation had million and million  respectively  of cash deposits held at the frb that were not invested in federal funds sold due to the low interest rate environment 
in addition  at december   the corporation had unpledged investment securities available for sale with an amortized cost of million 
the corporation also has available unused wholesale sources of liquidity  including fhlb advances and borrowings from the discount window of the frb 
chemical bank is a member of the fhlb and as such has access to short term and long term advances from the fhlb that are generally secured by residential mortgage first lien loans 
the corporation considers advances from the fhlb as its primary wholesale source of liquidity 
the corporation fhlb advances were million at december  the corporation prepaid all of its fhlb advances outstanding as of december  on january  at december   the corporation additional borrowing availability from the fhlb  based on its fhlb capital stock and subject to certain requirements  was million excluding the prepayment of million in january 
chemical bank can also borrow from the frb discount window to meet short term liquidity requirements 
these borrowings are required to be secured by investment securities and or certain loan types  with each category of assets carrying various borrowing capacity percentages 
at december   chemical bank maintained an unused borrowing capacity of million with the frb discount window based upon pledged collateral as of that date 
it is management belief that the corporation borrowing capacity at both the fhlb and frb could be expanded  if deemed necessary  as chemical bank has additional borrowing capacity available at the fhlb that could be used if it increased its investment in fhlb capital stock  and chemical bank has a significant amount of additional assets that could be used as collateral at the frb discount window 
the corporation manages its liquidity position to provide the cash necessary to pay dividends to shareholders  invest in new subsidiaries  enter new banking markets  pursue investment opportunities and satisfy other operating requirements 
the corporation primary source of liquidity is dividends from chemical bank 
federal and state banking laws place certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company 
during  chemical bank paid million in dividends to the corporation and the corporation paid cash dividends to shareholders of million 
during  chemical bank paid million in dividends to the corporation and the corporation paid cash dividends to shareholders of million 
the corporation had million in cash at december   which it held in a deposit account at chemical bank 
the earnings of chemical bank have been the principal source of funds to pay cash dividends to the corporation shareholders 
over the long term  cash dividends to shareholders are dependent upon earnings  capital requirements  regulatory restraints and other factors affecting chemical bank

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due primarily to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is the corporation primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and changes in relationships between rate indices due to changes in interest rates 
the corporation net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
the corporation goal is to avoid a significant decrease in net interest income  and thus an adverse impact on the profitability of the corporation  in periods of changing interest rates 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change differently from the interest costs on liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is determined by the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing within a specific time period and the magnitude by which interest rates change on the various types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the management of interest rate sensitivity includes monitoring the maturities and repricing opportunities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation interest rate risk is managed through policies and risk limits approved by the boards of directors of the corporation and chemical bank and an asset and liability committee alco 
the alco  which is comprised of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation and chemical bank  including finance  lending  investments and deposit gathering  meets regularly to execute asset and liability management strategies 
the alco establishes guidelines and monitors the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
the goal of the alco process is to manage the impact on net interest income and the net present value of future cash flows of probable changes in interest rates within authorized risk limits 
the primary technique utilized by the corporation to measure its interest rate risk is simulation analysis 
simulation analysis forecasts the effects on the balance sheet structure and net interest income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in interest rates  the shape of the treasury yield curve  interest rate relationships and the mix of assets and liabilities and loan prepayments 
these forecasts are compared against net interest income projected in a stable interest rate environment 
while many assets and liabilities reprice either at maturity or in accordance with their contractual terms  several balance sheet components demonstrate characteristics that require an evaluation to more accurately reflect their repricing behavior 
key assumptions in the simulation analysis include prepayments on loans  probable calls of investment securities  changes in market conditions  loan volumes and loan pricing  deposit sensitivity and customer preferences 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain as they are subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment 
as a result  the simulation analysis cannot precisely forecast the impact of rising and falling interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to many other factors  including changes in balance sheet components  interest rate changes  changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the corporation interest rate sensitivity is estimated by first forecasting the next twelve months of net interest income under an assumed environment of constant market interest rates 
the corporation then compares the results of various simulation analyses to the constant interest rate forecast base case 
at december  and  the corporation projected the change in net interest income during the next twelve months assuming short term market interest rates were to uniformly and gradually increase or decrease by up to basis points in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve during the same time period 
additionally  the corporation projected the change in net interest income of an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates at december  and the corporation did not project an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates as the likelihood of a decrease of this size was considered unlikely given prevailing interest rate levels 
these projections were based on the corporation assets and liabilities remaining static over the next twelve months  while factoring in probable calls and prepayments of certain investment securities and residential mortgage and consumer loans 
the alco regularly monitors the corporation forecasted net interest income sensitivity to ensure that it remains within established limits 
a summary of the corporation interest rate sensitivity at december  and follows gradual change immediate change december  twelve month interest rate change projection in basis points percent change in net interest income vs 
constant rates december  twelve month interest rate change projection in basis points percent change in net interest income vs 
constant rates at december   the model simulations projected that  and basis point increases in interest rates  as previously discussed  would result in positive variances in net interest income of  and  respectively  relative to the base case over the next month period  while decreases in interest rates of and basis points would result in negative variances in net interest income of and  respectively  relative to the base case over the next month period 
at december   the model simulations projected that  and basis point increases in interest rates  as previously discussed  would result in positive variances in net interest income of  and  respectively  relative to the base case over the next month period  while decreases in interest rates of and basis points would result in negative variances in net interest income of and  respectively  relative to the base case over the next month period 
the likelihood of a decrease in interest rates beyond basis points at december  and was considered to be unlikely given prevailing interest rate levels 
future increases in market interest rates are not expected to have a significant immediate favorable impact on the corporation net interest income at the time of such increases because of the low percentage of variable interest rate loans in the corporation loan portfolio and a large percentage of variable interest rate loans at interest rate floors at december  variable interest rate loans comprised of the corporation loan portfolio at december   compared to at december  approximately two thirds of the corporation variable interest rate loans were at an interest rate floor and are expected to remain at their floor until they mature or market interest rates rise more than basis points 
to reduce the risk of rising interest rates adversely impacting net interest income  the corporation has positioned its balance sheet to be more asset sensitive by holding some variable rate instruments in its investment securities portfolio 
variable rate investment securities at december  were million  or of total investment securities  compared to million  or of total investment securities  at december  the interest rate sensitivity of the corporation balance sheet was also impacted by the increase of cash held at the frb  which totaled million at december   up from million at december   with the increase primarily due to the deposits acquired in the branch acquisition transaction 
the fomc has indicated that it will keep the federal funds rate at between zero and at least through mid  and therefore  corresponding increases in other market interest rates that are generally tied to the federal funds rate  such as the prime interest rate  are not expected to increase during
