forward looking statements and risk factors this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is based upon the consolidated financial statements for eastman chemical company eastman or the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted gaap in the united states  and should be read in conjunction with the company consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k this annual report 
all references to earnings per share eps contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted 
on july   the company completed its acquisition of solutia inc solutia  a global leader in performance materials and specialty chemicals 
the fair value of total consideration transferred was approximately billion  consisting of cash of billion  net of cash acquired  equity in the form of eastman stock of approximately million  and the assumption and subsequent repayment of solutia debt at fair value of approximately billion 
for additional information  see note  acquisitions and investments in joint ventures  to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
as of the date of acquisition  results of the acquired solutia businesses are included in eastman results 
beginning in third quarter  the company changed its reportable segments due to changes in the company organization resulting from the acquisition of solutia 
eastman currently has five reporting segments additives functional products  adhesives plasticizers  advanced materials  fibers  and specialty fluids intermediates 
the new reporting structure has been retrospectively applied to financial results of all periods presented

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in first quarter  eastman elected to change its method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses for its pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans to a more preferable method permitted under gaap 
the current method recognizes actuarial gains and losses in the company operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur rather than amortizing them over future periods 
under the current method of accounting  these gains and losses are measured annually at december and recorded as a mark to market mtm adjustment during the fourth quarter of each year 
any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment  settlement  or significant plan changes are recognized as an mtm adjustment in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs 
the current method has been retrospectively applied to financial results of all periods presented 
for additional information  see note  accounting methodology change for pension and other postretirement benefit plans to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  the company management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  environmental costs  pension and other post employment benefits  litigation and contingent liabilities  income taxes  and purchase accounting 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the company financial condition and results 
these estimates require management most significant judgments in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company believes  based on historical results  the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results is low 
however  if one of the company key customers was to file for bankruptcy  or otherwise be unwilling or unable to make its required payments  or there was a significant slow down in the economy  the company could increase its allowances 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 
the company allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable  an analysis of fair value is triggered 
an impairment is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value 
the company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in third quarter of each year  unless events warrant more frequent testing 
the testing of goodwill was performed at the reporting unit level which management determined to be its operating segments 
the company applies a fair value methodology in testing the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit 
the key assumptions and estimates used in the company goodwill impairment testing included a long term projection of revenues  expenses  and cash flows  the estimated weighted average cost of capital  and the estimated corporate tax rate 
the company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made 
however  actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the company estimates 
in addition  the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different determinations 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit including goodwill  additional steps  including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  would be necessary to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting of various trademarks  are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount 
the estimated fair value of the trademarks is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings  discounted by the company estimated cost of capital 
the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets is considered to be impaired when the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademarks 
as a result of the tests performed during third quarter  no impairment was determined to exist for goodwill or any of the company indefinite lived intangible assets 
in the goodwill impairment analysis performed  fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values for each reporting unit 
as a result of the acquisition of solutia  the company recorded  million of goodwill and million of indefinite lived intangible assets 
as required by purchase accounting guidance  the company performed a determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired with the purchase of solutia in third quarter therefore  the goodwill and intangible assets from the acquisition were excluded from the current year annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
as the company assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change  write downs may be required in the future 
if estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised  the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted  resulting in a charge to earnings 
the company recognized a definite lived intangible asset impairment charge of million resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter impacting the fair value of air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued beaumont  texas  industrial gasification project 
environmental costs the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid out within years and the company assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs ranged from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  the maximum estimated future costs are considered to be reasonably possible and are inclusive of the amounts accrued at december  in accordance with gaap  the company also establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains 
environmental assets  as defined by gaap  include but are not limited to waste management units  such as landfills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements 
these future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
currently  the company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to years 
if the company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets  expenses charged against earnings could increase or decrease 
in accordance with gaap  the company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs 
the company reserve  including the above remediation  was million at december  and million at december   representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs 
amounts at december  included environmental contingencies assumed in the acquisition of solutia on july  see note  acquisitions and investments in joint ventures to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension and other post employment benefits the company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits 
additionally  eastman subsidizes life insurance  health care  and dental benefits for eligible retirees and health care and dental benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates and expected return on plan assets 
in july  as part of its acquisition of solutia  the company assumed solutia us and us defined benefit pension and opeb plans 
prior to the acquisition  the us pension plans had been closed to new participants and were no longer accruing additional benefits 
in  as part of its acquisition of sterling chemicals  inc sterling  the company assumed sterling us pension plans 
for valuing the obligations and assets of the company us and non us defined benefit pension plans  the company assumed weighted average discount rates of percent and percent  respectively  and a weighted average expected return on plan assets of percent and percent  respectively  at december  the company assumed a weighted average discount rate of percent for its opeb plans and an expected return on plan assets of percent for its voluntary employees beneficiary association retiree trust at december  the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
the december  projected benefit obligation and expense are affected by year end assumptions 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the company long term assumptions in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for all pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans 
the sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted 
they also may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 
change in assumption impact on pre tax benefits expense excludes mark to market impact pension plans impact on december  projected benefit obligation for pension plans impact on pre tax benefits expense excludes mark to market impact other postretirement welfare plans impact on december  benefit obligation for other postretirement welfare plans us non us basis point decrease in discount rate million million million million million basis point increase in discount rate million million million million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million no impact no impact million no impact basis point increase in expected return on assets million no impact no impact million no impact

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the company pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each december the expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the trusts invest their funds  primarily in the following markets us and us fixed income  us and us public equity  private equity  and real estate markets 
historically  over a ten year period  the company average achieved actual return has been near the expected return on assets 
the assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high grade corporate bonds  which are used to develop a yield curve 
this yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post employment benefit obligations 
as future health care benefits under the us benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount  changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations 
the company uses fair value accounting for plan assets 
if actual experience differs from long term assumptions for asset returns and discount rates  the difference is recognized as part of the mtm adjustment during the fourth quarter of each year  and any other quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered 
the mtm charges applied to earnings from continuing operations in   and due to the actual experience versus assumptions of returns on plan assets and discount rates for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans were million  million  and million  respectively 
at december   the company weighted average assumed discount rate was percent  down significantly from the prior year  resulting in an actuarial loss of approximately million 
partially offsetting the impact of the lower discount rate was an increase in pension asset values of approximately million due to asset values appreciating in excess of the assumed weighted average rate of return of percent 
the company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate during will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during while the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements  it is an indication of the amount the company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years 
the amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates  actual returns on plan assets  retirement  attrition rates of employees  and other factors 
for further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations  see note  retirement plans  to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  the company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
the company expenses legal costs  including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency  as incurred 
based upon facts and information currently available  the company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by monetary damages  costs or expenses  and charges against earnings in particular periods 
income taxes the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the ability to realize deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in the event that the actual outcome from future tax consequences differs from management estimates and assumptions  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million has been provided against the deferred tax assets 
the company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions  which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations purchase accounting in general  the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
the company estimates fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market 
an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of unrelated market participants as a whole  in the principal or most advantageous market  and may result in the company valuing assets or liabilities at a fair value that is not reflective of the company intended use of the assets or liabilities 
any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired or liabilities assumed is recorded in the line item goodwill on the company consolidated balance sheets 
management judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives for property  plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets  and can materially affect the company results of operations 
non gaap and pro forma combined financial measures in addition to evaluating the company financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows as reported in accordance with gaap  eastman management also evaluates company and operating segment performance  and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions  after giving effect to transactions  costs  and gains that do not directly arise from eastman normal  or core  business and operations  or are otherwise of an unusual or non recurring nature 
these transactions  costs and gains relate to  among other things  cost reduction  growth and profitability improvement initiatives  and other events outside of core business operations 
because non core or non recurring costs and gains may materially affect the company  or any particular operating segment  financial condition or results in a specific period in which they are recognized  eastman believes it is appropriate to evaluate both the financial measures prepared and calculated in accordance with gaap and the related non gaap financial measures 
in addition to using such measures to evaluate results in a specific period management believes that such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of the company  and its segments  operational performance on a period over period historical basis and a better indication of expected future trends 
management discloses these non gaap measures  and the related reconciliations  because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer term period over period performance  and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess the company  and its operating segments  performance  make resource allocation decisions and evaluate organizational and individual performance in determining certain performance based compensation 
non gaap measures do not have definitions under gaap  and may be defined differently by  and not be comparable to  similarly titled measures used by other companies 
as a result  management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on any non gaap measure  but to consider such measures with the most directly comparable gaap measure 
the non core or non recurring items excluded by management in its evaluation of certain results in this annual report are as follows costs resulting from the sale of acquired solutia inventories at fair value  net of the last in  first out lifo impact of these inventories as required by purchase accounting  these inventories were marked to fair value  and were sold in  solutia acquisition  financing  transaction  and integration costs  including the costs and fees for borrowings used to complete the solutia acquisition and pre acquisition interest expense for acquisition related borrowings  which  similar to the costs resulting from the sale of solutia inventories  resulted from non core transactions not expected to impact eastman results consistently  mtm pension and opeb losses  net  which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates  and not from eastman core operations  asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains  net  which  other than certain severance costs  are not cash transactions impacting profitability  and early debt extinguishment costs  in each case for the periods and in the amounts in the table below

in addition to the above  in order to provide the most meaningful comparison of results  some of the following corporate and segment discussion and analysis includes both actual results for all periods presented and results on a pro forma combined basis 
the unaudited pro forma combined information is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of both eastman and solutia and has been prepared to illustrate the effects of the company acquisition of solutia  assuming the acquisition of solutia had been consummated on january   the beginning of the earliest period presented 
for  pro forma combined results reflect actual results for third and fourth quarter plus pro forma combined results for first six months the accompanying pro forma combined financial information does not give pro forma effect to any other transactions or events 
the unaudited pro forma combined information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have actually occurred  or the financial position  had the acquisition been completed as of the dates indicated  nor is it indicative of the future operating results  or financial position  of eastman 
the unaudited pro forma combined information does not reflect future events that may occur after the acquisition of solutia  including the potential realization of any future operating cost savings synergies or restructuring activities or other costs related to the planned integration of solutia and yet to be incurred  and does not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or expense efficiencies

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the unaudited pro forma combined information reflects only the combination of eastman and solutia 
the unaudited pro forma combined financial results include certain adjustments for additional depreciation and amortization expense based upon the fair value step up and estimated useful lives of solutia depreciable fixed assets and limited life amortizable assets acquired in the transaction 
additionally  in the preparation of unaudited pro forma combined sales and earnings from continuing operations  solutia historical consolidated results have been retrospectively adjusted for the change in accounting methodology for pension and opeb plans actuarial losses and gains adopted by eastman during first quarter in conjunction with the change in accounting principle  the service cost  which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period  and amortization of prior service credits continue to be allocated to each segment 
interest costs  expected return on assets  and the mtm adjustment for actuarial losses and gains are now included in corporate expense and not allocated to segments 
for additional information  see note  accounting methodology change for pension and other postretirement benefit plans to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
the information also includes adjustments to solutia exclusions from operating earnings in order to be consistent with eastman non gaap presentation 
in addition  corporate expenses and gains and losses from asset dispositions and restructuring charges that were previously reported as other have now been allocated to eastman reportable segments using a percentage of total revenue methodology based on solutia full year results 
this allocation of corporate overhead from other to the reportable segment is in accordance with eastman presentation of such costs 
these non gaap and pro forma combined financial measures  and the accompanying reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures  are presented in results of operations and summary by operating segment in this md a 
in addition to the non gaap measures presented in this annual report and other periodic reports  from time to time management evaluates and discloses to investors and securities analysts the non gaap measure cash provided by operating activities excluding certain items cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted when analyzing  among other things  business performance  liquidity and financial position  and performance based compensation 
eastman management uses this non gaap measure in conjunction with the gaap measure cash provided by operating activities because it believes it is a more appropriate metric to evaluate the cash flows from eastman core operations that are available to grow the business and create stockholder value  as well as because it allows for a more consistent period over period presentation of such amounts 
in its evaluation  eastman management generally excludes the impact of certain non core activities and decisions of management because such activities and decisions are not considered core  on going components of continuing operations and the decisions to undertake or not to undertake such activities may be made irrespective of the cash generated from continuing operations 
from time to time  management discloses this non gaap measure and the related reconciliation to investors and securities analysts to allow them to better understand and evaluate the information used by management in its decision making processes and because management believes investors and securities analysts use similar measures to assess company performance  liquidity  and financial position over multiple periods and to compare these with other companies 
similarly  from time to time  eastman discloses to investors and securities analysts a non gaap measure of free cash flow  which management defines as cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted  described above  less the amounts of capital expenditures and dividends  as management believes such items are generally funded from available cash and  as such  should be considered in determining free cash flow 
eastman management believes this is the appropriate metric to use to evaluate the company overall ability to generate cash to fund future operations  inorganic growth opportunities  and to meet the company debt repayment obligations 
management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities analysts in order to provide them with information similar to that used by management in evaluating potential future cash available for various initiatives and because management believes investors and securities analysts often use a similar measure of free cash flow to compare the results  and value  of comparable companies

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating earnings were million in compared to million in excluding items referenced in non gaap and pro forma combined financial measures  operating earnings were  million in and  million in operating earnings increased in all segments  primarily due to earnings from acquired solutia product lines in operating earnings also increased in due to lower raw material and energy costs more than offsetting lower selling prices in the additives functional products segment  higher sales volume in the adhesives plasticizers segment  higher selling prices more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs in the fibers segment  and the benefit of producing versus purchasing olefins in the specialty fluids intermediates segment 
these increases were partially offset by higher operating costs  particularly for increased maintenance for cracking unit assets in the specialty fluids intermediates segment  capacity expansions in the adhesives plasticizers and advanced materials segments  and higher unit costs resulting from lower capacity utilization rates in the advanced materials segment 
earnings from continuing operations were million in compared to million in earnings from continuing operations were per diluted share in compared to per diluted share in excluding items referenced in non gaap and pro forma combined financial measures  earnings from continuing operations in and were million and million  respectively 
excluding these items  earnings from continuing operations for and were per diluted share and per diluted share  respectively 
on a pro forma combined basis  sales revenue was relatively unchanged at billion and billion in and  respectively 
on a pro forma combined basis  operating earnings were million in compared to  million in in addition to items referenced in non gaap and pro forma combined financial measures  pro forma combined operating earnings in also included million for restructuring charges related to solutia acquisition of southwall technologies inc southwall and in also included a gain of million from certain other rubber chemicals divestitures by solutia in the additives functional products segment and million in other operating income from the sale by solutia of its remaining ownership interest in ascend performance materials holdings inc these transactions each occurred prior to eastman acquisition of solutia  and were previously reported by solutia 
excluding all items  operating earnings were  million in compared to  million in an increase in operating earnings primarily in the specialty fluids intermediates  additives functional products  and fibers segments more than offset a decline in operating earnings in the advanced materials segment  growth initiatives  and photovoltaics  primarily due to lower sales volume 
eastman generated billion in cash from operating activities in  net of million in contributions to its us defined benefit pension plans  compared to million cash generated from operating activities during  net of million in cash contributed to its us defined benefit pension plans 
the increase was primarily due to a decrease in working capital requirements  particularly in inventories  and increased cash earnings from the company business segments primarily due to the july  acquisition of solutia 
as part of the financing of the acquisition of solutia  on june   eastman received billion net proceeds from the public offering of notes due   and and on july   borrowed billion under a five year term loan agreement the term loan 
in addition  the company issued million shares of eastman common stock and  warrants to purchase shares of eastman common stock and cash per warrant upon payment of the warrant exercise price of

sales volume also increased in the adhesives plasticizers segment  particularly in the plasticizers product lines  and in the additives functional products segment for the solvents product lines 
sales volume for the specialty materials product lines decreased in the advanced materials segment 
higher selling prices in the fibers and advanced materials segments were more than offset by lower selling prices in the specialty fluids intermediates and additives functional products segments 
on a pro forma combined basis  sales revenue decreased slightly in compared to compared to sales revenue for compared to increased billion 
the increase was primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments particularly in the specialty fluids intermediates segment and higher sales volume primarily in the specialty fluids segment 
the higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs  primarily for propane  paraxylene  and wood pulp 
the higher sales volume was primarily due to the fourth quarter restart of a previously idled olefins cracking unit at the longview  texas facility  growth in adhesives plasticizers segment plasticizer product lines  and strengthened end use demand primarily for additives functional products segment products 
the increase was also due to growth initiatives including the increased utilization of the korean acetate tow manufacturing facility and the eastman tritan copolyester resin manufacturing line  and the impact from the acquisition of the genovique specialties corporation genovique plasticizer product lines

borrowings also included the billion term loan 
financing fees for the term loan and related financing commitments were approximately million 
the payment of dividends  which was million and million in and respectively  increased primarily due to accelerated timing of payment of the fourth quarter dividend and some impact from increased shares outstanding due to the acquisition of solutia and an increase of the quarterly dividend rate 
cash used in financing activities increased million in compared with higher cash outflows for share repurchases and dividends and lower proceeds from borrowings and stock option exercises were mostly offset by significantly lower cash outflows for repayment of borrowings

at december  and december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes 
accordingly  any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce capacity for borrowings available under the revolving credit facility 
given the expiration date of the revolving credit facility  any commercial paper borrowings supported by the revolving credit facility are classified as long term borrowings because the company has the ability and intent to refinance such borrowings on a long term basis 
in april  the company increased the line of credit under its accounts receivable securitization agreement the a r facility to million from million and extended the maturity date to april borrowings under the a r facility are subject to interest rates based on a spread over the lender borrowing costs  and the company pays a fee to maintain availability of the a r facility

in and  the company made million and million  respectively  in contributions to its us defined benefit pension plans 
excess contributions are periodically made by management in order to keep the plans funded status above percent under the funding provisions of the pension protection act to avoid partial benefit restrictions on accelerated forms of payment 
the eastman retirement assistance plan and sterling pension plan are not currently under any benefit restrictions 
as of december   the solutia union and cash balance plans are currently subject to partial benefit restrictions on accelerated forms of payments 
the impact of federal legislation enacted in july  which reduces required us pension funding by spreading the expected funding requirements for the company us pension plans over a longer period of time  is reflected in the reduced minimum required contribution of approximately million noted above 
the company expects us defined benefit pension plan funding of approximately million in the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
an analysis of trends including the aging of accounts receivable and days sales outstanding is performed on a regular basis in order to ensure appropriate adjustments are made to the allowance for doubtful accounts in a timely manner 
no significant variances were identified in the trend analysis performed for fourth quarter compared to third quarter the company believes  based on historical results and its regular analysis  the likelihood of write offs having a material adverse impact on financial results is remote 
cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents  and the other sources of liquidity described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
however  the company cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations  raw material availability and cost  demand for and pricing of eastman products  capacity utilization  and other factors described under forward looking statements and risk factors below

this investment is accounted for under the equity method 
eastman net investment in the joint venture at december  and was approximately million and million  respectively  which was comprised of the recognized portion of the venture accumulated deficits  long term amounts owed to primester  and a line of credit from eastman to primester 
the company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including special purpose entities  for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes 
thus  eastman is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships 
guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with joint venture partners  suppliers  customers  and other parties when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others  if specified triggering events occur 
non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company 
the company current other guarantees include guarantees relating primarily to intellectual property  environmental matters  and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business 
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims  if they were to occur 
these other guarantees have terms of between and years with maximum potential future payments of approximately million in the aggregate  with none of these guarantees individually significant to the company operating results  financial position  or liquidity 
the company current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non performance under other guarantees is considered remote

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental certain eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment  storage  transportation  and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies 
in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites  the company  along with many other entities  has been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs 
in addition  the company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act 
reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman policies as described in note  significant accounting policies  to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
although the resolution of uncertainties related to these environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated results of operations in the period recognized  because of expected sharing of costs  the availability of legal defenses  and the company preliminary assessment of actions that may be required  management does not believe that the company liability for these environmental matters  individually or in the aggregate  will be material to the company consolidated financial position or cash flows 
the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid out within years and the company assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs ranged from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  the maximum estimated future costs are considered to be only reasonably possible and include the amounts accrued at december  amounts at december  included environmental contingencies assumed in the acquisition of solutia 
see note  acquisitions and investments in joint ventures to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
reserves for environmental remediation that management believes to be probable and estimable are recorded appropriately as current and long term liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the amounts charged to pre tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included in cost of goods sold and other charges income  net  and are summarized below dollars in millions balance at december  assumed remediation reserve from acquisition of solutia net charges taken cash reductions balance at december  the company acquisition of solutia resulted in a million increase to the company reserve for remediation costs and million in additional environmental asset retirement obligation costs 
included in the additional remediation reserve are costs associated with damages to natural resources 
the additional environmental remediation reserve includes costs of million and million related to the anniston  alabama and the sauget  illinois plant sites  respectively

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations additionally  costs of certain remediation projects included in the assumed environmental reserve are subject to a cost sharing arrangement with monsanto company monsanto under the provisions of the amended and restated settlement agreement effective february  the effective date  into which solutia entered with monsanto upon its emergence from bankruptcy the monsanto settlement agreement 
under the provisions of the monsanto settlement agreement  the company shares responsibility with monsanto for remediation at certain locations outside of the boundaries of plant sites in anniston  alabama and sauget  illinois the shared sites 
the company is responsible for the funding of environmental liabilities at the shared sites up to a total of million from the effective date 
if remediation costs for the shared sites exceed this amount  such costs will thereafter be shared equally between the company and monsanto 
including payments by solutia prior to its acquisition by eastman  million had been paid for costs at the shared sites as of december  as of december   an additional million has been accrued for estimated future remediation costs at the shared sites  over a period of thirty years 
in addition to remediation activities  the company establishes reserves for closure and postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains 
environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units  such as landfills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements 
these future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
the best estimate accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives for environmental asset retirement obligation costs was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company total environmental reserve for environmental contingencies  including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations  is recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows december  dollars in millions environmental contingent liabilities  current environmental contingent liabilities  long term total gaap requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation caro when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the company has performed an examination of various asset categories as of december  although it may have caros at certain of its facilities  including  but not limited to  the potential for asbestos abatement activities  the company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos 
the company continues to monitor these conditional obligations  as well as any new ones that may develop  and will recognize contingent liabilities associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs 
the accrued obligations do not have a material impact on the company consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
reserves related to environmental asset retirement obligations accounted for less than percent of the total environmental reserve at december  currently  the company environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next years 
if the company was to invest in numerous new environmental assets  or these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the company anticipated they would  the amortization on them would increase  and could have a material negative impact on the company financial condition and results of operations 
the company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote  and does not anticipate  based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation  that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
these amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities  but also included million and million in expenditures for engineering and construction in and  respectively 
expenditures in also included costs and expenditures in the second half of the year for sites acquired in the acquisition of solutia 
cash expenditures in  including expenditures for engineering and construction  are expected to increase primarily as a result of full year integration of the acquired solutia sites 
additionally  management anticipates that capital expenditures associated with the company approach to addressing recently finalized boiler air emissions regulations will modestly increase average annual environmental capital expenditures over the next five years compared to recent historical levels 
however  the company has decided to diversify by converting over the next three to six years percent of its steam and electric generation capacity at the kingsport  tennessee facility to natural gas  which management believes is a more cost efficient approach to compliance with air emissions regulations 
management does not believe that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated financial position or cash flows 
other than these planned capital expenditures at the company kingsport  tennessee facility  the company does not currently expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the company planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 
inflation in recent years  general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on eastman costs 
the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices  although derivative financial instruments are utilized  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market price fluctuations 
management expects the volatility of raw material and energy costs to continue and the company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects 
for additional information see note  derivatives  to the company consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board and international accounting standards board jointly issued amended accounting guidance to enhance disclosure requirements for instruments and transactions no longer eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after january  the company has concluded that no such netting has been in effect and that the change will have no impact on the company financial position or results of operations 
outlook eastman is focused on achieving consistent earnings growth through a market driven approach that takes advantage of the company existing technology platforms  global marketing and manufacturing presence  and leading positions in end markets 
this focus is supported by the company geographic and end market diversity as it serves global markets  including emerging economies with above average growth rates  and offers both original equipment manufacturing and after market products in a variety of end markets  such as transportation  building and construction  and consumables 
the company expects global growth in to be slightly above two percent  with the us remaining constant at two percent  europe approximately zero for the full year  and china near eight percent 
the company expects that market prices for commodity products and raw material and energy costs will continue to be volatile  and the company will continue to use pricing and hedging strategies to offset this volatility 
for  the company expects cash generated by operating activities of between billion and billion  capital spending to be approximately million  and its full year tax rate on reported earnings from continuing operations before income tax to be approximately percent

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based upon the foregoing expectations  despite persistent economic uncertainty  the company expects full year earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to be between and per share  excluding non recurring and non core costs  charges  or gains  which may include acquisition related costs and charges  asset impairments and restructuring charges  and mark to market pension and opeb gains or losses

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results 
the company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs 
these risk mitigation measures cannot eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations 
in addition  natural disasters  plant interruptions  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism  and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities  could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities 
the company could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to manufacturing operations or related infrastructure 
significant limitation on the company ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the company sales revenue  costs  results of operations  and financial condition

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant acquisitions expose the company to risks and uncertainties  the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the company business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the acquisition of large companies such as solutia subjects the company to a number of risks and uncertainties  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on eastman 
these include  but are not limited to that the financial performance of the acquired business may be significantly worse than expected  that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the company ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms  which may negatively impact the company liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives  that the company may not be able to achieve the cost  revenue  tax  or other synergies expected from any acquisition  or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies  that the company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business into eastman or that the integration efforts will not achieve the expected benefits  lost sales and customer dues to customer dissatisfaction with any transaction  loss of key employees from an acquired company  or assumption of unexpected or unknown liabilities

the company facilities and businesses are subject to complex health  safety and environmental laws and regulations  which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations 
the company accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based 
the amount accrued reflects the company assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  chemical control regulations  and testing requirements could result in higher costs 
pending and proposed us federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the company manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy  which legislation and regulation  if enacted  may result in capital expenditures  increases in costs for raw materials and energy  limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices  and other direct compliance costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk eastman chemical company eastman or the company has exposure to various market risks from changes in market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments  transacting in various foreign currencies  funding foreign operations  and acquiring and using certain commodities 
to mitigate the company exposure to these market risks  eastman has established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing its management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
the company determines its market risk exposure utilizing sensitivity analyses  which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or commodity prices 
the company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities  which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements 
from time to time  to manage the company mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively  the company enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
at december  and  these borrowings  investments  and swaps were predominately us dollar denominated 
the nature and amount of the company long term and short term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements  market conditions  and other factors 
for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  the company uses a one percent or less absolute shift in interest rates 
at december  and december   the market risk associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of one percent or less was approximately million and million  respectively 
this exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates 
the increase in over was primarily as a result of an increase in outstanding debt for the acquisition of solutia inc due to the company operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business 
the company manages most foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows it to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets 
therefore  weakness in one currency might be offset by strengths in others over time 
in order to mitigate foreign currency risk  the company from time to time enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated  but not yet committed  export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies  and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures 
it is the company policy to enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
at december   the market risk associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a percent adverse move in the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies was approximately million  with an additional million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates 
at december   the market risk associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a percent adverse move in the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies was approximately million  with an additional million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates 
since the company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions  a loss in fair value from those instruments is generally offset by an increase in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy 
to mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities  principally propane  natural gas  ethane  ethylene  and paraxylene  the company enters into option and forward contracts 
at december   the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstocks and natural gas  assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of percent  was million with less than an additional million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter 
at december   the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstocks and natural gas  assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of percent  was million  with less than an additional million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter
