our primary products are provided to workers employed by our customers and  as a result  our business prospects are dependent upon levels of employment among other factors 
our revenues are impacted by our customers opening and closing of locations and reductions and increases in headcount 
additionally  voluntary employee turnover has been reduced significantly as a result of fewer alternative jobs available to employees of our customers 
fewer available jobs coupled with less attrition results in decreased demand for our uniforms and service apparel 
our focus is geared towards mitigating these factors in the current economic environment and has included the following strategies 
first  we are actively pursuing acquisitions to increase our market share in the uniforms and related products segment and it is our intention to continue to seek additional acquisitions that fit into this segment in the future 
second  we diversified our business model to include the remote staffing solutions segment 
this business segment was started to provide these services for the company at a lower cost structure in order to improve our own operating results 
this segment  located in el salvador  belize  and the united states  has enabled us to reduce our operating expenses and to more effectively service our customers needs 
we added our belize location at the end of and eliminated our costa rica location at the same time 
the belize operation offers a more competitive cost structure for the company as compared to costa rica 
we began selling these services to other companies at the end of we have grown this business from approximately million in net sales to outside customers in to approximately million in net sales to outside customers in we spent significant effort in improving our management infrastructure in this segment to support significant growth in this segment in and beyond 
while net sales to outside customers for this segment increased during the full year  fourth quarter net sales to outside customers in this segment increased by 
we are aggressively marketing this service and we believe this sector will grow significantly in and beyond 
finally  we are pursuing new product lines to enhance our market position in the uniforms and related products segment 
toward this end  we entered into a licensing agreement in january of this licensing agreement provides us with access to patented technology which will allow us to market image apparel to our customers that will provide them with the ability to turn their uniforms from an expense item into point of sale advertisements that will  in turn  give them the ability to generate advertising revenues for their businesses 
although we believe that this new product line provides us with an opportunity for significant growth in our uniforms and related products segment in the future  we have not been able to generate any significant revenues from the product line during the last two years 
we have attempted to negotiate an extension of the initial term of the licensing agreement and are continuing to pursue this extension 
however  we have not been successful to this point and cannot be assured that we will ultimately be able to negotiate an extension on reasonable terms 
additionally  we have been involved in two significant test programs with two separate customers during one of these programs was with a major retailer in the northeast in the fourth quarter 
the test was adversely affected by hurricane sandy and as a result  the customer determined that it did not have sufficient data to conclude on moving forward with a full program 
we are in the process of developing another test program with this customer in additionally  while the feedback from the other test program has been positive  the customer has been slow to move to a full revenue producing program at this point 
as a result of these items and the lack of an extension of the initial term at this point  we concluded that we did not have adequate  verifiable cash flows to support recovery of the intangible asset on our statement of financial position at december  therefore  we recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of to write off the remaining balance of the licensing agreement 
during the latter part of  cotton prices began increasing dramatically and reached historical highs during due to weather related and other supply disruptions  which when combined with robust global demand  particularly in asia  created concerns about availability in addition to increased costs for our products 
while we were able to pass on a portion of these price increases to our customers during most of  we began to see a negative impact on our gross margins in the fourth quarter of this trend continued for us through the end of the third quarter of at which point we began to realize cost reductions as cotton prices began to stabilize 
our fourth quarter margins began to show improvement in comparison to the first three quarters of we expect to see continued improvement in our gross margins in our uniforms and related products segment in operations net sales change uniforms and related products remote staffing solutions net intersegment eliminations consolidated net sales net sales increased from  in to  in the increase in net sales is split between growth in our uniforms and related products segment and increases in net sales after intersegment eliminations from our remote staffing solutions segment 
intersegment eliminations reduce total net sales for sales of remote staffing solutions to the uniforms and related products segment by the remote staffing solutions segment 
uniforms and related products net sales increased in this increase is attributed to increased market penetration offset by continued softness in markets as the economic environment has remained challenging in remote staffing solutions net sales increased before intersegment eliminations and after intersegment eliminations in this growth is attributed to additional market penetration in as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold for our uniforms and related products segment was in  and in the percentage increase in as compared to is primarily attributed to an increase in direct product costs as a percentage of net sales during the current year due to higher raw material costs primarily related to shortages of cotton 
this increase was offset by a reduction in overhead costs as a percentage of sales as a result of higher volume in the current period 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold for our remote staffing solutions segment was in  and in the percentage increase in compared to is attributed primarily to increases in payroll related costs as a percentage of net sales for services provided to the uniforms and related products segment as a result of higher payroll related costs for these services without a corresponding increase in rates charged to the uniforms and related products segment 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses for our uniforms and related products segment approximated in and in the decrease as a percentage of sales is attributed primarily to the impact of higher net sales to cover operating expenses  lower incentive compensation expense as a result of lower earnings  a major consulting project completed in the second quarter of to study customer markets and refine our strategic plan to capitalize on the opportunities identified and reduced depreciation expense offset by increased costs associated with the company s pension plans and minor increases in various other costs 
as a result of the items discussed in the business outlook section above  we concluded that we did not have adequate  verifiable cash flows to support recovery of the intangible asset associated with our licensing agreement at december  therefore  we recognized a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of to write off the remaining balance of the licensing agreement 
this impairment charge is included in the results of our uniforms and related products segment 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses for our remote staffing solutions segment approximated in and in the decrease as a percentage of sales is attributed primarily to the impact of higher net sales to cover operating expenses  reduced bad debt expense in  offset by an increase in salaries  wages and benefits as the company staffed up to support future growth of this segment and increased outside broker fees as the company supplemented its internal sales efforts with independent brokers in and other miscellaneous increases 
the effective income tax rate in was and in was 
the increase in the effective tax rate is attributed primarily to the following a decrease in the benefit for untaxed foreign income  an increase in foreign income tax expense  an increase in the state income tax rate  an increase in the accrual for uncertain tax positions  an increase due to a non deductible portion of intangible asset impairment  an increase from the impact of permanent differences between book and tax basis earnings related to share based compensation  and an increase in the impact of other items 
during the years ended december  and  the company did not recognize deferred income taxes on foreign income of  and  respectively  due to the fact that these amounts are considered to be reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
based upon our current expectations  we do not expect to recognize deferred income taxes on our foreign income as this income is expected to be reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources the company uses a number of standards for its own purposes in measuring its liquidity  such as working capital  profitability ratios  long term debt as a percentage of long term debt and equity  and activity ratios 
the company s balance sheet is very strong at this point and provides the ability to pursue acquisitions  to invest in new product lines and technologies  and to invest in additional working capital as necessary 
we have a million revolving credit facility available for use in the event we should need it  under which no debt is outstanding at december  as of december   approximately  of our cash is held in our foreign subsidiaries and cannot be repatriated without recognizing and paying federal income taxes on this amount 
accounts receivable increased from  on december  to  as of december  the increase is primarily attributed to higher sales in the current period 
accounts receivable other decreased from  on december  to  as of december  as a result of lower receivables from our suppliers related to fabric inventories held at their locations 
as the severe cotton shortages in have subsided  we have reduced the amount of fabric required to be held at these suppliers 
inventories decreased from  on december  to  as of december  as previously discussed  the company increased raw material inventories during in order to protect its customers from potential shortages of cotton fabrics 
we believe we reached sufficient levels to achieve this objective for our inventories and have been able to reduce the levels accordingly in other intangible assets decreased from  to  this decrease is due to normal amortization expense of  and an impairment charge of  to write off the remaining balance of the licensing agreement discussed above 
the normal amortization above included  of amortization associated with the licensing agreement and as such  the amortization expense for the remaining intangible asset will be significantly lower 
accounts payable increased from  on december  to  on december  this increase is primarily due to the timing of purchases of inventory at year end compared to other current liabilities decreased from  on december  to  on december   due primarily to reduced accruals for incentive compensation as a result of lower earnings in long term pension liability increased from  on december  to  on december  the increase in this liability is primarily attributed to actuarial losses in the current period of approximately  and current year interest cost of  offset by current year returns on assets of  at december   the working capital of the company was approximately  and the working capital ratio was at december   the working capital of the company was approximately  and the working capital ratio was the company has operated without hindrance or restraint with its present working capital  believing that income generated from operations and outside sources of credit  both trade and institutional  are more than adequate to fund the company s operations 
the company has an on going capital expenditure program designed to maintain and improve its facilities

during the years ended december  and  the company paid cash dividends of approximately  and  respectively  resulting from quarterly dividends of per share and a special dividend of in on december   the company paid the special dividend of per share representing a prepayment and payment in lieu of the company s anticipated regular quarterly dividend for in order to take advantage of a tax efficient method to return capital to our shareholders prior to anticipated increases in tax rates associated with dividends

the company reacquired and retired  shares and  shares of its common stock in the years ended december  and  respectively  with approximate costs of  and  respectively 
at december   the company had  shares remaining for purchase under its common stock repurchase authorization 
shares purchased under the share repurchase program are constructively retired and returned to unissued status 
we consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases  including among other things  our cost of equity  our after tax cost of borrowing  our debt to total capitalization targets and our expected future cash needs 
there is no expiration date or other restriction governing the period over which we can make our share repurchases under the program 
the company anticipates that it will continue to pay dividends and that it will repurchase additional shares of its common stock in the future as financial conditions permit 
in  cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately   in cash was provided by operating activities   was used in investing activities consisting of net capital expenditures  and  was used in financing activities 
financing activities included the payment of cash dividends  as discussed above   of debt reduction and common stock reacquired and retired of  offset by net proceeds from exercises of stock options of  on june   the company entered into a three year credit agreement with fifth third bank that made available to the company up to  on a revolving credit basis 
interest is payable at libor rounded up to the next th of plus based upon the one month libor rate for us dollar based borrowings at december  
the company pays an annual commitment fee of on the average unused portion of the commitment 
the available balance under the credit agreement is reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   there were no balances outstanding under letters of credit 
the revolving credit agreement expires on june  at the option of the company  any outstanding balance on the agreement at that date will convert to a one year term loan 
we anticipate we will be able to renew or replace the agreement before its expiration 
the credit agreement with fifth third bank contains restrictive provisions concerning liabilities to tangible net worth ratios  other borrowings  and a fixed charges coverage ratio 
the company is in full compliance with all terms  conditions and covenants of the credit agreement 
with funds from the credit agreement  anticipated cash flows generated from operations and other credit sources readily available  the company believes that its liquidity is satisfactory  its working capital adequate and its capital resources sufficient for funding its ongoing capital expenditure program and its operations  including planned expansion for off balance sheet arrangements the company does not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any interest in variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are those that we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions is as follows allowance for losses on accounts receivable these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
an additional impairment in value of one percent of net accounts receivable would require an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and would result in additional expense of approximately  the company s concentration of risk is also monitored and at year end  no customer had an account balance greater than of receivables and the five largest customer account balances totaled  additionally  the company advances funds for certain of its suppliers to purchase raw materials 
the company deducts payment for these raw materials from payments made to the suppliers upon completion of the related finished goods 
the company had a receivables balance from one of its suppliers located in haiti totaling approximately  at december  this amount is included in accounts receivable other on the consolidated balance sheet 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
insurance the company self insures for certain obligations related to health insurance programs 
the company also purchases stop loss insurance policies to protect it from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
the company estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
the company liabilities are based on estimates  and  while the company believes that the accrual for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
changes in claim experience  the company ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
pensions the company s pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rates used for the company s pension plans of to were determined based on the citigroup pension yield curve 
this rate was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the plans 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  while a reduction in the discount rate of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately  and would have reduced the funded status by  for the company s defined benefit pension plans 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
income taxes the company is required to estimate and record income taxes payable for federal  state and foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal and state tax matters for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
federal income taxes are not provided on that portion of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
for the year ending december   we recognized a net increase in total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately  as of december   we had an accrued liability of  for unrecognized tax benefits 
we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense  and the related liability is included inother long term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
share based compensation the company recognizes expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in the financial statements based on their fair values 
share based compensation expense that was recorded in and includes the compensation expense for the share based payments granted in those years 
in the company s share based compensation strategy we utilize a combination of stock options and stock appreciation rights sars that fully vest on the date of grant 
therefore  the fair value of the options and sars granted is recognized as expense on the date of grant 
the company used the black scholes merton valuation model to value any share based compensation 
option valuation methods  including black scholes merton  require the input of assumptions including the risk free interest rate  dividend rate  expected term and volatility rate 
the company determines the assumptions to be used based upon current economic conditions 
the impact of changing any of the individual assumptions by would not have a material impact on the recorded expense
