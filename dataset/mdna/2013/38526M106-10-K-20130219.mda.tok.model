table of contents part i item business overview we are a regionally accredited provider of postsecondary education services focused on offering graduate and undergraduate degree programs in our core disciplines of education  healthcare  business  and liberal arts 
we offer programs online  on ground at our approximately acre traditional campus in phoenix  arizona  and onsite at facilities we lease and at facilities owned by third party employers 
we are committed to providing an academically rigorous educational experience with a focus on professionally relevant programs that meet the objectives of our students 
we utilize an integrated  innovative approach to marketing  recruiting  and retaining students  which has enabled us to increase enrollment to approximately  students at december  at december   of our students were enrolled in our online programs  and  of our online and professional studies students  were pursuing masters or doctoral degrees 
at december   our ground enrollment was approximately  as a principal part of our business  we focus on educating working adults  whom we define as students age or older who are pursuing a degree while employed 
as of december   approximately of our online and professional studies students were age or older 
we believe that working adults are attracted to the convenience and flexibility of our online programs because they can study and interact with faculty and classmates during times that suit their schedules 
we also believe that working adults  particularly those who have some college experience  represent an attractive student population because they are better able to finance their education  more readily recognize the benefits of a postsecondary degree  and have higher persistence and completion rates than students generally 
in  we continued to increase the number of students in attendance at our expanding traditional ground campus 
we believe our strong campus presence in arizona is a key branding tool that is attractive to many students 
we are able to provide traditional ground students an opportunity to earn an education at a private  christian oriented university at rates equivalent to those of a state funded university 
we plan to increase enrollment growth for our traditional campus over the next few years  and seek to have  traditional ground students in attendance at the beginning of our academic year 
in november  we accepted an invitation to become a member of the division i western athletic conference beginning with the academic year  and in we will begin a four year process to reclassify our ncaa membership from division ii to division i 
during the reclassification process we will be considered a division i university and play full conference schedules but will be ineligible to compete for national championships which  for example  precludes us from playing in the end of year ncaa basketball tournament during that period of time 
we have experienced significant growth in enrollment  net revenue  and operating income over the last several years 
our enrollment at december  was approximately  representing an increase of approximately over our enrollment at december  our net revenue and operating income for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  over the year ended december  our net revenue and operating income for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  over the year ended december  we seek to achieve continued growth in a manner that reinforces our reputation for providing academically rigorous  professionally relevant educational programs that advance the educations and careers of our students

in addition  we have specialized accreditations for certain programs from the association of collegiate business schools and programs  the commission on collegiate nursing education  and the commission on accreditation of athletic training education 
in addition  we are a candidate for accreditation by the national council for accreditation of teacher education ncate 
we believe that our institution wide state authorization and regional accreditation  together with these specialized accreditations  reflect the quality of our programs  enhance their marketability  and improve the employability of our graduates 

table of contents history grand canyon college was founded in prescott  arizona in as a traditional  private  non profit college and moved to its existing campus in phoenix  arizona in established as a baptist affiliated institution with a strong emphasis on religious studies  the school initially focused on offering bachelor s degree programs in education 
over the years  the school expanded its curricula to include programs in the sciences  nursing  business  music  and arts 
the college obtained regional accreditation in from the commission on institutions of higher education  north central association of colleges and schools  the predecessor to the higher learning commission  and began offering nursing programs and master s degree programs in education and business in the s 
in  it achieved university status and became grand canyon university 
the university introduced its first distance learning programs in  and launched its first online programs in in business and education 
in early  it discontinued its baptist affiliation and became a non denominational christian university 
in late  the school s board of trustees initiated a process to evaluate alternatives as a result of the school s poor financial condition and  in february  a group of investors acquired the assets of the school and converted the school into a for profit institution 
our approach to academic quality some of the key elements that we focus on to promote a high level of academic quality include academically rigorous  professionally relevant curricula 
we create academically rigorous curricula that are designed to enable all students to gain the foundational knowledge  professional competencies  and demonstrable skills required to be successful in their chosen fields 
our curriculum is designed and delivered by faculty and industry specific subject matter experts that are committed to high quality  rigorous education and professional preparedness 
we design our curricula to address specific objectives that pre career and working adult students need and are seeking 
through this combination  we believe that we produce graduates that can compete with integrity and become leaders in their chosen fields 
qualified faculty 
we demonstrate our commitment to high quality education by hiring qualified faculty with relevant practical experience 
substantially all of our current faculty members hold at least a master s degree in their respective fields and approximately of our faculty members hold doctoral degrees 
faculty members are able to integrate pertinent and useful experiences from their professional careers into the courses they teach 
we invest in the professional development of our faculty members by providing training in traditional and online teaching techniques  hosting events and discussion forums that foster sharing of best practices  and continually assessing teaching effectiveness through assessment  peer reviews  and student evaluations 
centralized program design and curriculum development 
we employ a highly collaborative curriculum development process to ensure a consistent learning experience with frequent faculty student interaction in our courses 
we thereafter continuously review our programs in an effort to ensure that they remain consistent  up to date  relevant  and effective in producing the desired learning outcomes 
we also regularly review student surveys to identify opportunities for course modifications and upgrades 
effective student services 
we establish teams comprised of enrollment  academic and finance personnel that act as the primary support contact point for each of our students  beginning at the application stage and continuing through graduation 
in recent years  we have also concentrated on improving the technology used to support student learning  including delivering a new online learning platform and further improving student services through the implementation of online interfaces 
as a result  many of our support services  including academic  administrative  library  and career services  are accessible online  generally allowing users to access these services at a time and in a manner that is convenient to them 
continual academic oversight 
we have centralized the assessment functions for all of our programs through our office of assessment  which continuously evaluates the desired learning outcomes for each of our programs 
we continuously assess outcomes data to determine whether our students graduate with the knowledge  competencies  and skills that are necessary to succeed in the workplace 
the office of assessment also initiates and manages periodic examinations of our curricula by internal and external reviewers to evaluate and verify program quality and workplace applicability 
based on these processes and student feedback  we determine whether to modify or discontinue programs that do not meet our standards or market needs  or to create new programs 
the office of assessment also oversees assessment of mission based competencies 

table of contents we also offer the following features in an effort to enrich the academic experience of current and prospective students flexibility in program delivery 
we seek to meet market demands by providing students with the flexibility to take courses exclusively online or to combine online coursework with various campus and onsite options 
for example  based on market demand  particularly in connection with our nursing programs  we have established satellite locations at multiple hospitals that allow nursing students to take clinical courses onsite while completing other course work online 
we have established similar onsite arrangements with other major employers  including schools and school districts through which students can pursue student teaching opportunities 
this flexibility raises our profile among employers  encourages students to take and complete courses  and eliminates inconveniences that tend to lessen student persistence 
small class size 
at december   of our online and professional studies classes had or fewer students 
these class sizes provide each student with the opportunity to interact directly with course faculty and to receive individualized feedback and attention while also affording our faculty with the opportunity to engage proactively with a manageable number of students 
we believe this interaction enhances the academic quality of our programs by promoting opportunities for students to participate actively and thus build the requisite knowledge  competencies  and skills 
accreditation and program approvals we believe that the quality of our academic programs is evidenced by our college and program specific accreditations and approvals 
grand canyon university has been continuously accredited by the higher learning commission and its predecessor since  most recently obtaining reaccreditation in for the ten year period through we are licensed in arizona by the arizona state board for private postsecondary education

table of contents we have established relationships with health care systems  school districts  emergency services providers  and other employers through which we offer programs onsite to provide flexibility and convenience to students and their employers 
for example  for our nursing programs  we offer clinical courses onsite at hospitals and other health care centers with which we have partnerships  and also arrange to allow these students to complete their clinical work onsite 
we currently offer our ground based programs to traditional students through three week semesters in a calendar year and to online students in five  seven or eight week courses throughout the calendar year 
traditional students generally enroll in three or four courses per semester while online students typically concentrate on one course at a time 
we require our online students to be actively engaged in their online student classroom at least three or four times each week  depending on the content and degree level of the class  in order to maintain an active dialogue with their professors and classmates 
our online programs provide a digital record of student interactions for the course instructor to assess students levels of engagement and demonstration of required competencies 
new program development we typically investigate market demand and review proposals developed by faculty  staff  students  alumni  or partners to aid us in the identification of potentially new degree programs or emphasis areas 
we then perform an analysis of the consistency of the proposed program or emphasis with our mission  long term demand  and development costs 
if  following this analysis  the business development committee decides to proceed with a new program  our college faculty and administrators approve subject matter experts with whom our curriculum design and development team members  including instructional designers  curriculum developers  and editors  work to design the program so that it is consistent with our academically rigorous  professionally oriented program standards 
the program is then reviewed by the dean of the applicable college  the program standards and evaluation committee  the academic affairs committee  and finally  our provost and chief academic officer 
upon accreditation and regulatory approval  the subject matter experts develop course syllabi  and our marketing department creates a marketing plan to publicize the new program 
our average program development process is six months from proposal to course introduction 
the development process is typically longer if we are expanding into a new field or offering a new level of degree 
assessment our office of assessment serves as our central resource for measuring learning outcomes and student satisfaction and driving systematically engineered and data driven continuous improvement cycles for updating our curricula 
among other things  the assessment team reviews student course satisfaction surveys  analyzes archived student assignments to assess whether a given program is developing students foundational knowledge  professional competencies  and skills to achieve the expected learning outcomes  and provides feedback as to program effectiveness 
based on this data and the conclusions of the assessment team  we modify programs as necessary to meet our student satisfaction and educational development standards 
faculty our faculty includes full time faculty and adjunct faculty whom we employ to teach on a course by course basis for a specified fee 
during our fall semester  of the seats on our ground traditional campus were taught by full time faculty with the remaining seats taught by adjunct faculty 
our intention is that the percentage of seats taught by full time faculty will increase to of all seats by the fall semester of in the fourth quarter of  of our students in online classes were taught by full time faculty 
this increased to in the fourth quarter of the remaining courses are primarily taught by adjunct faculty 
our current faculty members hold at least a master s degree in their respective fields and approximately of our faculty members hold doctoral degrees 
we believe that the quality of our faculty is critical to our success  particularly because faculty members have more interaction with our students than any other university employee 
accordingly  we regularly review the performance of our faculty  including  but not limited to  engaging our full time faculty and other specialists to conduct peer reviews of our adjunct faculty  monitoring the amount of contact and the quality of feedback that faculty have with students in our online programs  reviewing student feedback  and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students 
if we determine that a faculty member is not performing at the level that we require  we work with the faculty member to improve performance  including  among other things  assigning him or her a mentor or through other means 
if the faculty member s performance does not improve  we terminate the faculty member s contract and employment

we target our online programs to working adults focused on program quality  convenience  and career advancement goals 
we target our ground programs to traditional college students  working adults seeking a high quality education in a traditional college setting  and working adults seeking to take classes with a cohort onsite at our leased facilities or at their employer s facility 
in marketing our programs to prospective students  we emphasize the value of the educational experience and the academic rigor and professional relevancy of the programs  as well as the cost of the program 
we believe this approach reinforces the qualities that we want associated with our brand and also attracts students who tend to be more persistent in starting and finishing their programs 
recruitment 
once a prospective student has indicated an interest in enrolling in one of our programs  our lead management system identifies and directs an enrollment counselor to initiate immediate communication 
the enrollment counselor serves as the primary  direct contact for the prospective student and the counselor s goal is to help that individual gain sufficient knowledge and understanding of our programs so that he or she can assess whether there is a good match between our offerings and the prospective student s goals 
upon the prospective student s submission of an application  the enrollment counselor  together with our student services personnel  works with the applicant to gain acceptance  arrange financial aid  if needed  register for courses  and prepare for matriculation

a student being considered for such admission may be asked to submit additional information such as personal references and an essay addressing academic history 
students may also need to schedule an interview to help clarify academic goals and help us make an informed decision 

table of contents retention 
a key component in retaining our students is providing an outstanding learning experience 
we feel that our team based  proactive approach to recruitment and enhanced student services results in increased retention due to our systematic approach to contacting students at key milestones during their enrollment  providing encouragement and highlighting their achievements 
our financial advisors proactively assist each student with the student s selection of an appropriate payment option  and monitor the student s progress and account balance to ensure a smooth financial aid experience and to help ensure our students are well prepared for the financial obligations they incur 
our academic advisors assist students with their academic schedules and regularly monitor triggering events  such as the failure to participate in the classroom or failure to matriculate in a timely manner  which signal that a student may be at risk for dropping out 
upon identifying an at risk student  academic advisors proactively interact with the student to resolve any issues and encourage the student to continue with his or her program 
we have found that personally involving our employees in the student educational process  and proactively seeking to resolve issues before they become larger problems  can significantly increase retention rates among students 
these frequent interactions between financial and academic advisors and students are a key component to our retention strategy 
enrollment at december   we had  students enrolled in our courses  of which  or  were enrolled in our online programs  and  or  were enrolled in our ground programs 
of our students in online programs  which were geographically distributed throughout all states of the united states  and canada  and in professional studies programs  were age or older 
of our traditional on campus students  were under age and  although we draw students from throughout the united states  a substantial majority were from arizona

tuition and fees for the academic year the academic year that began in may  our prices per credit hour range from to for undergraduate online and professional studies courses  to for graduate online courses  for doctoral online programs  and for undergraduate courses for ground students 
for our active duty and active reserve online and professional studies students  our prices per credit hour are for undergraduate  for graduate courses and for doctoral courses 
the overall price of each course varies based upon the number of credit hours per course with most courses representing four credit hours  the degree level of the program  and the discipline 
in addition  we charge a fixed  block tuition for undergraduate ground students taking between and credit hours per semester  with an additional per credit hour for credits in excess of a traditional undergraduate degree typically requires a minimum of credit hours 
the minimum number of credit hours required for a master s degree and overall cost for such a degree varies by program  although such programs typically require approximately credit hours 
the doctoral program requires approximately credit hours 

table of contents based on current tuition rates  tuition for a full program would generally equate to between  and  for an online master s program  between  and  for a full four year online bachelor s program   and  for a full doctoral program  and approximately  for a full four year bachelor s program taken on our ground campus 
the tuition amounts referred to above assume no reductions for transfer credits or scholarships  which many of our students utilize to reduce their total program costs 
for the years ended december   and  our revenue was reduced by approximately million  million and million  respectively  as a result of scholarships that we offered to our students 
the increase in scholarships reflects our increased revenues and our resulting increased use of scholarships especially academic scholarships  to attract high performing students to our ground traditional campus 
we have established a refund policy for tuition and fees based upon individual course start dates 
under our policy  for courses offered through a non traditional modality  generally if a student drops or withdraws from a course before the course begins  of the charges for tuition and fees are refunded 
if a student drops or withdraws from a course during the first week of the course  of the charges for tuition are refunded 
if a student drops or withdraws from a course during or after the second week of a course  tuition charges and fees are not refunded 
all fees  including materials fees  are non refundable for non traditional students after the start of a course 
we will refund tuition and fees according to the above policy unless a student attending courses online is a resident of a state that requires us to comply with different  state specific guidelines 
for traditional students attending week courses  generally if a student withdraws before the course begins  of the charges for tuition and fees are refunded

if a student drops during the third week of a course  of the tuition charges are refunded and during or after the fourth week  there are no refunds for tuition charges 
fees charged by us include graduation fees as well as fees for access to certain educational resources such as online materials 
this tuition and fees refund policy is different from  and applies in addition to  the return of title iv funds policy we are required to follow as a condition of our participation in the title iv programs 
sources of student financing our students finance their education through a combination of methods  as follows title iv programs 
the federal government provides for grants and loans to students under the title iv programs  and students can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible by the department of education 
student financial aid under the title iv programs is primarily awarded on the basis of a student s financial need  which is generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount the student and the student s family can reasonably contribute to that cost 
all students receiving title iv program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study 
in addition  each school must ensure that title iv program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students 
during fiscal and  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues calculated on a cash basis in accordance with department of education standards currently in effect from tuition financed under the title iv programs 
the primary title iv programs that our students receive funding from are the federal direct loan program or fdl program  and the federal pell grant  or pell  program 
student loans administered through the fdl program are currently the most significant source of us federal student aid 
there are two types of federal student loans subsidized loans  which are based on the us federal statutory calculation of student need  and unsubsidized loans  which are not need based 
neither type of student loan is based on creditworthiness although annual and aggregate loan limits apply based on a student s grade level 
students are not responsible for interest on subsidized loans while the student is enrolled in school 
students are responsible for the interest on unsubsidized loans while enrolled in school  but have the option to defer payment while enrolled 
repayment on federal student loans begins six months after the date the student ceases to be enrolled 
the loans are repayable over the course of years and  in some cases  longer 
both graduate and undergraduate students are eligible for loans 
during  federal student loans both subsidized and unsubsidized represented approximately of the gross title iv funds that we received 
grants under the pell program pell grants are awarded based on need and only to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor s or professional degree 
unlike loans  pell grants are not repayable 
during fiscal year  pell grants represented approximately of the gross title iv funds that we received 
the eligibility requirements for  and the maximum amount available under  pell grants increased in  but did not increase in over levels 
for the award year  the maximum amount available under pell grants was maintained but the maximum income that makes an applicant for title iv program funds eligible for an automatic zero expected family contribution was reduced from  to  our students also receive funding under other title iv programs  including the federal perkins loan program  the federal supplemental educational opportunity grant program  the federal work study program  the national science and mathematics access to retain talent grant program  the academic competitiveness grant program  and the teacher education assistance for college and higher education grant program 
other financial aid programs 
in addition to the title iv programs listed above  eligible students may participate in several other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental sources 
these include veterans educational benefits administered by the us department of veterans affairs and state financial aid programs 
during fiscal and  we derived an immaterial amount of our net revenue from tuition financed by such programs 

table of contents private loans 
some of our students also use private loan programs to help finance their education 
students can apply to a number of different lenders for private loans at current market interest rates 
private loans are intended to fund a portion of students cost of education not covered by the title iv programs and other financial aid 
during fiscal and  payments derived from private loans constituted less than of our net revenues for each year  respectively 
other sources 
we derived the remainder of our net revenue from tuition that is self funded or attributable to employer tuition reimbursements 
technology systems and management we believe that we have established secure  reliable  scalable technology systems that provide a high quality online educational environment and that give us the capability to substantially grow our online and traditional programs and enrollment 
online course delivery and management 
historically  we have used the angel learning management suite as our online learning management system 
angel is a web based system and collaboration portal that stores  manages  and delivers course content  provides interactive communication between students and faculty  enables assignment uploading  and supplies online evaluation tools 
the system also provides centralized administration features that support the implementation of policies for content format and in classroom learning tools 
during  we entered into an agreement with an affiliated entity to develop a new learning management system for our use 
through this agreement  we prepaid perpetual license fees  acquired source code rights for the software developed  and prepaid maintenance and service fees for the first seven years of use  for an aggregate amount of million 
we began converting our students to this new learning management platform  called loudcloud  in october of by august of all online nontraditional students had migrated to the loudcloud platform 
we anticipate the remaining ground students and cohorts will fully transition by august of internal administration 
we utilize a commercial customer relations management package to distribute  manage  track  and report on all interactions with prospective student leads as well as all active and inactive students 
this package is scalable to capacity levels well in excess of current requirements 
we also utilize a commercial software package to track title iv funds  student records  grades  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
infrastructure 
we operate two data centers  one at our campus and one at another phoenix area location 
all of our servers are networked and we have redundant data backup 
we manage our technology environment internally 
our wide area network uses fully redundant sonet ring technology to ensure maximum uptime  bandwidth capacity and network performance while allowing the flexibility needed to bring on additional data centers and remote sites as needed 
student access is load balanced for maximum performance 
real time monitoring provides current system status across server  network  and storage components 
ground campus we own our ground campus  which is located on approximately acres in the center of the phoenix  arizona metropolitan area  near downtown phoenix 
our on campus facilities currently consist of classroom buildings  four lecture halls  a seat theater  a  volume library  a media arts complex that provides communications students with audio and video equipment  a  square foot recreation center for both student athletes and on campus students  a  square foot  seat basketball and entertainment arena  a gymnasium  an activity center that contains a food court  a bowling alley and other student services  a student union  five dormitories  apartments  athletic facilities and a parking garage with  parking spaces 
additionally  we have several office buildings used for administration  including a recently renovated office complex adjacent to our campus 
in  in order to accommodate the continued growth of our traditional ground population  we expect to build two dormitories and to renovate our food service facilities and library 
we have intercollegiate athletic teams that currently compete in division ii of the national collegiate athletic association ncaa 
our athletic facilities include the university arena a  seat venue for all men s and women s basketball games plus select other gcu athletic competitions  concerts  speakers and other events  and a competition practice gymnasium  which accommodates basketball  volleyball  and wrestling competitive events 
in addition  the university s  square foot student recreation center has state of the art training facilities for our student athletes plus practice space and locker rooms for men s and women s basketball and wrestling 
our baseball  softball  track and field  soccer and lacrosse programs utilize on campus practice and competition sites 
golf  tennis  cross country and swimming programs utilize off campus sites for practice and competition 
we won the learfield sports directors cup as the top overall ncaa division ii intercollegiate athletic program based on the combined success in all of the sports we competed in 
in the year  our men s indoor track and field team won the ncaa division ii national championship and of our sports teams advanced into ncaa postseason competition 
historically  our baseball program has produced major league baseball players while the men s basketball program has produced a pair of nba players 
baseball  basketball  tennis and soccer have combined to produce nine national association of intercollegiate athletics naia or ncaa national championship teams in prior years 
in november  we accepted an invitation to become a member of the division i western athletic conference beginning with the academic year  and in we will begin a four year process to reclassify our ncaa membership from division ii to division i 
during the reclassification process we will be considered a division i university and play full conference schedules but will be ineligible to compete for national championships which  for example  precludes us from playing in the end of year ncaa basketball tournament during that period of time 

table of contents we believe our ground based programs and traditional campus not only offer our ground students  faculty  and staff an opportunity to participate in a traditional college experience  but also provide our online students  faculty  and staff with a sense of connection to a traditional university 
additionally  our full time ground faculty play an important role in integrating online faculty into our academic programs and ensuring the overall consistency and quality of the ground and online student experience 
we believe the mix of our online program with our traditional ground based program with a greater than year history and heritage differentiates us from other for profit postsecondary education providers 
we intend to continue to expand the size and enhance the profile and reputation of our ground campus by  among other things  adding faculty  expanding upon and modernizing our campus infrastructure and technological capabilities and  over the next several years  potentially adding additional locations in the southwest united states to attract students who would like to participate in our traditional campus experience but do not want to relocate to phoenix  arizona 
these activities may require significant capital expenditures 
employees in addition to our faculty  as of december   we employed approximately  staff and administrative personnel in university services  academic advising and academic support  enrollment services  university administration  financial aid  information technology  human resources  corporate accounting  finance  and other administrative functions 
none of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us 
we consider our relationships with our employees to be good 
competition there are more than  us colleges and universities serving traditional and adult students 
competition is highly fragmented and varies by geography  program offerings  modality  ownership  quality level  and selectivity of admissions 
no one institution has a significant share of the total postsecondary market 
our ground program competes with arizona state university  northern arizona university  and the university of arizona  the in state public universities  as well as two year colleges within the state community college system 
our ground program also competes with geographically proximate universities with similar religious heritages  including azusa pacific university  baylor university  and pepperdine university 
our online programs compete with local  traditional universities geographically located near each of our prospective students  and with other for profit postsecondary schools that offer online degrees  particularly those schools that offer online graduate programs within our core disciplines  including capella university  university of phoenix  and walden university 
in addition  many public and private schools  colleges  and universities  including major colleges and universities such as arizona state university  offer online programs 
non profit institutions receive substantial government subsidies  and have access to government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for profit schools 
accordingly  non profit institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for profit sector 
in addition  some of our competitors  including both traditional colleges and universities and other for profit schools  have substantially greater name recognition and financial resources than we have  which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students 
we also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market  including established colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs 
we believe that the competitive factors in the postsecondary education market include availability of professionally relevant and accredited program offerings  the types of degrees offered and the marketability of those degrees  reputation  regulatory approvals  and compliance history of the school  convenient  flexible and dependable access to programs and classes  qualified and experienced faculty  quality of the ground campus facilities  level of student support services  cost of the program  marketing and selling effectiveness  and the time necessary to earn a degree

table of contents regulation we are subject to extensive regulation by state education agencies  accrediting commissions  and the federal government through the department of education under the higher education act 
the regulations  standards  and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations  including our educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations  athletics and financial condition 
as an institution of higher education that grants degrees and certificates  we are required to be authorized by appropriate state education authorities 
these state education authorities also exercise regulatory oversight of our institution 
in addition  in order to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  we must be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the department of education 
accreditation is a non governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions  based on the standards of the accrediting commission and the stated aims and purposes of the institution 
the higher education act requires accrediting commissions recognized by the department of education to review and monitor many aspects of an institution s operations and to take appropriate action if the institution fails to meet the accrediting commission s standards 
our operations are also subject to regulation by the department of education due to our participation in the federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act 
those title iv programs include educational loans with below market interest rates that are issued by the federal government under the federal direct loan program the fdl program  as well as grant programs for students with demonstrated financial need 
to participate in the title iv programs  a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agency or agencies  be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the department of education  and be certified as an eligible institution by the department of education 
our business activities are planned and implemented to comply with the standards of these regulatory agencies 
we employ a vice president of student financial aid compliance who is knowledgeable about regulatory matters relevant to student financial aid programs and our chief financial officer  chief compliance officer  and general counsel also provide oversight designed to ensure that we meet the requirements of our regulated operating environment 
state education licensure and regulation we are authorized to offer our educational programs by the arizona state board for private postsecondary education  the regulatory agency governing private postsecondary educational institutions in the state of arizona  where we are located 
we do not presently have campuses in any states other than arizona 
we are required by the higher education act to maintain authorization from the arizona state board for private postsecondary education in order to participate in the title iv programs 
this authorization is very important to us and our business 
to maintain our state authorization  we must continuously meet standards relating to  among other things  educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  marketing and recruitment  financial operations  addition of new locations and educational programs  and various operational and administrative procedures 
our failure to comply with the requirements of the arizona state board for private postsecondary education could result in us losing our authorization to offer our educational programs  which would cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs and could force us to cease operations 
alternatively  the arizona state board for private postsecondary education could restrict our ability to offer certain degree and non degree programs 
most other states impose regulatory requirements on out of state educational institutions operating within their boundaries  such as those having a physical facility or conducting certain academic activities within the state 
state laws establish standards in areas such as instruction  qualifications of faculty  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations  and other operational matters  some of which are different than the standards prescribed by the department of education or the arizona state board for private postsecondary education 
laws in some states limit schools ability to offer educational programs and award degrees to residents of those states 
some states also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the department of education  and many require the posting of surety bonds 
several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that have some activity in the state  such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state  employing faculty who reside in the state  or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state 
in july  the department of education announced that it will no longer enforce a requirement that distance education programs obtain permission to operate in every state in which they enroll at least one student  which it had adopted in the department of education s announcement followed the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit s ruling that vacated the requirement on procedural grounds 
while the department of education will no longer seek to enforce applicable state law requirements  educational institutions will still need permission to operate in their home states and have to comply with state laws on authorization 
see regulation of federal student financial aid programs state authorization 
because state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states  are not well developed in many states  are imprecise or unclear in some states  and can change frequently  it is unclear how the new department of education regulation will be enforced and what impact it will have on us 
new laws  regulations  or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could also increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states  which could  in turn  negatively affect enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the applicable state education agency in those states and we have obtained such licensure or authorization 
in other states  we have obtained approvals as we have determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities or where we have determined that our licensure or authorization can facilitate the teaching certification process in a particular state for graduates of our college of education 
we review the licensure or authorization requirements of other states when appropriate to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization by the applicable state education agencies 
because state regulatory requirements  including agency interpretations  can change frequently  and because we enroll students in all states and the district of columbia  we expect that state regulatory authorities in states where we are not currently licensed or authorized will request that we seek licensure or authorization in their states in the future 
although we believe that we will be able to comply with additional state licensing or authorization requirements that may arise or be asserted in the future  if we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a state  or fail to obtain licenses or authorizations when required  we could lose our state license or authorization by that state or be subject to other sanctions  including restrictions on our activities in  and fines and penalties imposed by  that state  as well as fines  penalties  and sanctions imposed by the department of education 
while we do not believe that any of the states in which we are currently licensed or authorized  other than arizona  are individually material to our operations  the loss of licensure or authorization in any state could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state  which could significantly reduce our enrollments 
state professional licensure many states have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in specified fields  including fields such as education and healthcare 
these requirements vary by state and by field 
a student s success in obtaining licensure following graduation typically depends on several factors  including the background and qualifications of the individual graduate  as well as the following factors  among others whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure  or by a professional association  whether the program from which the student graduated meets all requirements for professional licensure in that state  whether the institution and the program are accredited and  if so  by what accrediting commissions  and whether the institution s degrees are recognized by other states in which a student may seek to work 
many states also require that graduates pass a state test or examination as a prerequisite to becoming certified in certain fields  such as teaching and nursing 
many states will certify individuals if they have already been certified in another state 
our college of education is approved by the arizona state board of education to offer institutional recommendations credentials for the certification of elementary  secondary  and special education teachers and school administrators 
our college of nursing and health care professions is approved by the arizona state board of nursing for the bachelor of science in nursing and master of science in nursing degrees 
due to varying requirements for professional licensure and certification in states other than arizona  we inform students of the risks associated with obtaining professional licensure or certification and that it is each student s responsibility to determine what state  local or professional licensure and certification requirements are necessary in his or her individual state 
accreditation we have been continuously accredited since by the higher learning commission and its predecessor  each a regional accrediting commission recognized by the department of education 
our accreditation was reaffirmed in for a ten year period  and the next scheduled comprehensive evaluation will be conducted in accreditation is a private  non governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance  governance  integrity  educational quality  faculty  physical resources  administrative capability and resources  and financial stability 
to be recognized by the department of education  accrediting commissions must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions  conduct peer review evaluations of institutions  and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria 
an accredited school is subject to periodic review by its accrediting commissions to determine whether it continues to meet the performance  integrity and quality required for accreditation 
there are six regional accrediting commissions recognized by the department of education  each with a specified geographic scope of coverage  which together cover the entire united states 
most traditional  public and private non profit  degree granting colleges and universities are accredited by one of these six regional accrediting commissions 
the higher learning commission  which accredits grand canyon university  is the same regional accrediting commission that accredits such universities as the university of arizona  arizona state university  and other degree granting public  private non profit  and proprietary colleges and universities in the states of arizona  arkansas  colorado  illinois  indiana  iowa  kansas  michigan  minnesota  missouri  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  ohio  oklahoma  south dakota  west virginia  wisconsin  and wyoming 

table of contents regulation of federal student financial aid programs to be eligible to participate in the title iv programs  an institution must comply with specific requirements contained in the higher education act and the regulations issued thereunder by the department of education 
an institution must  among other things  be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state in which it is physically located in our case  arizona and maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting commission recognized by the department of education in our case  the higher learning commission 
the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through the title iv programs  the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs  and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for profit educational institutions have caused congress to require the department of education to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for profit educational institutions 
as a result  our institution is subject to extensive oversight and review 
because the department of education periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations  we cannot predict with certainty how the title iv program requirements will be applied in all circumstances 
significant regulations and other factors relating to the title iv programs that could adversely affect us include the following congressional action 
congress must reauthorize the higher education act on a periodic basis  usually every five to six years  and the most recent reauthorization occurred in august the reauthorized higher education act reauthorized all of the title iv programs in which we participate  but made numerous revisions to the requirements governing the title iv programs  including provisions relating to student loan default rates and the formula for determining the maximum amount of revenue that institutions are permitted to derive from the title iv programs 
in addition  members of congress periodically introduce legislation that would impact title iv programs and our industry generally 
because a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from the title iv programs  any action by congress that significantly reduces title iv program funding or our ability or the ability of our students to participate in the title iv programs could increase our costs of compliance  reduce the ability of some students to finance their education at our institution  require us to seek to arrange for other sources of financial aid for our students and materially decrease our student enrollment 
recent significant congressional activity has included the following in june  the us senate committee on health  education  labor and pensions help committee held the first in a series of hearings to examine the proprietary education sector 
at a subsequent hearing in august  the government accountability office gao presented a report of its review of various aspects of the proprietary sector  including recruitment practices and the degree to which proprietary institutions revenue is composed of title iv funding 
following a two year investigation that included six congressional hearings  three previous reports and broad document requests  on july   the help committee  chaired by sen 
tom harkin  released a report entitled for profit higher education the failure to safeguard the federal investment and ensure student success 
the report advocates significant changes in the requirements governing participation by for profit educational institutions in title iv student financial aid programs  including the following tie access to federal aid to meeting minimum student outcome thresholds  prohibit institutions from funding marketing  advertising and recruiting activities with federal financial aid dollars  improve cohort default rate tracking by expanding the default reporting rate period beyond years  require that proprietary colleges receive at least percent of revenues from sources other than federal funds  and use criteria beyond accreditation and state authorization for determining institutions access to federal financial aid 
on september   sen 
tom carper  the chairman of the senate homeland security and government affairs subcommittee on federal financial management  government information  federal services and international security  held a hearing on improving educational outcomes for our military and veterans  focusing on the quality of education for the military and veterans population and the treatment of such funding for purposes of the rule calculation that  if enacted  would adversely impact our rule percentage 
sen 
carper suggested a follow up roundtable discussion 
other congressional hearings or roundtable discussions are expected to be held regarding various aspects of the education industry that may affect our business 

table of contents accreditation by the higher learning commission is important to us for several reasons  including the fact that it enables our students to receive title iv financial aid 
other colleges and universities depend  in part  on an institution s accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools 
employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating candidates credentials  and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards 
if we fail to satisfy the standards of the higher learning commission  we could lose our accreditation by that agency  which would cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs 
the reauthorization of the higher education act in and final regulations thereunder issued by the department of education that became effective july  require accreditors to monitor the growth of programs at institutions that are experiencing significant enrollment growth 
the higher learning commission requires all affiliated institutions to complete an annual data report 
if the non financial data  particularly enrollment information  and any other information submitted by the institution indicate problems  rapid change  or significant growth  the higher learning commission staff may require that the institution address any concerns arising from the data report in the next self study and visit process 
the higher learning commission staff may also recommend that its institutional actions council require additional monitoring 
in addition  regulations issued by the department of education require the higher learning commission to notify the department of education if an institution it accredits that offers distance learning programs experiences an increase in its headcount enrollment of or more in any fiscal year  and the department of education may consider that information in connection with its own regulatory oversight activities 
in addition to institutional accreditation by the higher learning commission  there are numerous specialized accrediting commissions that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction  many of which are in healthcare and professional fields 
accreditation of specific programs by one of these specialized accrediting commissions signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of those agencies 
in addition to being institutionally accredited by the higher learning commission  we also have the following specialized accreditations the association of collegiate business schools and programs accredits our executive master of business administration degree program  master of business administration degree program and our bachelor of science degree programs in accounting  business administration  marketing  and entrepreneurship  the commission on collegiate nursing education accredits our bachelor of science in nursing and master of science in nursing degree programs  and the commission on accreditation of athletic training education accredits our athletic training program 
if we fail to satisfy the standards of any of these specialized accrediting commissions  we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs  which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and prevent our students from seeking and obtaining appropriate licensure in their fields 
on july   we announced that  among other leadership changes  our board of directors had appointed mr 
brian e 
mueller  our chief executive officer  to the additional position of president of grand canyon university  effective september   replacing dr 
kathy player  who  effective september   had resigned to accept the position of associate provost 
in accordance with the higher learning commission s rules  we promptly notified the higher learning commission of these changes 
in response to a request from the higher learning commission thereafter  we provided the higher learning commission with information related to the grand canyon university academic governance structure  including copies of our corporate documents  the bylaws governing grand canyon university s board of trustees  organizational charts and information about the individuals comprising our board of directors and the board of trustees of grand canyon university 
in november  the higher learning commission notified us that the manner in which the board of trustees of grand canyon university was structured relative to our corporate board of directors may not comply with new higher learning commission policies scheduled to take effect on january  that require a board of trustees to have a certain degree of independence and autonomy in its oversight of the financial and academic affairs of an accredited institution 
in response to this notice  we reviewed the higher learning commission s new accreditation policies as they relate to the independence and autonomy of the board of trustees of grand canyon university  revised and updated the bylaws governing the board of trustees in a manner which we believe complies with the new accreditation policies  implemented these new bylaws effective as of january   and provided a copy of the new bylaws to the higher learning commission 
at this point  we believe we are in compliance with the higher learning commission s policies on institutional control and are not aware of any further issues that the higher learning commission may have 

table of contents on december   rep 
elijah cummings  the ranking member of the house committee on oversight and government reform requested certain information from the publicly traded proprietary schools  including us  related to the compensation of our executives substantially all of which was already publicly available 
on january   sen 
richard durbin of illinois introduced a bill that would change the rule discussed below to an rule and require that colleges count gi bill benefits  military tuition assistance  and several other sources of federal funds as student financial aid the durbin bill 
in april  president obama signed an executive order directing the departments of defense  veteran affairs and education to establish principles of excellence principles  based on certain guidelines set forth in the executive order  to apply to educational institutions receiving federal funding that serve service members  veterans and family members 
the departments of defense  veteran affairs and education continue to implement the principles 
on may   the department of veterans affairs va distributed a letter requesting that institutions confirm in writing their intent to comply or not comply with respect to the principles 
we confirmed in writing that we will comply with the principles 
on july   the department of education issued guidance regarding implementation of certain requirements of the executive order  in the form of a dear colleague letter to institutions that endorse the principles 
these principles could increase the cost of delivering educational services to our military and veteran students 
we will continue to monitor the progress of this activity 
on july   the moving ahead for progress in the st century act was signed into law and included provisions to temporarily freeze the interest rate on subsidized stafford loans at through june  and to change eligibility rules for subsidized student loans 
new borrowers on or after july  will not be eligible for new subsidized student loans if the period during which the borrower has received such loans exceeds of the published length of the borrower s educational program 
in april  congress permanently eliminated year round pell grant awards beginning with the award year as part of the fiscal year continuing resolution spending bill 
we believe this change  which did not reduce the maximum annual grant level  will have only a nominal impact on our business 
however  because the pell grant program is one of the largest non defense discretionary spending programs in the federal budget  it is a target for reduction as congress addresses the budget deficits 
a reduction in the maximum annual pell grant amount or changes in eligibility could result in increased student borrowing  which would make more difficult our ability to comply with other important regulatory requirements  such as the cohort default rate regulations  which are discussed below  and could negatively impact enrollment 
in august  president obama signed into law the budget control act of  which provided for an increase in the federal government borrowing limit and spending reductions in two phases 
the first phase imposed various spending cuts  including the elimination of the partial in school interest subsidy for graduate student loans as of july  the cost of borrowing has increased for graduate students who defer payment of interest while enrolled  which could adversely impact enrollment 
also  effective july   congress eliminated pell grants for students without a high school diploma or ged  but who have demonstrated an ability to benefit from postsecondary education 
in december  congress passed the federal fiscal year budget  which included the nine remaining appropriations bills needed to fund the federal government for the remainder of the federal fiscal year 
the consolidated appropriations act of appropriations act  which president obama signed on december   included award year funding levels for title iv programs and maintained a  maximum federal pell grant for the award year by cutting spending on the other student aid programs and placing new restrictions on eligibility 
additionally  the appropriations act reduced the maximum income that makes an applicant for title iv program funds eligible for an automatic zero expected family contribution from  to  this will reduce the number of students eligible for the maximum federal pell grant 
furthermore  the appropriations act eliminated the automatic pell grant award for students whose calculated award is at least of the maximum pell grant but less than the confluence of the increasing scrutiny by congress of the proprietary education sector and the congressional focus on the us budget deficit increases the likelihood of legislation  whether based on the foregoing ideas or others  that will adversely impact our business 
for example  congress could extend the elimination of the in school interest subsidy to undergraduate students or to undergraduate students in proprietary institutions  reduce the maximum amount of or change the eligibility standards for student loans and or pell grants or make other material changes in title iv programs driven by policy considerations  economic considerations or both 
as proposed in the durbin bill referred to above  congress could also revise the rule  discussed more fully below  in a number of ways  including changing how certain funds are counted under this rule  revising the percentage of income that proprietary schools must derive from non federal sources  or both 
any action by congress that significantly reduces title iv program funding  whether through across the board funding reductions  sequestration or otherwise  or materially impacts the eligibility of our institutions or students to participate in title iv programs would have a material adverse effect on our enrollment  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
congressional action could also require us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our administrative costs and reduce our operating income  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents regulatory changes 
in october and june  the us department of education promulgated new rules related to title iv program integrity issues 
the most significant of these rules for our business are the following modification of the standards relating to the prohibition on payment of incentive compensation to employees involved in student recruitment and enrollment  implementation of standards for state authorization of institutions of higher education  adoption of a definition of gainful employment for purposes of the requirement of title iv student financial aid that a program of study offered by a proprietary institution prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation  and expansion of the definition of misrepresentation  relating to the department s authority to suspend or terminate an institution s participation in title iv programs if the institution engages in substantial misrepresentation about the nature of its educational program  its financial charges  or the employability of its graduates  and expansion of the sanctions that the department may impose for engaging in a substantial misrepresentation 
most of the rules were effective in july in june  however  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia upheld a us district court s ruling vacating the rules requiring state authorization of distance education programs where an institution does not have a physical presence in a state  and also precluded enforcement by the secretary of education of violations of the expanded rules regarding misrepresentation 
the rules regarding the metrics for determining whether an academic program prepares students for gainful employment were also vacated by the us district court for the district of columbia in june  as discussed further below 
in may  the department of education announced its intention to establish negotiated rulemaking committees to prepare proposed regulations under the higher education opportunity act of negotiations to address teacher preparation issues and post disbursement student loan issues  including issues with income based and income contingent loan repayments plans  began in january and concluded in april and were the subject of final regulations published on november  we do not expect these regulations to substantially affect our business 
in may  the department announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations under the higher education opportunity act of designed to prevent fraud and otherwise ensure proper use of title iv program funds  especially within the context of current technologies 
in particular  the department intends that the regulations will address the use of debit cards and other banking mechanisms for disbursing federal student aid  improve and streamline the campus based aid programs  and further help institutions prevent fraudulent student activity 
public hearings were held in may and committee negotiations began in late and are expected to conclude in eligibility and certification procedures 
each institution must apply periodically to the department of education for continued certification to participate in the title iv programs 
such recertification generally is required every six years  but may be required earlier  including when an institution undergoes a change in control 
an institution may also come under the department of education s review when it expands its activities in certain ways  such as opening an additional location  adding a new educational program or modifying the academic credentials it offers 
the department of education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances  such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control 
during the period of provisional certification  the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the school s program participation agreement with the department of education 
in addition  the department of education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location  add an educational program  acquire another school  or make any other significant change 
if the department of education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in the title iv programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action 
students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive title iv program funds 
since july  we had been provisionally certified to participate in the title iv programs on a month to month basis 
on april   following the completion of the department of education s review of information we had provided in connection with a deemed change in control that resulted from the termination in january of voting agreements that were in effect among certain of our stockholders  the department of education notified us that it had approved our application for a change in control and issued to us a new  provisional program participation agreement to participate in the title iv programs 
while this certification is provisional  the department of education s action removed us from month to month status  provided for our continued participation in title iv programs through december   and did not impose any conditions such as any letter of credit requirement or other restrictions on us during the provisional period other than the standard restrictions applicable to a provisional certification 
in accordance with the terms of the provisional certification  we may apply for recertification on a full basis by submitting a complete application by no later than september  if the department of education does not renew or withdraws our certification to participate in the title iv programs at any time  our students would no longer be able to receive title iv program funds 
alternatively  the department of education could renew our certification  but restrict or delay our students receipt of title iv funds  limit the number of students to whom we could disburse such funds  or place other restrictions on us  or it could delay our recertification beyond december   in which case our provisional certification would continue on a month to month basis 
any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments and us 

table of contents administrative capability 
department of education regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in the title iv programs 
to meet the administrative capability standards  an institution must  among other things comply with all applicable title iv program requirements  have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer the title iv programs  have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students  not have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels  have various procedures in place for awarding  disbursing and safeguarding title iv funds and for maintaining required records  administer the title iv programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls  not be  and not have any principal or affiliate who is  debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension  provide financial aid counseling to its students  refer to the department of education s office of inspector general any credible information indicating that any student  parent  employee  third party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving the title iv programs  submit all required reports and consolidated financial statements in a timely manner  and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability 
if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria  the department of education may require the institution to repay title iv funds its students previously received  transfer the institution from the advance method of payment of title iv funds to heightened cash monitoring status or the reimbursement system of payment  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit  suspend or terminate the institution s participation in the title iv programs 
if we are found not to have satisfied the department of education s administrative capability requirements  our students could lose  or be limited in their access to  title iv program funding 
financial responsibility 
the higher education act and department of education regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as grand canyon university must satisfy in order to participate in the title iv programs 
the department of education evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards on an annual basis based on the institution s annual audited consolidated financial statements  as well as when the institution applies to the department of education to have its eligibility to participate in the title iv programs recertified 
the most significant financial responsibility standard is the institution s composite score  which is derived from a formula established by the department of education based on three financial ratios equity ratio  which measures the institution s capital resources  financial viability and ability to borrow  primary reserve ratio  which measures the institution s ability to support current operations from expendable resources  and net income ratio  which measures the institution s ability to operate at a profit or within its means 
the department of education assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative to positive  with negative reflecting financial weakness and positive reflecting financial strength 
the department of education then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution 
the composite score for an institution s most recent fiscal year must be at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further department of education oversight 
our composite scores for our fiscal years ended december   and were  and  respectively  and  therefore  we are considered financially responsible for purposes of these regulations 
we have not yet submitted our consolidated financial statements to the department of education for our fiscal year  but have calculated that our composite score for the fiscal year will be at least this expected increase in our composite score between and is primarily due to the increase in our term loan since our investments in the ground campus infrastructure during  and which caused our composite score decreases between and are not given credit in the composite score computation 
we have modeled our composite score for future years using  among other estimates  our estimated ground campus capital expenditures and believe that our composite score will remain at a financially responsible level for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in addition to having an acceptable composite score  an institution must  among other things  provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with title iv program requirements  meet all of its financial obligations  including required refunds to students and any title iv liabilities and debts  be current in its debt payments  and not receive an adverse  qualified  or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited consolidated financial statements 
if the department of education were to determine that we did not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other factors  we would expect to be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis permitted by the department of education  which could include  in the department of education s discretion  posting a letter of credit  accepting provisional certification  complying with additional department of education monitoring requirements  agreeing to receive title iv program funds under an arrangement other than the department of education s standard advance funding arrangement  such as the reimbursement system of payment or heightened cash monitoring  and complying with or accepting other limitations on our ability to increase the number of programs we offer or the number of students we enroll 
the requirement to post a letter of credit or other sanctions imposed by the department of education could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our cash flows 
if we are unable to meet the minimum composite score or comply with the other standards of financial responsibility  and could not post a required letter of credit or comply with the alternative bases for establishing financial responsibility  our students could lose their access to title iv program funding 
return of title iv funds for students who withdraw 
when a student who has received title iv program funds withdraws from school  the institution must determine the amount of title iv program funds the student has earned and then must return the unearned title iv program funds a return to title iv to the appropriate lender or the department of education in a timely manner  which is generally no later than days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew 
if such payments are not timely made  the institution will be required to submit a letter of credit to the department of education equal to of the title iv funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year 
under department of education regulations  the letter of credit requirement is triggered by late returns of title iv program funds for or more of the withdrawn students and involving more than two student refunds in the audit sample in the institution s annual title iv compliance audit for either of the institution s two most recent fiscal years or in a department of education program review 
we did not exceed this threshold in our annual title iv compliance audits for the most recent year for which we have completed a title iv compliance audit  or prior to spring  we operated in a term based environment for both our traditional and nontraditional students in which  in accordance with department of education regulations  we calculated our returns to title iv based on the number of completed days in a term as a percentage of the total days in the term  with the exception that  with respect to courses offered in a modular setting ie those offered to nontraditional students as two eight week courses  or modules  in a term  if a student completed the first course but withdrew prior to the second course  then the full financial aid award was earned by and paid to the student and no return to title iv calculation was done 
in april  we converted from a term based environment to a non term  borrower based referred to as bbay environment for our non traditional students 
in a bbay environment  we operate on a credit academic year credit payment period for our undergraduate students  who must take three courses during each payment period  and a credit academic year credit payment period for our graduate students  who must take two courses during each payment period  and  as a result  we now calculate returns to title iv based on the percentage of the payment period attended in comparison to the full payment period there is no module concept in a non term  borrower based environment 
in this environment  a student whether undergraduate or graduate must complete greater than of the payment period in order to earn the full financial aid award 
thus  if a student completes the first course but withdraws prior to the second one and therefore does not complete greater than of the payment period  then the full financial aid award is not earned by the student 
in such case  we must perform a return to title iv calculation and most  if not all  of the funds for future courses would be returned to the lender or the department of education 
if the student withdraws after the threshold  then the student is deemed to have earned of the title iv program funds he or she received 

table of contents the rule 
a requirement of the higher education act  commonly referred to as the rule  that is applicable only to for profit  postsecondary educational institutions like us  provides that an institution loses its eligibility to participate in the title iv programs if the institution derives more than of its revenue for each of two consecutive fiscal years from title iv program funds 
for purposes of the rule  revenue is calculated under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of an institution s revenue under generally accepted accounting principles that appears in its consolidated financial statements 
under the rule  an institution becomes ineligible to participate in the title iv programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which it exceeds the threshold  and its period of ineligibility extends for at least two consecutive fiscal years 
if an institution exceeds the threshold for two consecutive fiscal years and it and its students have received title iv funds during the subsequent period of ineligibility  the institution will be required to return those title iv funds to the applicable lender or the department of education 
if an institution s rate exceeds for any single fiscal year  it will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years 
the august reauthorization of the higher education act included significant revisions to the rule that became effective upon the date of the law s enactment  including provisions that allowed institutions  when calculating their compliance with this revenue test  to exclude from their title iv program revenue for a three year period ended june  the additional federal student loan amounts that became available through the unsubsidized stafford loan program starting in july given the level of complexity of this calculation  we did not seek to quantify precisely the benefit that we may have derived in the percentage during the periods in which any temporary exclusions were applicable 
as such  our reported rates below for and exclude the benefits from any such exclusions 
using the department of education s cash basis  regulatory formula under the rule as currently in effect  for our   and fiscal years  we derived approximately   and  respectively  of our rule revenue from title iv program funds 
as a result of the continuing increase in the number of students attending our ground campus  who typically finance a greater percentage of their educational costs with non title iv sources of funds  we expect the percentage of our revenue that we receive from title iv programs to remain stable or to continue to decrease in the future  although this may be impacted by recent changes in federal law that increased title iv grant and loan limits  as well as the ongoing economic environment  which has adversely affected the employment circumstances of our students and their parents and increased their reliance on title iv programs 
if we were to exceed the threshold for two consecutive years such that we lost our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  or if congress passed legislation changing how certain funds are counted under this rule  revising the percentage of income that proprietary schools must derive from non federal sources  or both  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition  and results of operations 
student loan defaults 
under the higher education act  an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the title iv programs if defaults by its students on the repayment of their federal student loans exceed certain levels 
for each federal fiscal year  the department of education calculates a rate of student defaults for each institution known as a cohort default rate 
an institution s cohort default rate for a federal fiscal year historically has been calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who became subject to their repayment obligation in one federal fiscal year default in that same year or by the end of the following federal fiscal year the two year method 
the reauthorization of the higher education act in extended the measurement period for cohort default rates so that the rate is calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who became subject to their repayment obligation in one federal fiscal year default in that same year or by the end of the second following federal fiscal year the three year method  a change which would be expected to increase cohort default rates for most if not all institutions 
the department of education issued a final regulation indicating that it would begin to implement this extended measurement period for the cohort default rates calculated for loans entering repayment in federal fiscal year  which is the year that ended on september  the department of education included a transition period of three years during which it will calculate two cohort default rates for each institution for each of federal fiscal years  and  with one such rate measured under the two year method and the other such rate measured under the three year method 
on september   the department of education released official federal fiscal year two year and federal fiscal year three year federal student loan cohort default rates 
this was the first time the department of education issued an official three year rate  and it was nationally  a slight decrease from the trial three year rate of for the cohort 
the cohort default rates for federal fiscal years  and  as calculated under the new three year method  are not expected to be published until calendar years  and the department of education will apply different legal thresholds to measure an institution s compliance under each set of rates 
if the department of education notifies an institution that its cohort default rates exceed  as calculated under the two year method  for each of its three most recent federal fiscal years  or exceed  as calculated under the three year method  for each of its three most recent federal fiscal years  the institution s participation in the fdl program and the pell grant program will end days after that notification  unless the institution appeals that determination in a timely manner on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
in addition  an institution s participation in the fdl program will end days after notification by the department of education that its most recent cohort default rate  as calculated under either the two year method or the three year method  is greater than  unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
an institution whose participation ends under either of these provisions may not participate in the relevant programs for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the institution receives the notification or for the next two fiscal years 
if an institution s cohort default rate for any single federal fiscal year equals or exceeds under the two year method  or under the three year method  the department of education may place the institution on provisional certification status 

table of contents our cohort default rates  under the two year method  on federal student loans for the   and federal fiscal years  the three most recent years for which such rates have been calculated  were   and  respectively 
our cohort default rate  under the three year method  for the federal fiscal year was  and our trial cohort default rates  under the three year method  for the and federal fiscal years  as issued by the department of education  were and  respectively 
incentive compensation rule 
an institution that participates in the title iv programs may not provide any commission  bonus  or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment  admissions  or financial aid awarding activity 
prior to july   department of education regulations included safe harbors that described payments and arrangements that did not violate the incentive compensation rule 
the new rules effective july  eliminated the safe harbors 
the restrictions of the incentive compensation rule  which extend to any third party companies that an educational institution contracts with for student recruitment  admissions  or financial aid awarding services  increase the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation 
this makes the development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish 
as such  these changes limit our ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities  which could make it more difficult to attract and retain highly qualified employees 
compliance reviews 
we are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies  including the department of education  its office of inspector general  state licensing agencies  the applicable state approving agencies for financial assistance to veterans  and accrediting commissions 
as part of the department of education s ongoing monitoring of institutions administration of the title iv programs  the higher education act also requires institutions to annually submit to the department of education a title iv compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and department of education audit standards 
in addition  to enable the department of education to make a determination of an institution s financial responsibility  each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with department of education regulations 
in connection with its administration of the title iv federal student financial aid programs  the department of education periodically conducts program reviews at selected schools that receive title iv funds 
in july  the department of education initiated a program review of grand canyon university covering the and award years 
as part of this program review  a department of education program review team conducted a site visit on our campus in july and reviewed  and in some cases requested further information regarding  our records  practices and policies relating to  among other things  financial aid  enrollment  enrollment counselor compensation  program eligibility and other title iv compliance matters 
while we never received a formal exit interview  which we had understood to be the typical step prior to the department of education s issuance of a preliminary program review report  on august   we received from the department of education a written preliminary program review report that included five findings  two of which involve individual student specific errors concerning the monitoring of satisfactory academic progress for two students and the certification of one student s federal family educational loan as an unsubsidized stafford loan rather than a subsidized stafford loan 
the other three findings are as follows incentive compensation issue 
during a portion of the period under review  we had in place a compensation plan for our enrollment counselors that was designed to comply with the regulatory safe harbors in effect during such period that allowed companies to make adjustments to fixed compensation for enrollment personnel  provided that any such adjustment i was not made more than twice during any twelve month period  and ii was not based solely on the number of students recruited  admitted  enrolled  or awarded financial aid 
the plan at issue provided for enrollment counselor performance to be reviewed on a number of non enrollment related factors that could account for a substantial portion of any potential base compensation adjustment 
the preliminary program review report does not appear to set forth any definitive finding regarding the plan  but the department of education has requested additional information from us regarding our enrollment counselor compensation practices and policies in effect during the period under review 
we continue to believe that the plan at issue  both as designed and as applied  did not base compensation solely on success in enrolling students in violation of applicable law 
we are continuing our efforts to communicate with the department of education to resolve this matter 
gainful employment issue 
the preliminary program review report sets forth the department of education s position that our bachelor of arts in interdisciplinary studies program was not an eligible program under title iv because it did not provide students with training to prepare them for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
historically  this gainful employment standard has been a requirement for title iv eligibility for programs offered at proprietary institutions of higher education such as grand canyon university although  pursuant to legislation passed in and effective as of july   this requirement no longer applies to designated liberal arts programs offered by us and certain other institutions that have held accreditation by a regional accrediting agency since a date on or before october  we have held a regional accreditation since 
we believe that our interdisciplinary studies program  which we first offered in fall in response to a request by one of our employer partners  was an eligible program under the gainful employment standard in effect prior to july  we are continuing our efforts to communicate with the department of education to resolve this matter 

table of contents inadequate procedures related to non passing grades 
the preliminary program review report sets forth the department of education s position that  during the period under review and prior to the time we converted from a term based financial aid system to a non term  borrower based financial aid system in mid  we failed to have an accurate system in place that would enable us to determine if students with non passing grades for a term had no documented attendance for the term or should have been treated as unofficial withdrawals for the term  thereby potentially requiring us to return all or a portion of the title iv monies previously received with respect to such students 
although we are confident in the legal sufficiency of our policies that were in place during the period under review  we are continuing to make efforts to discuss this finding with the department of education 
as part of the process of reviewing and responding to this finding  the department of education has requested that we conduct a further review of student files and provide additional information to the department of education following the completion of such review 
we have provided responses and further information on each of these issues as requested or required by the department of education and are continuing our efforts to communicate with the department of education to resolve the issues raised in the preliminary program review report 
with respect to the issue regarding inadequate procedures related to non passing grades in particular  we have continued to review student files for the period from july  to june  in accordance with the department of education s request 
although we have not yet completed the file review  we have determined  based on current interpretations provided by the department of education  that certain pell grants that we received for students that later unofficially withdrew should have been returned under applicable return to title iv rules 
although when we make a return to title iv the applicable students are obligated to repay us for the amounts returned  we have decided that that we will not seek reimbursement from applicable students once these pell returns are made 
during the year ended december   we reserved million related to these refunds 
we are unable  at this time  to determine whether additional refunds will be necessary as a result of the preliminary findings 
we cannot presently predict whether or if further information requests will be made  how the foregoing issues will be resolved  when the final program review determination letter will be issued  or when the program review will be closed 
at this time  the department of education has not specified the amount of any potential refunds or penalties that it may seek or assess 
our policies and procedures are planned and implemented to comply with the applicable standards and regulations under title iv and we are committed to resolving any issues of non compliance identified in the final program review determination letter and ensuring that we operate in compliance with all department of education requirements 
if the department of education were to make significant findings of non compliance in the final program review determination letter  then  after exhausting any administrative appeals available to us  we could be required to pay a fine  return title iv monies previously received  or be subjected to other administrative sanctions 
while we cannot currently predict the final outcome of the department of education review  any such final adverse finding could damage our reputation in the industry and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
privacy of student records 
the family educational rights and privacy act of  or ferpa  and the department of education s ferpa regulations  require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students educational records by limiting an institution s disclosure of a student s personally identifiable information without the student s prior written consent 
ferpa also requires institutions to allow students to review and request changes to their educational records maintained by the institution  to notify students at least annually of this inspection right  and to maintain records in each student s file listing requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in that information 
if an institution fails to comply with ferpa  the department of education may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution s receipt of further federal funds 
in addition  educational institutions are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the gramm leach bliley act  or glba  a federal law designed to protect consumers personal financial information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers 
glba and the applicable glba regulations require an institution to  among other things  develop and maintain a comprehensive  written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students  parents  or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship 
if an institution fails to comply with the applicable glba requirements  it may be required to take corrective actions  be subject to monitoring and oversight by the ftc  and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the ftc 
for profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the ftc with respect to their collection  use  and disclosure of student information 
the institution must also comply with the ftc red flags rule  a section of the federal fair credit reporting act  that requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts 
potential effect of regulatory violations 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing the title iv programs  the department of education could impose one or more sanctions  including transferring us to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment  requiring us to repay title iv program funds  requiring us to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education as a condition for continued title iv certification  taking emergency action against us  initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit  suspend  or terminate our participation in the title iv programs  or referring the matter for civil or criminal prosecution 
if such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against us and resulted in a substantial curtailment or termination of our participation in the title iv programs  our enrollments  revenues  and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents if we lost our eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  or if the amount of available title iv program funds was reduced  we would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students 
we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to our students  but there is no assurance that this would be the case 
the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid would likely not be as favorable as those for title iv program funds  and we might be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing such alternative assistance 
it is unlikely that we would be able to arrange alternative funding on any terms to replace all the title iv funding our students receive 
accordingly  our loss of eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  or a reduction in the amount of available title iv program funding for our students  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid 
in addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in the title iv programs  we are also subject to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies  but also by other government agencies and third parties  such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public 
state authorization 
states have the authority to assert jurisdiction  to the extent they so choose  over educational institutions offering online degree programs in a state but that otherwise have no physical location or other presence in that state 
the final program integrity rules adopted by the department of education on october  and effective july  included a provision that requires online providers to meet any such state requirements 
in july  the department of education announced that it will no longer enforce a requirement that distance education programs obtain permission to operate in every state in which they enroll at least one student  following the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit s ruling the previous month that vacated the requirement on procedural grounds 
while the department of education will no longer seek to enforce applicable state law requirements  educational institutions will still need permission to operate in their home states and have to comply with state laws on authorization 
in addition to arizona  we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the state education agency in those states  which we have obtained  while in other states we have determined that we are exempt under applicable state law from licensure or authorization requirements due to our regional accreditation or for other reasons 
in still other states  we have obtained approvals to operate as we have determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities 
although we have a process for evaluating the compliance of our online educational programs with state requirements regarding distance and correspondence learning  and have experienced no significant restrictions on our educational activities to date as a result of such requirements  state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states  are not well developed in many states  are imprecise or unclear in some states and are subject to change 
moreover  it is also unclear whether and to what extent state agencies may augment or change their regulations in this area as a result of these new department of education regulations and increased scrutiny 
if we fail to comply with licensing or authorization requirements for a particular state  or fail to obtain licenses or authorizations when required  we could lose our licensure or authorization from that state or be subject to other sanctions  including restrictions on our activities in that state  and fines and penalties  including department of education sanctions 
the loss of licensure or authorization in a state other than arizona could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering educational services to current students in that state  which could significantly reduce our enrollments 
approval of new programs 
the final program integrity rules adopted october  and effective july  included provisions regarding the approval of new programs 
although the final rules relaxed the program approval standard originally proposed  the rules still impose various requirements on  and could adversely affect  our ability to add new academic programs 
in addition  the department of education has published no definite standards by which schools can determine the likelihood that any program will be approved 
as described below  on june   the us district court for the district of columbia invalidated the requirement that institutions seeking to offer a new program obtain prior approval from the department of education  based on the court s finding that the requirement was tied to the now invalid minimum loan repayment metric for assessing gainful employment 
notwithstanding this ruling  in november  the department of education issued interpretive guidance indicating that any institutions operating under a provisional program participation agreement  such as grand canyon university  must still receive approval from the department of education in advance of offering any new program 
the department of education has not yet announced whether it will appeal the court s decision  seek to revise the gainful employment regulations through another negotiated rulemaking session  or take other steps 
as such  we believe there remains uncertainty regarding new program approval  which could adversely affect our ability to respond to emerging employment trends and add programs that are responsive to those trends  which in turn could decrease our attractiveness to certain students 
in addition  a lack of certainty could increase the risk of future federal false claims act qui tam lawsuits in which private plaintiffs assert that students improperly received title iv aid while attending a program that has not been approved 

table of contents gainful employment rules 
under the higher education act  proprietary schools are eligible to participate in title iv programs in respect of educational programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation  with the limited exception of qualified programs leading to a bachelor s degree in liberal arts 
historically  this concept has not been defined in detail 
on june   the department of education issued its final gainful employment rule  which provided  among other things  for the following disclosures 
proprietary institutions of higher education as well as public and not for profit institutions offering postsecondary non degree programs must provide prospective students with disclosures on the types of employment associated with the program  total cost of the program  completion rate  job placement rate  if applicable  and median loan debt of program completers 
reporting 
institutions must annually submit information to the department of education about students who complete a program leading to gainful employment in a recognized occupation  including the amount of debt incurred under private loans or institutional finance plans  graduation information  and end of year enrollment information 
new program approval 
the final regulations require institutions to notify the department of education at least days before the start of new educational programs leading to gainful employment in recognized occupations 
this notification must include information on the need for the program  a wage analysis  an institutional program review and approval process  and a demonstration of accreditation 
an institution is not required to obtain formal department of education approval if the notification is submitted at least days prior to the first day of class 
however  if the department of education decides during the course of review that an approval is warranted  a notice will be sent to the institution at least days prior to the first day of class with a request for additional information 
as described below  on june   the us district court for the district of columbia invalidated the requirement that institutions seeking to offer a new program obtain prior approval from the department of education  based on the court s finding that the requirement was tied to the now invalid minimum loan repayment metric for assessing gainful employment 
debt to earnings ratio and loan repayment rate 
the metrics used to define gainful employment in the final rule are based on debt to earnings and loan repayment rates  but with changes from the proposed rule issued july under the final rule  a program leads to gainful employment in a recognized occupation if it meets one of the following metrics loan repayment rate at least percent of former students are repaying their loans 
the repayment rate generally is measured using the student s third and fourth year of repayment  with a few exceptions 
if there are or fewer borrowers in a two year period  the repayment rate period will be expanded to include borrowers in the third  fourth  fifth and sixth years 
if there are still fewer than borrowers after that point  the program is considered to have passed the metric 
debt to earnings ratio either a the estimated annual loan repayment of a typical graduate does not exceed percent of his or her discretionary income income above of the poverty level  or b the estimated annual loan payment of a typical graduate does not exceed percent of his or her total earnings 
the ratios generally will be based upon students in their third and fourth years after graduation  with the same exceptions pertaining to small cohort programs described immediately above  for the repayment rate metric 
debt will be calculated based upon the program s median debt  which will include private loans 
annual payments will be calculated based on a year standard repayment plan for certificate and associates degree programs  years for bachelor s and master s programs  and years for graduate and professional programs 
debt incurred for living expenses is excluded from the calculation 
if a program fails both the loan repayment and debt to earnings metrics  then i after one failure  the institution must provide a warning to students disclosing the amount by which the program missed minimal acceptable performance and the program s plans for improvement and establish a three day waiting period before a student can enroll  ii after two failures within three years  the institution must provide a warning to prospective and enrolled students in the failing program stating the plan it intends to take in response  the risks associated with enrolling or continuing in the program  that the student should expect to have difficulty repaying the loans  and if the school chooses to discontinue the program at this stage  the timeline for doing so  and iii after three failures within four years  the program loses eligibility for federal student aid 
institutions cannot then reestablish the program s eligibility for at least three years 

table of contents the final gainful employment rules were to become effective on july  on june   the us district court for the district of columbia found that the department of education failed to adequately justify the minimum student loan repayment rate measure 
because the court determined that the debt to discretionary income ratio and the debt to total earnings ratio are inextricably intertwined with the minimum loan repayment rate measure  it struck down all three metrics 
in addition  the court invalidated two other provisions of the gainful employment regulations one that requires institutions seeking to offer a new program to obtain prior approval from the department of education  and one that requires institutions to provide data to department of education to calculate the two debt measures based on the court s finding that the provisions are tied to the now invalid minimum loan repayment metric 
notwithstanding this ruling  in november  the department of education issued interpretive guidance indicating that any institution operating under a provisional program participation agreement  such as grand canyon university  must still receive approval from the department of education in advance of offering any new program 
with enforcement of much of the regulatory framework of the gainful employment rules now blocked  the department of education has not yet announced whether it will appeal the court s decision  seek to revise the gainful employment regulations through another negotiated rulemaking session  or take other steps 
we will continue to monitor the department of education s next steps with respect to gainful employment regulations for any impact on our business 
the court did not vacate the portion of the rules requiring proprietary postsecondary institutions to provide prospective students with each eligible program s recognized occupations  cost  completion rate  job placement rate  and median loan debt of program completers 
the disclosure requirements and the requirements for reporting information relating to our programs to the department of education and to our students have increased our administrative burdens 
these reporting requirements could impact student enrollment  persistence and retention in ways that we cannot now predict 
for example  if our reported program information compares unfavorably with other reporting educational institutions  it could adversely impact demand for our programs 
if the rules regarding gainful employment metrics are reinstated on appeal or similar rules are repromulgated by the department in a manner that withstands challenge  the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for title iv funding would be at risk due to factors beyond our control  such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates  changes in student borrowing levels  increases in interest rates  changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income  changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans  and other factors 
the exposure to these external factors could reduce our ability to confidently offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is market demand  and therefore would impact our ability to maintain or grow our business 
substantial misrepresentation 
the higher education act prohibits an institution that participates in title iv programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational program  its financial charges  or the employability of its graduates 
the department of education s program integrity regulations effective july  expanded the definition of misrepresentation and expanded the sanctions that the department may impose for engaging in a substantial misrepresentation 
under the new rules  a misrepresentation is any statement made by the institution or a third party that provides educational programs  marketing  advertising  recruiting  or admissions services to the institution that is false  erroneous or has the likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse 
a substantial misrepresentation is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely  or has reasonably relied  to that person s detriment 
considering the breadth of the definition of substantial misrepresentation  it is possible that despite our efforts to prevent such misrepresentations  our employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations 
as a result  we may face complaints from students and prospective students over statements made by us and our agents throughout the enrollment  admissions and financial aid process  as well as throughout attendance at the university  which would expose us to increased risk of enforcement action and applicable sanctions or other penalties and increased risk of private qui tam actions under the federal false claims act 
under the new rules  if the department of education determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation  the department of education may revoke an institution s program participation agreement  impose limitations on the institution s participation in title iv programs  deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters  or initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit  suspend  or terminate its eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
if the department of education determines that statements made by us or on our behalf are in violation of the new regulations  we could be subject to sanctions and other liability  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in june  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated enforcement by the secretary of education of violations of the expanded rules regarding misrepresentation and required the secretary to revise the rule consistent with the court s ruling 
as of yet  the department of education has not issued a revised rule 
regulatory standards that may restrict institutional expansion or other changes many actions that we may wish to take in connection with expanding our operations or other changes are subject to review or approval by the applicable regulatory agencies 
in addition to those matters described in detail below  most state education agencies impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries 
see state educational licensure and authorization 

table of contents adding teaching locations  implementing new educational programs  and increasing enrollment 
the requirements and standards of state education agencies  accrediting commissions  and the department of education limit our ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations  implement new educational programs  or increase enrollment in certain programs 
many states require review and approval before institutions can add new locations or programs  and arizona also limits the number of undergraduate nursing students we may enroll which represents a small portion of our overall nursing program 
the arizona state board for private postsecondary education  the higher learning commission  and other state education agencies and specialized accrediting commissions that authorize or accredit us and our programs generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding new locations or implementing new programs  and upon notification may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial  academic  and other qualifications of the institution 
with respect to the department of education  if an institution participating in the title iv programs plans to add a new location or educational program  the institution must generally apply to the department of education to have the additional location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution s title iv eligibility 
historically  a degree granting institution such as us was not required to obtain the department of education s approval of additional programs that lead to an associate  bachelor s  professional  or graduate degree at the same degree level as programs previously approved by the department of education  and  similarly  an institution was not required to obtain advance approval for new programs that prepare students for gainful employment in the same or a related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated by the department of education as an eligible program at that institution if it meets certain minimum length requirements 
however  as a condition for an institution  such as grand canyon university  to participate in the title iv programs on a provisional basis  the department of education requires prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add or the extent to which an institution can modify existing educational programs 
if an institution  such as grand canyon university  that is required to obtain the department of education s advance approval for the addition of a new program or new location  fails to do so  the institution may be liable for repayment of the title iv program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program or enrolled at that location 
in addition  as part of the final rules adopted by the department of education on october  and effective july   the department of education issued final regulations imposing new requirements with respect to the approval of new programs 
see regulation of federal student financial aid programs approval of new programs 
acquiring other schools 
while we have not acquired any other schools in the past  we may seek to do so in the future 
the department of education and virtually all state education agencies and accrediting commissions require a company to seek their approval if it wishes to acquire another school 
in our case  we would need to obtain the approval of the arizona state board for private postsecondary education or other state education agency that licenses the school being acquired  the higher learning commission  any other accrediting commission that accredits the school being acquired  and the department of education 
the level of review varies by individual state and accrediting commission  with some requiring approval of such an acquisition before it occurs and others only considering approval after the acquisition has occurred 
the higher learning commission would require us to obtain its advance approval of such an acquisition 
the approval of the applicable state education agencies and accrediting commissions is a necessary prerequisite to the department of education certifying the acquired school to participate in the title iv programs under our ownership 
the restrictions imposed by any of the applicable regulatory agencies could delay or prevent our acquisition of other schools in some circumstances 
provisional certification 
each institution must apply to the department of education for continued certification to participate in the title iv programs at least every six years  or when it undergoes a change in control  and an institution may come under the department of education s review when it expands its activities in certain ways  such as opening an additional location  adding an educational program  or modifying the academic credentials that it offers 
the department of education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards 
in addition  if a company acquires a school from another entity  or if a school undertakes another transaction that constitutes a change in control under department of education regulations  the school will automatically be placed on provisional certification when the department of education approves the transaction 
during the period of provisional certification  the institution must comply with any additional conditions or restrictions included in its program participation agreement with the department of education 
if the department of education finds that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in the title iv programs without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that action 
in addition  the department of education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location  add an educational program  acquire another school  or make any other significant change 
students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive title iv program funds 
since july  we had been provisionally certified to participate in the title iv programs on a month to month basis 
on april   following the completion of the department of education s review of information we had provided in connection with a deemed change in control that resulted from the termination in january of voting agreements that were in effect among certain of our stockholders  the department of education notified us that it had approved our application for a change in control and issued to us a new  provisional program participation agreement to participate in the title iv programs 
while this certification is provisional  the department of education s action removed us from month to month status  provided for our continued participation in title iv programs through december   and did not impose any conditions such as any letter of credit requirement or other restrictions on us during the provisional period other than the standard restrictions applicable to a provisional certification 
in accordance with the terms of the provisional certification  we may apply for recertification on a full basis by submitting a complete application by no later than september  there can be no assurance that the department of education will recertify us at that time or that it will not impose restrictions as a condition of approving our application with respect to any future recertification 

table of contents change in ownership resulting in a change in control 
the department of education  as well as many accrediting commissions and states  require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or control 
with respect to publicly traded corporations  like us  department of education regulations provide that a change in control occurs if  among other things  the corporation has a stockholder that owns  or has voting control over  at least of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation defined in the regulations as a controlling shareholder  and that controlling shareholder ceases to own  or have voting control over  at least of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder 
under department of education regulations  an institution that undergoes a change in control as defined by the department of education loses its eligibility to participate in the title iv programs and must apply to the department of education in order to reestablish such eligibility 
the higher learning commission provides that an institution must obtain its approval in advance of a change in ownership  corporate control or structure in order for the institution to retain its accredited status 
in june  the higher learning commission adopted new policies and standards for the review of transactions that may constitute such a change in control 
one standard provides that a transaction may be considered a change in control if an individual  entity or group increases or decreases its control of shares to greater than or less than of the total outstanding shares of the stock of a parent corporation that owns or controls the accredited institution 
in addition  in the event of a change in control  the higher learning commission requires the institution to obtain its approval in advance of the change  and in certain circumstances that process may require several weeks or several months or more to complete 
in addition  following a change in control  the higher learning commission will conduct an onsite evaluation within six months in order to continue the institution s accreditation 
many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change in control requiring approval  but their thresholds for determining a change in control vary widely 
the standards of the arizona state board for private postsecondary education provide that an institution that is owned by a publicly traded company whose control is vested in the voting members of the board of directors  such as grand canyon education  undergoes a change in control if or more of the voting members of the board of directors change within a month period or the chief executive officer of the corporation changes 
a change in control under the definition of one of the other state agencies that regulate us might require us to obtain approval of a change in control in order to maintain our authorization to operate in that state  and in some cases such states could require us to obtain advance approval of the change in control 
if we were to undergo a change in control under the standards of the arizona state board of private postsecondary education at any time in the future  we would be required to file an application with the arizona state board for private postsecondary education in order to obtain approval for such change in control 
we cannot predict whether the arizona state board for private postsecondary education would impose any limitations or conditions on us  or identify any compliance issues related to us in the context of the change in control process  that could result in our loss of authorization in arizona 
any such loss would result in our loss of eligibility to participate in the title iv programs which would cause a significant decline in our student enrollment
