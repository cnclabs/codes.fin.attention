description of the business we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending 
we also have a leading international presence and rank as the second largest pizza company in the world  based on number of units 
we operate through a network of company owned stores  all of which are in the united states  and  franchise stores located in all states and in more than international markets 
in addition  we operate regional manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 
our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and company owned stores 
changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts 
we monitor both of these metrics very closely  as they directly impact our revenues and profits  and strive to consistently increase both same store sales and our store counts 
retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees as well as company owned store and supply chain revenues 
retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino s pizza brand  the results of our marketing promotions  our ability to execute our store operating model  the overall global economic environment and the success of our business strategies 
we devote significant attention to our brand building efforts  which is evident in our system s estimated billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age 
we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery and carry out offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino s pizza brand 
we also pay particular attention to the store economics  or the investment performance of a store to its owner  of both our franchise and company owned stores 
we believe that our system s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino s pizza store 
we believe these favorable investment requirements  coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending  as well as high quality and focused menu offerings  drive strong store economics  which  in turn  drive demand for new stores 
business performance during  the company continued to produce steady  consistent results with strong earnings per share growth and cash flows 
the company produced positive order count growth  sales growth and store growth domestically  while also producing sales growth and record store growth internationally 
in  we celebrated the opening of our  th store  which is a significant milestone for our global brand 
the results in demonstrated that we continue to deliver the products  service and value that are resonating with our global consumers 
we have continued to improve store level profitability for our domestic franchise and company owned stores in further  over the past several years  our focus domestically has been improving our company through several initiatives  including investments to improve upon our menu  marketing  technology  operations and franchise base 
our menu improvements in included launching our parmesan bread bites and our new handmade pan pizza 
technology remains a focus for us as digital orders continue to grow 
in  we launched a new mobile application for the iphone and ipod touch  and in  we launched a new mobile application for the android smartphone and for amazon s kindle fire 
we believe our new product platforms combined with an innovative  transparent and effective advertising campaign  continued focus on operational excellence and new technology  generated strong sales and earnings growth for the company in  and 
table of contents our international division continued to post strong same store sales growth in and had a record net store openings  including net stores in india  net stores in turkey and net stores in the united kingdom 
continued strong same store sales growth combined with continued store count growth  demonstrate the consistency and reliability of this growing business segment 
these strong results from both our domestic and international stores produced earnings per share growth and increased cash flows in we believe that our franchise business model provides a solid structure on which to build consistent retail sales and store growth that results in strong cash flows that we can deploy to drive shareholder value 
worldwide store counts have increased from  at the beginning of to  at the end of this growth in store counts can be attributed to the global growth of our brand and our pizza delivery and carry out concepts as well as the economics inherent in our system  which attract new franchisees and encourage existing franchisees to grow their businesses 
domestic same store sales increased in  in and in the significant increase in domestic same store sales in was attributable to our innovative and effective advertising campaign for our improved pizza recipe  continued focus on operational excellence and efforts to strengthen our franchisee base over the course of several years 
the increase in domestic same store sales during both and demonstrates that our products and promotions continue to resonate with consumers 
the company experienced traffic increases in our domestic stores in  and international same store sales increased in  in and in internationally  same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of pizza and delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the domino s pizza concept 
in  global retail sales  which are total retail sales at company owned and franchise stores worldwide  increased as compared to retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues 
this increase was driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth as well as an increase in our worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters  offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
domestic same store sales growth reflected the sustained positive sales trends and the continued success of our new products and promotions 
international same store sales growth reflected continued strong performance in the markets where we compete 
in  global retail sales increased as compared to  driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth  growth in worldwide store counts  and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales 
our revenues increased million or in and increased million or in the increase in revenues in was driven primarily by higher international revenues attributable to same store sales and store count growth  higher supply chain revenues due primarily to a change in the mix of products sold  offset in part by slightly lower volumes and higher domestic franchise revenues due to an increase in same store sales 
these increases were offset  in part by lower company owned store revenues  resulting from the sale of company owned stores to multiple franchisees during fiscal and six company owned stores in the first quarter of  as well as the negative impact on international revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in revenues in was driven by higher domestic supply chain revenues resulting from higher cheese and other commodity prices and higher international revenues attributable to same store sales  store count growth and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
additionally  domestic franchise revenues were higher due to an increase in domestic same store sales and fees paid by franchisees related to the in sourcing of certain services  such as online ordering and a call center 
we also incurred an increase in general and administrative expenses for these services paid by franchisees 
these increases were offset in part by lower company owned store revenues resulting from the sale of company owned stores to multiple franchisees during income from operations increased million or in and increased million or in the increase in was driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from both domestic and international franchise stores  higher domestic company owned store margins and higher domestic supply chain margins as described in more detail below 
these increases were offset  in part  by the negative impact of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher general and administrative expenses 
the increase in was driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from both domestic and international franchise stores and to a lesser extent  the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
additionally  income from operations in benefited from higher domestic company owned store margins 

table of contents net income increased million or in and increased million or in the increase in was due primarily to domestic and international same store sales growth  global store growth  higher domestic company owned store margins and higher domestic supply chain margins and was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher general and administrative expenses 
additionally  fiscal was negatively impacted by approximately million of net pre tax expenses incurred in connection with the company s recapitalization 
the increase in net income in was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in income from operations and lower interest expense 
the increase was offset in part by gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt in we operate with significant levels of debt 
as of december   consolidated debt was billion 
historically  a large portion of our cash flows from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases 
our securitized debt requires principal and interest payments until the expected repayment date of january the scheduled principal payments are million in each of and  million in  million in  million in each of and  and million in during fiscal  the company made principal payments of approximately million 
overall  we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant excess cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for uncollectible receivables  long lived and intangible assets  insurance and legal matters  share based payments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition 
we earn revenues through our network of domestic company owned and franchise stores  dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations 
retail sales from company owned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers 
retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company on a weekly basis based on a percentage of retail sales  as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally of domestic franchise retail sales 
in the event that retail sales are not reported timely by a franchisee  the company will record royalty revenues in the period earned based on an estimate of the franchisee s sales  however  these estimates are not significant and have historically been materially consistent with the actual amounts 
revenues from company owned stores and royalty revenues from franchise stores fluctuate from time to time as a result of store count changes 
for example  if a company owned store that generated  in revenue in fiscal is sold to a franchisee in fiscal  revenues from company owned stores would have declined by  in fiscal  while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only  in fiscal  as we generally collect of a domestic franchisee s retail sales 
sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees  while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 
allowances for uncollectible receivables 
we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews 
these estimates are based on  among other factors  historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category 
additionally  we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while write offs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that future write offs will not exceed historical rates 
specifically  if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents at december   our total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables was approximately million  compared to million at january   representing approximately of our consolidated gross accounts receivable at both those respective year ends 
a change in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables at december  would result in a change in reserves of approximately million and a change in income before provision for income taxes by the same amount 
currently  management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that were used to calculate our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables 
long lived and intangible assets 
we record long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and capitalized software  at cost 
for acquisitions of franchise operations  we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets  historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition 
we depreciate and amortize long lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us 
we evaluate the potential impairment of long lived assets at least annually based on various analyses  including the projection of undiscounted cash flows and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
for company owned stores  we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis  which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset or the estimated fair value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of company owned stores during the years presented 
same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets 
if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs  the carrying value of our company owned stores  by market  may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 
at december   we determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment  specifically  our company owned stores 
we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit  which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows  to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  goodwill would be impaired 
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented 
at december   the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value  including the related goodwill 
if cash flows generated by our company owned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 
however  based on the latest impairment analysis  we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 
insurance and legal matters 
we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters 
these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves  legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict 
accordingly  if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason  we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods 
we had accruals for legal matters of approximately million at january  and approximately million at december  for certain periods prior to december and for periods after december  we maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation  general liability and owned and non owned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between  and million  depending on the policy year and line of coverage 
the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates  which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events 
specifically  various methods  including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods  are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating these liabilities  several factors are considered  including the severity  duration and frequency of claims  legal cost associated with claims  healthcare trends and projected inflation 
over the past several years  we have experienced improvements in frequency of claims  however increasing severity of claims and medical costs has partially offset these trends 

table of contents our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented 
management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks 
while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves  changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions  as well as changes in actual experience  could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods 
a change in our self insurance liability at december  would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately million for fiscal we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately million at january  and million at december  share based payments 
we recognize compensation expense related to our share based compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performance based restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions  including the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate  the expected dividend yield and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life  which significantly impact the assumed fair value 
we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
we use historical data to determine these assumptions 
additionally  our stock option  restricted stock and performance based restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the ten year stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements 
management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable  but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 
judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related reserves  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets  if necessary 
during fiscal and in connection with the sale of its six remaining company owned stores in a certain market to a franchisee  the company recorded a deferred tax asset related to the capital loss that resulted from the write off of the tax basis goodwill associated with the market that was sold 
management believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized and provided a valuation allowance of approximately million 
the valuation allowance was recorded as an increase to the provision for income taxes and increased the company s effective tax rate in on an ongoing basis  management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the company had no additional valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets as of december  our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events 
our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions  based on our estimates and assumptions 
changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 
the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet  including tax reserves  also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions 
we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions  however  tax audits  changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes 
we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time  for example the completion of a tax audit  or the expiration of a statute of limitations  or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions 
management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters 
however  to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts  we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of million and including total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million 
historically  we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities 
we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale  and we generally experience to inventory turns per year 
in addition  our sales are not typically seasonal  which further limits our working capital requirements 
these factors  coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations  invest in our business and repurchase our fixed rate notes and our common stock  reduce our working capital amounts 
as of december   we had approximately million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments  million of restricted cash held in a three month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and million of other restricted cash  for a total of million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 
on march   we announced that we had completed the recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries replaced the outstanding fixed rate notes and variable funding notes the notes with new notes the notes issued pursuant to an asset backed securitization 
the notes consist of billion of series fixed rate senior secured notes  class a the fixed rate notes and million of series variable funding senior secured notes  class a the variable funding notes

if we meet certain conditions  including a maximum leverage ratio of x total debt to ebitda  we may elect to not make the scheduled principal payments 
if the leverage ratio subsequently exceeds x  we must make up the payments we had elected not to make 
the notes are subject to certain financial and non financial covenants  including a debt service coverage calculation  as defined in the related agreements 
the notes also include a financial covenant based on the achievement of a minimum amount of global retail sales 
in the event that certain covenants are not met  the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the recapitalization to repay approximately billion in outstanding principal under the notes

as of december   total cash paid for common stock dividends and related anti dilution equivalent payments was approximately million and the total estimated liability recorded for future cash payments on certain performance based restricted stock was approximately million 
during fiscal and in connection with the recapitalization  we incurred approximately million of net expenses 
additionally  in connection with the recapitalization  we recorded an additional million of deferred financing costs as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet during fiscal this amount  in addition to the million recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at january  is expected to be amortized into interest expense over the seven year expected term of the debt 
as of december   we had approximately billion of total debt  of which million was classified as a current liability 
additionally  as of december   we had million of outstanding letters of credit and million of available borrowing capacity under our million variable funding notes 
the letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases 
borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes 
the company has a board of directors approved open market share repurchase program of the company s common stock  which was reset during the third quarter of at million 
the open market share repurchase program has historically been funded by excess cash flows and borrowings available under the variable funding notes 
the company used cash of approximately million and million in and  respectively  for share repurchases under this program 
the company has approximately million left under the million authorization as of december  we expect to continue to use ongoing excess cash flow generation and subject to certain restrictions in the documents governing the variable funding notes availability under the variable funding notes to  among other things  repurchase shares under the current authorized program 
during fiscal  we experienced increases in both domestic and international same store sales versus fiscal additionally  our international business continued to grow stores at a record pace in fiscal and our international store count surpassed the number of stores domestically 
these factors have contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows 
we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  ongoing cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the variable funding notes to  among other things  fund working capital requirements  invest in our core business  and repurchase our common stock 
we have historically funded our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt repayments and repurchases of common stock primarily from our cash flows from operations and  when necessary  our available borrowings under variable funding note facilities 
management believes its current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance and its expected ongoing cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future 
we generally expect annual capital expenditures of approximately million to million 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in existing company owned stores and supply chain centers as well as investments in our proprietary internally developed point of sale system domino s pulse  our digital ordering platform and other technology initiatives  all of which we believe are necessary to sustain and grow our business 
we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  
table of contents cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the million increase in versus was due primarily to a million increase in net income excluding non cash adjustments and an million net change in operating assets and liabilities  due primarily to the timing of payments on current operating liabilities and the timing of prepaid expenses 
the million increase in versus was due primarily to a million net change in operating assets and liabilities  due primarily to the timing of payments on current operating liabilities and an million increase in net income excluding non cash adjustments 
we are focused on continually improving our net income and cash flow from operations 
as noted above  we generated million of cash from our operating activities 
even after deducting our million of capital expenditures  we generated a substantial amount of excess cash in  some of which was deployed on other activities  including the special dividend paid from the recapitalization  repurchases of our common stock or similar uses of cash 
management expects to continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 
cash provided by investing activities was million in cash used in investing activities was million in and million in the million net change in versus was due primarily to a million decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents due to the company eliminating cash pledged as collateral on its letters of credit 
in connection with the recapitalization  these letters of credit now reduce the amount of borrowing available under the company s variable funding notes 
this was offset in part by a million increase in capital expenditures during as a result of increased investments in existing company owned stores and supply chain centers as well as investments in our technology initiatives  all of which we believe are necessary to sustain and grow our business 
the million increase in versus was due primarily to a million change in restricted cash and cash equivalents  offset in part by a million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets  resulting from the sale of certain company owned operations in  and a million decrease in capital expenditures 
cash used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in the million increase in versus was due primarily to billion of repayments of the debt facilities  million dividend and equivalent payments  a million increase in cash paid for financing costs  all of which resulted from our recapitalization  and a million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
these uses of cash for financing activities were offset  in part by billion of proceeds from issuance of the fixed rate notes and a million decrease in purchases of common stock 
the million increase in versus was due primarily to a million increase in purchases of common stock  million cash paid for financing costs in and a million increase in tax payments for restricted stock 
these increases were offset in part by a million decrease in repayments of long term debt and capital lease obligations  a million increase in the proceeds from exercise of stock options and a million increase in the tax impact of our equity based compensation 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that the cash generated from operations  our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under the variable funding notes will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item a 
risk factors 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness  or to make anticipated capital expenditures 
our future operating performance and our ability to service  extend or refinance the fixed rate notes and to service  extend or refinance the variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate 
inflation did not have a material impact on our operations in  or severe increases in inflation  however  could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
in connection with the recapitalization in  we issued fixed rate notes and  at december   we are only exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes 
as of december   we had no borrowings under of variable funding note facility and million available for borrowing  which is net of letters of credit of million 
our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices 
during the normal course of business  we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and  as a result  we are subject to volatility in our food costs 
we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk 
we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
in instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers  these agreements cover our physical commodity needs  are not net settled and are accounted for as normal purchases 
interest rate derivatives from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of managing volatility relating to our borrowing costs 
we had no outstanding derivative instruments as of january  or december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
total revenues of approximately in  in and in were derived from sales to customers and royalties from franchisees outside the contiguous united states 
this business is conducted in the local currency but royalty payments are generally remitted to us in us dollars 
we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk 
a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency rates in each of our top ten international markets  based on store count  would have resulted in a negative impact on revenues of approximately million in
