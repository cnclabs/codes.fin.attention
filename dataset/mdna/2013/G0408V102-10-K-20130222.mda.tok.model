risk solutions years ended december revenue operating income operating margin the demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases  affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage business 
the economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units  and is closely correlated with employment levels  corporate revenue and asset values 
during we began to see improvement in pricing on average globally  however  we would still consider this to be a soft market  which began in in a soft market  premium rates flatten or decrease  along with commission revenues  due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased underwriting capacity 
changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry  as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums paid by insureds 
in  pricing showed signs of stabilization and improvement in both our retail and reinsurance brokerage product lines and we expect this trend to slowly continue into additionally  beginning in late and continuing through  we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy  the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
to prepare these financial statements  we made estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities  what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
in accordance with our policies  we regularly evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including  but not limited to  those concerning revenue recognition  restructuring  pensions  goodwill and other intangible assets  contingencies  share based payments  and income taxes  and base our estimates  assumptions  and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances 
the results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
if our assumptions or conditions change  the actual results we report may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition risk solutions segment revenues include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients 
revenues are recognized when they are earned and realized or realizable 
the company generally considers revenues to be earned and realized or realizable when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client  there is a fixed or determinable price  services have been rendered  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for brokerage commissions  revenue is typically considered to be earned and realized or realizable at the completion of the placement process  assuming all other criteria required to recognize revenue have been met 
the placement process is typically considered complete on the effective date of the related policy 
commission revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations  which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data 
commissions on premiums billed directly by insurance carriers are recognized as revenue when the company has sufficient information to conclude the amount due is determinable  which may not occur until cash is received from the insurance carrier 
investment income is typically recognized as funds for clients are physically held by the company are bearing interest that is deemed probable of collection 
hr solutions segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice and outsourcing contracts 
fees paid by clients for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly  project or fixed fee basis 
revenues from time and materials or cost plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed  assuming all other criteria for recognizing revenue have been met 
revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized as services are provided using a proportional performance model or at the completion of a project based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses are recorded as a component of revenues 
the company outsourcing contracts typically have three to five year terms for benefits services and five to ten year terms for human resources business process outsourcing hr bpo services 
the company recognizes revenues as services are performed  assuming all other criteria for recognizing revenue have been met 
the company may also receive implementation fees from clients either up front or over the ongoing services period as a component of the fee per participant 
lump sum implementation fees received from a client are typically deferred and recognized ratably over the ongoing contract services period 
if a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract  a loss on the contract may be recorded  if necessary  and any remaining deferred implementation revenues would typically be recognized over the remaining service period through the termination date 
in connection with the company long term outsourcing service agreements  highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on the company systems and operating processes 
for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized 
deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis  to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue 
restructuring workforce reduction costs the method used to recognize workforce reduction costs depends on whether the benefits are provided under a one time benefit arrangement or under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
we account for relevant expenses as an ongoing benefit arrangement when we have an established termination benefit policy  statutory requirements dictate the termination benefit amounts  or we have an established pattern of providing similar termination benefits 
the method to estimate the amount of termination benefits is based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated 
we recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from an ongoing benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification or functions and locations of the employees being terminated and notify the employees 
we recognize the workforce reduction costs related to restructuring activities resulting from a one time benefit arrangement when we identify the specific classification or functions and locations of the employees being terminated  notify the employees  and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period 
when employees receive incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period  we recognize the cost of their termination benefits over the remaining service period 
lease termination costs where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it  we recognize a loss and corresponding liability 
the liability reflects our best estimate of the fair value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement 
to determine the loss and corresponding liability  we estimate sublease income based on all information that is reasonably available  which typically includes current market quotes for similar properties 
useful lives on leasehold improvements or other assets associated with lease abandonments may be revised to reflect a shorter useful life than originally estimated  which results in accelerated depreciation 
fair value concepts of severance arrangements and lease losses accounting guidance requires that the liabilities recorded related to our restructuring activities be measured at fair value 
where material  we discount the lease loss calculations to arrive at their present value 
most workforce reductions happen over a short span of time and therefore no discounting is necessary 
however  we may discount the termination benefit arrangement when we terminate employees who will provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended period 
the discount reflects our incremental borrowing rate  which matches the lifetime of the liability 
significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts recorded 
other associated costs with restructuring activities we recognize other costs associated with restructuring activities as they are incurred  including moving costs and consulting and legal fees 
pensions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world 
our most significant plans are located in the us  the us  the netherlands and canada 
our us  us and canadian pension plans are closed to new entrants 
we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our us  us and canadian plans 
recognition of gains and losses and prior service we defer the recognition of gains and losses that arise from events such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions  actual demographic experience and plan asset performance 
unrecognized gains and losses are amortized as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees for our plans in the netherlands and canada  or the average life expectancy of the us and us plan members 
after the effective date of the plan amendments to cease crediting future benefits relating to service  unrecognized gains and losses are also be based on the average life expectancy of members in the canadian plans 
we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses 
as of december   our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements 
we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor  which is defined as of the greater of market related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation 
to the extent not offset by future gains  incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized 
the following table discloses our combined experience loss  the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss  and the estimated amortization of loss by country amounts in millions us uk and non us combined experience loss amortization period in years estimated amortization of loss the unrecognized prior service cost at december  was million in the uk and uk plans 
for the us pension plans we use a market related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets  which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
this approach recognizes of any gains or losses in the current year value of market related assets  with the remaining spread over the next four years 
as this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets and therefore  our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
as of december   the market related value of assets was billion 
we do not use the market related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the us plans recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position which is based on the fair value of the plan assets 
as of december   the fair value of plan assets was billion 
our non us plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets 
rate of return on plan assets and asset allocation the following table summarizes the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense and the related target asset mix us uk and non us expected return in total expected return on equities expected return on fixed income asset mix target equity target fixed income includes investments in infrastructure  real estate  limited partnerships and hedge funds 
in determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets  we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans 
in particular  we surveyed multiple third party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long term expected returns on each asset class  considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods  and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans 
the us pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines 
the actual asset allocation at december  was equity and fixed income securities for the qualified plan 
the investment policy for each uk and uk pension plans is generally determined by the plans trustees 
because there are several pension plans maintained in the uk and uk category  our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan 
further  target allocations are subject to change 
as of december   the uk and uk plans were invested between and in equity and between and in fixed income securities 
impact of changing economic assumptions changes in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 
holding all other assumptions constant  the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our net underfunded status at december  in millions change in discount rate estimated liability discount rate increase decrease in net underfunded status of december  increase decrease us plans uk and uk plans increases to the net underfunded status reflect increases to the company pension obligations  while decreases in the net underfunded status are recoveries toward fully funded status 
holding all other assumptions constant  the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated liability discount rate would have on our estimated pension expense in millions change in discount rate increase decrease in expense increase decrease us plans uk and uk plans holding other assumptions constant  the following table reflects what a one hundred basis point increase and decrease in our estimated long term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated pension expense in millions change in long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease in expense increase decrease us plans uk and uk plans estimated future contributions we estimate contributions of approximately million in as compared with million in goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired 
we classify our intangible assets acquired as either trademarks  customer relationships  technology  non compete agreements  or other purchased intangibles 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued final guidance that gives an entity the option to perform a qualitative assessment that may eliminate the requirement to perform the annual two step test 
we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter  we also test the acquired tradenames which also are not amortized for impairment 
we test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable 
these indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  among others 
no events occurred during that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported goodwill or tradenames 
we perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
an operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar  if none of its components is a reporting unit  or if the segment comprises only a single component 
the goodwill impairment test is initially a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  including goodwill  of the corresponding reporting unit 
if the more likely than not threshold is not met  then the goodwill impairment test becomes a two step analysis 
step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit  goodwill and trademarks are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  we perform step two 
step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted cash flow dcf model based on our most current forecasts 
we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation 
preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the dcf model involve significant judgments  and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
we also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our dcf model results 
the combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our dcf model often results in a premium over our market capitalization  commonly referred to as a control premium 
we believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry 
based on tests performed in both and  there was no indication of goodwill impairment  and no further testing was required 
we review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
there were no indications that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of december  if we are required to record impairment charges in the future  they could materially impact our results of operations 
contingencies we define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one ore more future events occur or fail to occur 
under us gaap  we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when it is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact 
we are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses 
we determine the amount of reserves required  if any  for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item 
the required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue 
we do not recognize gain contingencies until the contingency is resolved 
share based payments share based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
share option accounting we generally use a lattice binomial option pricing model to value share options granted 
lattice based option valuation models use a range of assumptions over the expected term of the options  and estimate expected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of our share price and the implied volatility of traded options on our shares 
in terms of the assumptions used in the lattice based model  we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model 
we stratify employees between those receiving leadership performance plan lpp options  special share plan options  and all other option grants 
we believe that this stratification better represents prospective stock option exercise patterns  base the expected dividend yield assumption on our current dividend rate  and base the risk free rate for the contractual life of the option on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the expected life of employee share options represents the weighted average period share options are expected to remain outstanding  which is a derived output of the lattice binomial model 
restricted share units restricted share units rsus are service based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight line basis over the service period 
we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant 
performance share awards performance share awards psas are performance based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives 
such objectives may be made on a personal  group or company level 
we estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period 
psas may immediately vest at the end of the performance period or may have an additional service period 
compensation cost is recognized over the performance or additional service period  whichever is longer 
the number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved 
we make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates  such as long term plans 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized 
the largest performance based share based payment award plan is the lpp  which has a three year performance period 
the to performance period ended on december   the to performance period ended on december   and the to performance period ended on december  the lpp currently has two open performance periods to and to a upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both lpp plans would have increased our expense by approximately million  while a downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately million 
as the percent of expected performance increases or decreases  the potential change in expense can go from to of the targeted total expense 
income taxes we earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries 
the estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item recognized  or expected to be recognized  in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete item  such as the resolution of prior year tax matters 
the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies  and are based on management assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income  and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles 
deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if  based on the consideration of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in this assessment  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
we assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a more likely than not determination 
we have not recognized a us deferred tax liability for permanently reinvested earnings of certain non us subsidiaries 
additional us income taxes could be recorded or incurred if we change our investment strategy relating to these subsidiaries  which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 
we base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on management interpretation of applicable tax laws  and incorporate management assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions 
using different estimates  assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes  especially those that deploy tax planning strategies  may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations 
we operate in many jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed 
in such jurisdictions  we obtain professional guidance  when available  and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations 
tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions  and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations 
in addition  several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities  including the following the portion of our overall operations conducted in non us tax jurisdictions has been increasing  and we anticipate this trend will continue  to deploy tax planning strategies and conduct global operations efficiently  our subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates  which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and are frequently reviewed by tax authorities  tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties change frequently  requiring us to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes  and the move of the corporate headquarters to london 
new accounting pronouncements note summary of significant accounting principles and practices of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results  if determinable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings  cash flows  and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to manage the risk from these exposures  we enter into a variety of derivative instruments 
we do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks 
see note summary of significant accounting principles and practices of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives 
we are subject to foreign exchange rate risk 
our primary exposures include exchange rates between the u 
s dollar and the euro  british pound  the canadian dollar and the australian dollar 
we use over the counter otc options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements 
additionally  some of our non us brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies 
our uk subsidiary earned approximately of its revenue in us dollars and of its revenue in euros  but most of its expenses are incurred in pounds sterling 
our policy is to convert into pounds sterling sufficient us dollar and euro revenue to fund the subsidiary pound sterling expenses using otc options and forward exchange contracts 
at december   we have hedged of our uk subsidiaries expected uk dollar transaction exposure for the years ending december  and  respectively 
in addition  we have hedged of our uk subsidiaries expected euro transaction exposures for the same time periods 
we do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years 
we also use forward contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures  such as inter company notes and short term assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non functional currency and are subject to remeasurement 
the potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in year end exchange rates would be million and million at december  and respectively 
our fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic short term interest rates 
we monitor our net exposure to short term interest rates and as appropriate  hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments 
this activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the us and on the continent of europe 
a hypothetical  instantaneous parallel decrease in the year end yield curve of basis points would cause a decrease  net of derivative positions  of million and million to and pretax income  respectively 
a corresponding increase in the year end yield curve of basis points would cause an increase  net of derivative positions  of million and million to and pretax income  respectively 
we have long term debt outstanding with a fair market value of billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
this fair value was greater than the carrying value by million at december   and million greater than the carrying value at december  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by approximately at both december  and we have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes  we are not predicting market events
