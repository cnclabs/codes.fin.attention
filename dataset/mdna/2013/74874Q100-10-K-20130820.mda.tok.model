management overview quinstreet is a leader in performance marketing online 
we have built a strong set of capabilities to engage internet visitors with targeted media and to connect our marketing clients with their potential customers online 
we focus on serving clients in large  information intensive industry verticals where relevant  targeted media and offerings help visitors make informed choices  find the products that match their needs  and thus become qualified customer prospects for our clients 
we deliver cost effective marketing results to our clients most typically in the form of a qualified lead or inquiry  in the form of a qualified click  or call 
leads  clicks or calls can then convert into a customer or sale for clients at a rate that results in an acceptable marketing cost to them 
we are typically paid by clients when we deliver qualified leads  clicks  calls or customers as defined by our agreements with them 
because we bear the costs of media  our programs must deliver value to our clients and provide for a media yield  or generation of an acceptable margin on our media costs  that provides a sound financial outcome for us 
to deliver leads  clicks  calls  and customers to our clients  generally we own or access targeted media  run advertisements or other forms of marketing messages and programs in that media to create visitor responses in the form most typically of leads visitor generated contact information and requests  clicks to further qualification or matching steps  or to online client applications or offerings  or calls to our owned and operated call centers or that of our clients or their agents  match these leads  clicks  calls  or customers to client offerings or brands that we believe can meet visitor interests or needs  converting visitors into qualified leads  clicks  calls  or customers for our clients  and optimize client matches and media yield such that we achieve desired results for clients and a sound financial outcome for us 
our primary financial objective has been and remains creating revenue growth from sustainable sources  at target levels of profitability 
our primary financial objective is not to maximize profits  but rather to achieve target levels of profitability while investing in various growth initiatives  as we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a large  long term market 
our direct marketing services dms  business accounted for substantially all of our net revenue in fiscal years  and our dms business derives its net revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads  clicks  calls or customers and  to a lesser extent  display advertisements  or impressions 
through a vertical focus  targeted media presence and our technology platform  we are able to deliver targeted  measurable marketing results to our clients 
our two largest client verticals within our dms business are education and financial services 
our education client vertical represented  and of net revenue in fiscal years  and our financial services client vertical represented  and of net revenue in fiscal years  and other dms client verticals  consisting primarily of business to business technology  home services and medical  represented  and of net revenue in fiscal years  and 
table of contents in addition  we derived less than of our net revenue in fiscal years  and from the provision of a hosted solution and related services for clients in the direct selling industry  also referred to as our direct selling services dss business 
we generated substantially all of our revenue from sales to clients in the united states 
trends affecting our business client verticals to date  we have generated the majority of our revenue from clients in our education and financial services client verticals 
we expect that a majority of our revenue in fiscal year will be generated from clients in these two client verticals 
our education client vertical has been significantly affected by the adoption of regulations affecting for profit educational institutions over the past several years 
the regulations have affected and are expected to continue to affect our clients businesses and marketing practices  including an overall decrease in our clients external marketing expenditures 
the effect of these regulations or any future regulations may continue to result in fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients 
our financial services client vertical continued to be negatively affected due to reduced availability of high quality media at acceptable margins caused by changes in search engine algorithms  acquisition of media sources by competitors and increased competition for quality media 
these effects may continue to impact our business in the near future 
acquisitions acquisitions in fiscal year we did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal year acquisitions in fiscal year in february  we acquired certain assets of ziff davis enterprise from enterprise media group  inc  a new york based online media and marketing company in the business to business technology market  in exchange for million in cash  to broaden our registered user database and brand name in the business to business technology market 
in august  we acquired of the outstanding equity interests of narrowcast group  llc  or it businessedge  a kentucky based internet media company in the business to business technology market  in exchange for million in cash  to broaden our registered user database and media access in the business to business technology market 
during fiscal year  in addition to certain assets of ziff davis enterprise and all of the equity interests of it businessedge  we acquired eleven other online publishing businesses 
acquisitions in fiscal year in november  we acquired of the outstanding shares of car insurance 
com  inc  or carinsurance 
com  a florida based online insurance business  and certain of its affiliated companies  in exchange for million in cash  for its capacity to generate online visitors in the financial services market 
in july  we acquired the website business insurance 
com from insurance 
com group  inc  an ohio based online insurance business  in exchange for million in cash and the issuance of a million non interest bearing  unsecured promissory note  for its capacity to generate online visitors in the financial services market 
during fiscal year  in addition to the acquisitions of carinsurance 
com and insurance 
com  we acquired other online publishing businesses 

table of contents development  acquisition and retention of targeted media one of the primary challenges of our business is acquiring or creating media that is high quality and targeted enough to attract prospects for our clients at costs that work for our business model 
in order to grow our business  we must be able to develop or acquire and retain quality targeted media on a cost effective basis 
changes in search engine algorithms  our ability to develop or acquire and retain high quality targeted media and increased competition on available media has  during some periods  limited and may continue to limit our ability to generate revenue 
seasonality our results are subject to significant fluctuation as a result of seasonality 
in particular  our quarters ending december our second fiscal quarter are typically characterized by seasonal weakness 
in our second fiscal quarters  there is lower availability of lead supply from some forms of media during the holiday period on a cost effective basis and some of our clients have lower budgets 
in our quarters ending march our third fiscal quarter  this trend generally reverses with better lead availability and often new budgets at the beginning of the year for our clients with fiscal years ending december regulations our revenue has fluctuated as a result of newly adopted or amended regulations and the increased enforcement of existing regulations 
our business is affected directly because we operate websites and conduct telemarketing and email marketing  and indirectly as clients in our education and financial services client verticals adjust their operations as a result of regulatory changes that affect their industries 
one example of recent regulatory change that may affect our business is the tcpa  which the federal communications commission recently amended  among other things  impose heightened consent and opt out requirements that companies conducting telemarketing must follow 
certain provisions of the regulations became effective in july  and additional regulations requiring prior express written consent for telemarketing calls to wireless numbers become effective in october we generate a significant amount of revenue from calls made by our internal call centers as well as by third party call centers 
our efforts to comply with the new regulations may negatively affect media conversion rates and  thus  our revenue or profitability 
in addition  our education client vertical has been significantly affected by the adoption of regulations affecting for profit educational institutions over the past several years  and a higher level of legislative scrutiny is expected to continue 
clients in our financial services vertical have increasingly been affected by laws and regulations as a result of the adoption of new regulations under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the increased enforcement of new and pre existing laws and regulations 
the effect of these regulations  or any future regulations  may continue to result in fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients 
basis of presentation general we operate in two segments dms and dss 
see note  segment information  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and financial information regarding our reporting segments 
net revenue dms 
our dms business generates revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads  clicks  calls  customers and  to a lesser extent  display advertisements  or impressions 
we deliver targeted and measurable results through a vertical focus that we classify into the following client verticals education  financial services and other which includes business to business technology  home services and medical 

table of contents dss 
our dss business generated less than of net revenue in fiscal years  and we expect dss to continue to represent an immaterial portion of our business 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of media costs  personnel costs  amortization of intangible assets  depreciation expense and amortization of internal software development costs relating to revenue producing technologies 
media costs consist primarily of fees paid to website publishers that are directly related to a revenue generating event and pay per click  or ppc  ad purchases from internet search companies

costs associated with software incurred in the development phase or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized in cost of revenue over the software s estimated useful life 
we anticipate that our cost of revenue will increase more than our revenue in the near term as we invest in opportunities we see in the financial services client vertical 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories product development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative 
our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and  to a lesser extent  professional services fees  rent and other costs

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and  to a lesser extent  professional services fees  travel costs and advertising

however  we expect general and administrative expenses  including increased legal and accounting costs to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and expand our business internationally 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest expense  other income and expense  net and interest income

see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our deferred tax assets 
selected quarterly financial data the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for the eight quarters ended june  we have prepared the statements of operations for each of these quarters on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and  in the opinion of management  each statement of operations includes all adjustments  consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods 
this 
table of contents information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

adjusted ebitda our use of adjusted ebitda 
we include adjusted ebitda in this report because i we seek to manage our business to a consistent level of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue  ii it is a key basis upon which our management assesses our operating performance  iii it is one of the primary metrics investors use in evaluating internet marketing companies  iv it is a factor in the evaluation of the performance of our management in determining compensation  and v it is an element of certain financial covenants under our debt agreements 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income less benefit from provision for taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense  stock based compensation expense  interest  other income expense  net  and impairment of goodwill 
we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in 
table of contents effective tax rates or fluctuations in permanent differences or discrete quarterly items and the non cash impact of depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense  and impairment of goodwill 
since adjusted ebitda facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use adjusted ebitda for business planning purposes  to incentivize and compensate our management personnel and in evaluating acquisition opportunities 
in addition  we believe adjusted ebitda and similar measures are widely used by investors  securities analysts  ratings agencies and other interested parties in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities 
our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing stock based compensation to our management team and employees  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness  adjusted ebitda does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us  and other companies  including companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda measures differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure 
due to these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
when evaluating our performance  adjusted ebitda should be considered alongside other financial performance measures  including various cash flow metrics  net loss income and our other gaap results 
the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss income  the most comparable gaap measure  for each of the periods indicated three months ended june  mar  dec  sept  june  mar  dec  sept  in thousands net loss income interest and other income expense  net provision for benefit from taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense impairment of goodwill adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue 
table of contents adjusted ebitda quarterly trends 
we seek to manage our business to a consistent level of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue 
we do so on a fiscal year basis by varying our operations to balance revenue growth and costs throughout the fiscal year 
we do not seek to manage our business to a consistent level of adjusted ebitda on a quarterly basis and we expect our adjusted ebitda margins to vary from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million  short term marketable securities of million  cash we expect to generate from operations  and our million revolving credit line  which is committed until november  a portion of which is available to be drawn subject to compliance with applicable covenants 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 
our short term and long term liquidity requirements primarily arise from our working capital requirements  debt service on our million term loan balance at june   and acquisitions from time to time 
our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of media costs  personnel costs  costs of information technology systems and office facilities 
our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows  which are determined  in part  by future operating performance and are  therefore  subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  and also our ability to access our credit facility 
even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to obtain additional debt or equity securities or draw down on or increase our borrowing capacity under our current credit facility for other reasons 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  cash generated from operations and our available borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next months

credit facility in november  we entered into the second amended and restated revolving credit and term loan agreement second loan agreement with comerica bank the bank  the administrative agent and lead arranger 
the second loan agreement consists of a million five year term loan  with annual principal amortization of    and  and a million five year revolving credit line 
on february   we entered into the first amendment to credit agreement and amendment to guaranty first amendment to the second loan agreement with the bank to  among other things amend the definition of adjusted ebitda  effective as of december   to exclude extraordinary or non recurring non cash expenses of losses including  without limitation  goodwill impairments  and any extraordinary or non recurring cash expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed million for the life of the second loan agreement  and reduce the million five year revolving credit line portion of the facility to million  effective as of february  
table of contents borrowings under the second loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
interest is payable at specified margins above either the eurodollar margin or the prime rate 
the interest rate varies based upon the ratio of funded debt to adjusted ebitda and ranges from eurodollar margin to or prime for the revolving credit line and from eurodollar margin to or prime for the term loan 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net loss income less benefit from provision for taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense  stock based compensation expense  interest and other income expense  acquisition costs for business combinations  extraordinary or non recurring non cash expenses of losses including  without limitation  goodwill impairments  and any extraordinary or non recurring cash expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed million for the life of this second loan agreement

to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under the term loan  on february   we entered into an interest rate swap encompassing the principal balances scheduled to be outstanding in january and thereafter  such principal amount totaling million in january and amortizing to million in november the interest rate swap effectively fixes the eurodollar margin at 
the second loan agreement expires in november the second loan agreement restricts our ability to raise additional debt financing and pay dividends  and also requires us to comply with other nonfinancial covenants 
in addition  we are required to maintain financial ratios computed as follows a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  calculated as the ratio of i trailing twelve months of adjusted ebitda to ii the sum of capital expenditures  net cash interest expense  cash taxes  cash dividends and trailing twelve months payments of indebtedness 
payment of unsecured indebtedness is excluded to the degree that sufficient unused revolving credit line capacity exists such that the relevant debt payment could be made from the credit facility

we were in compliance with the covenants of our loan agreements as of june  and upfront arrangement fees incurred in connection with the first amendment of the second loan agreements totaled million and were deferred and will be amortized over the remaining term of the arrangement 
in connection with the reduction of the revolving credit line capacity  during the third quarter of fiscal year we accelerated amortization of approximately million of unamortized deferred upfront costs 
interest rate swap as described above  we entered into an interest rate swap to reduce our exposure to the financial impact of changing interest rates under our term loan 
we do not speculate using derivative instruments 
the effective date of the swap is april  with a maturity date of november  at june   we had approximately million of notional amount outstanding under the swap agreement that exchanges a variable interest rate base eurodollar margin for a fixed interest rate of over the term of the agreement 
this interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge of the interest rate risk attributable to forecasted variable interest payments 
the effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on this swap will be included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
at june   our interest rate swap qualified as a cash flow hedge 
for this qualifying hedge  the effective portion of the change in fair value will be recognized through earnings when the underlying transaction being hedged affects earnings  thereby allowing the swap s gains and losses to offset interest expense from the term loan on the statement of operations 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the current period

after this month period  monthly base rent increased to million for the subsequent months and then increases approximately after each month anniversary during the remaining term  including any extensions under our options to extend 
we have two options to extend the term of the lease for one additional year for each option following the expiration date of the lease or renewal term  as applicable 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in doing so  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we believe that a discussion of these policies is necessary to understand and evaluate the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
see note  summary of significant accounting principles  of our consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from two sources dms and dss 
dms revenue is derived primarily from fees which are earned through the delivery of qualified leads  clicks  calls  customers and  to a lesser extent  display advertisements  or impressions 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time a qualified lead or click is delivered to the client provided that no significant obligations remain 
under our revenue recognition policies  we allocate revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price esp of deliverables if vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price based on historical stand alone sales or third party evidence tpe of selling price does not exist 
due to the unique nature of some of our multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  we may not be able to establish selling prices based on historical stand alone sales or third party evidence  therefore we may use our best estimate to establish selling prices for these arrangements under the new standard 
we establish best estimates within a range of selling prices considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  factors such as class of client  size of transaction  available media inventory  pricing strategies and market conditions 
we believe the use of the best estimate of selling price allows revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction 

table of contents from time to time  we may agree to credit a client for certain leads  clicks  calls or customers if they fail to meet the contractual or other guidelines of a particular client 
we have established a sales reserve based on historical experience 
to date  such credits have been within our expectations 
for a portion of our revenue  we have agreements with providers of online media or third party publishers used in the generation of qualified leads  clicks  calls or customers 
we receive a fee from our clients and pay a fee to publishers either on a revenue share  cost per lead  cost per click or cost per thousand impressions basis 
we are the primary obligor in the transaction 
as a result  the fees paid by our clients are recognized as revenue and the fees paid to our publishers are included in cost of revenue 
dss revenue is comprised of i set up and professional services fees and ii usage fees 
set up and professional service fees that do not provide stand alone value to a client are recognized over the contractual term of the agreement or the expected client relationship period  whichever is longer  effective when the application reaches the go live date 
we define the go live date as the date when the application enters into a production environment or all essential functionalities have been delivered 
usage fees are recognized on a monthly basis as earned 
deferred revenue is comprised of contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition 
stock based compensation we measure and record the expense related to stock based transactions based on the fair values of the awards as determined on the date of grant 
for stock options  we selected and have historically used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value 
in applying the black scholes option pricing model  our determination of fair value is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the stock options and the employees actual and projected stock option exercise and pre vesting employment termination behaviors 
since we do not have extensive trading history  we estimate the expected volatility of our common stock based on the historical volatility of comparable public companies over the stock option s expected term 
we have no history or expectation of paying dividends on our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected term of the stock options 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight line method  based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
goodwill we conduct a test for the impairment of goodwill on at least an annual basis but will conduct the test at an earlier date if indicators of possible impairment arise that would cause a triggering event 
we have two reporting units  dms and dss 
the impairment test first compares the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  to assess whether impairment is present 
our public market capitalization sustained a decline after december   to a value below the net book carrying value of our equity 
as a result  we determined that this triggered the necessity to conduct an interim goodwill impairment test 
we first tested our long lived assets related to the dms reporting unit as of december  and  based on the undiscounted cash flows  determined that these assets were not impaired 
additionally  a two step process was then required to test goodwill impairment 
to estimate the fair value for step one  we utilized a combination of income and market approaches evenly weighted to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the income approach involves discounting future estimated cash flows 
the discount rate used is the value weighted average 
table of contents of the reporting unit s estimated cost of equity and debt cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics 
we performed sensitivity tests with respect to growth rates and discount rates used in the income approach 
in applying the market approach  valuation multiples are derived from historical and projected operating data of selected peer companies  evaluated and adjusted  if necessary  based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected peer companies  and applied to the appropriate historical and or projected operating data to arrive at a fair value 
we completed step one of the impairment analysis for each of our reporting units and concluded that  as of december   the fair value of our dms reporting unit was below its carrying value  including goodwill 
as such  step two of the impairment test was initiated to determine the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal year we completed the second step of the goodwill impairment test as described above in the third quarter of fiscal year the completion of this second step did not result in an adjustment to the goodwill impairment charge previously recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year in our quarter ending june   we determined that the estimated fair value of our dms reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value 
as described above  we utilized a combination of income and market approaches evenly weighted to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the carrying value of our dms reporting unit was approximately million in our quarter ending june  the estimated fair value of our dms reporting unit was approximately million in our quarter ending june  this resulted in an excess of fair value over the carrying value of approximately million or 
the excess fair value over the carrying value in our quarter ending june  was 
the decline in the excess carrying value was primarily a result of the decline in market capitalization at the time our annual goodwill impairment test during the quarter ending june  compared to the market capitalization during the quarter ending june  in our quarter ending june   we determined that the estimated fair value of our dss reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value 
the carrying value of our dss reporting unit was approximately million in our quarter ending june  the estimated fair value of our dss reporting unit under an income approach was approximately million in our quarter ending june  based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
this resulted in a significant excess of fair value over the carrying value 
based on our re evaluation of impairment as part of our annual impairment test during the quarter ending june   we concluded that there was no additional indicator of impairment of goodwill for fiscal year the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
we base these estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units and hence the valuation of goodwill could be affected 
circumstances that could affect the valuation of goodwill include  among other things  a significant change in our market capitalization  the business climate and buying habits of our subscriber base  and with respect to the dss reporting unit  the loss of a significant customer 
the application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  the assignment of assets  liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows and determining appropriate discount rates  growth rates  an appropriate control premium and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value which could trigger impairment 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset 
table of contents may not be recoverable 
we apply judgment when estimating the fair value of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss if estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset  if any  are less than the carrying value of the asset 
as mentioned in the goodwill section above  our public market capitalization sustained a decline after december   to a value below the net book carrying value of our equity 
as such  we tested our long lived assets related to the dms reporting unit as of december  and  based on the undiscounted cash flows  determined that these assets were not impaired 
we re evaluated our long lived assets as part of our annual impairment test during the quarter ending june  and determined that there was no indicator of impairment 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to record deferred taxes 
our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded against our deferred tax assets which are not expected to be realized 
our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks 
interest rate risk we invest our cash equivalents and short term investments primarily in liquid  highly rated us government or municipal fixed income securities  certificates of deposit with financial institutions and money market funds 
unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes and acquisition financing 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have material exposure to changes in the fair value of these investments as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our investments 
declines in interest rates may reduce future investment income 
however  a hypothetical decline of in the interest rate on our investments would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as of june   our credit facility had a borrowing capacity of million with million in term loans outstanding  and no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is payable quarterly at specified margins above either the eurodollar margin or the prime rate 
our exposure to interest rate risk under the credit facility will depend on the extent to which we utilize such facility 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under the term loan  on february   we entered into an interest rate swap encompassing the principal balances scheduled to be outstanding in january and thereafter  such principal amount will total million in january and amortize to million in november the interest rate swap effectively fixes the eurodollar margin at a fixed rate of 
a hypothetical change of from prevailing interest rates as of june  would affect our interest expense and the fair value of the swap by less than million 

table of contents in addition to the million of term loans covered by the interest rate swap as of june   we also had variable rate debt outstanding of million 
a hypothetical increase of in the eurodollar margin or prime rate based interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding of million as of june  would result in an increase in our interest expense of million per year  assuming constant borrowing levels 
foreign currency exchange risk to date  our international client agreements have been predominately denominated in us dollars  and accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to client agreements  and do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
as the local accounts for some of our foreign operations are maintained in the local currency of the respective country  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement to us dollars 
a hypothetical change of in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
