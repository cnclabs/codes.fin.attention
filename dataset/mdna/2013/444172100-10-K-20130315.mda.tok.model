this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary financial information contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview of management s discussion and analysis this overview is intended to highlight selected information included in this annual report on form k 
it does not contain sufficient information for a complete understanding of the company s financial condition and operating results and  therefore  should be read in conjunction with this entire annual report on form k 
the company derives substantially all of its revenue from providing banking and related services to businesses  professionals  municipalities  not for profit organizations and individuals within its market area  primarily westchester county and rockland county  new york  portions of new york city and fairfield county and new haven county  connecticut 
the company s assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities  which are funded by deposits  borrowings and capital 
the primary source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on loans and investments  and interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
the company s strategy includes investigation of opportunities for expansion within our market area  as well as an ongoing review of our existing branch system to evaluate if our current locations have or have not met expectations for growth and profitability 
considering current economic conditions  the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk  the risk of deterioration of market values of collateral supporting the company s loan portfolio  particularly commercial and residential real estate  and potential risks associated with the impact of regulatory changes that have occurred and may continue to take place in reaction to current conditions in the financial system 
interest rate risk is the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
commercial and residential real estate are the primary collateral for the majority of the company s loans 
the company recorded net income of million or per diluted share in compared to net loss of million or per diluted share in the overall increase in earnings in  compared to  resulted primarily from a significant decrease in the provision for loan losses which totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the large provision in included million of provisions directly related to write downs associated with the transfer of million of loans to the held for sale status in the fourth quarter of  in anticipation of bulk loan sales completed in the first quarter of the loan sales were conducted to reduce the company s classified loans and overall concentration in commercial real estate loans 
the increase in earnings in  compared to  also reflected a pretax gain of million resulting from the successful completion of the aforementioned loan sales at the end of the first quarter of  partially offset by slightly lower non interest income and higher non interest expenses 
earnings in and were also affected by recognized impairment charges on securities available for sale  related to the bank s investment in pooled trust preferred securities  of million and million  respectively  and by losses on revaluation of other real estate owned of million and million  respectively 
total loans  excluding loans held for sale  decreased million to  million during the year ended december   compared to  million at the prior year end 
the overall decrease was primarily the result of pay downs and payoffs of existing loans exceeding new production and additional loan sales conducted in the second quarter of  partially offset by the purchase of adjustable rate residential loans in the first quarter of  which were purchased as partial redeployment of proceeds from sales of loans held for sale 
the company continues to provide lending availability to both new and existing customers 

table of contents nonperforming assets decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  nonperforming assets at december  included million of nonperforming loans held for sale 
the company recognized million of net charge offs during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december   of which million were related to the fourth quarter transfer of loans to held for sale 
overall asset quality continued to be adversely affected by the current state of the economy and the real estate market 
although there is evidence that the current economic downturn may have begun to slowly turn around  higher than normal levels of delinquent and nonperforming loans  slowdowns in repayments and declines in the loan to value ratios on existing loans continued during despite overall reductions in classified and nonperforming loans  the company s loan portfolio continued to be adversely impacted by the lagging effects of declines in the demand for and values of virtually all commercial and residential real estate properties 
these declines  together with the limited availability of residential mortgage financing  resulted in some continuing weakness in the overall asset quality of the company s loan portfolio 
as a result of these factors  the company has continued to follow aggressive strategies for resolving problem assets and has maintained the allowance for loan losses at a higher than normal level 
the provision for loan losses for was million compared to million in the provision was lower than in reflecting improvements achieved in the resolutions of classified and nonperforming loans 
the provision in included million of charges directly related to write downs associated with the transfer of million of loans to the held for sale status in the fourth quarter of  in anticipation of bulk loans sales completed in the first quarter of total deposits increased million during the year ended december   compared to the prior year end 
the company continued to emphasize its core deposit growth  while placing less emphasis on non core deposits including deposits which are obtained on a bid basis 
liquidity from deposit growth  loan sales  and excess loan and investment repayments over new production was retained in the company s short term liquidity portfolios  available to fund future loan growth 
with interest rates remaining at historical low levels  this increase in liquidity contributed to significant margin compression 
the net interest margin was percent and percent  for the years ended december   and december   respectively 
the company expects some additional net interest margin compression in future quarters due to maturing loans and investments being reinvested at lower interest rates and until redeployment of the excess proceeds from the recent loan sales and other maturing assets can be completed in a manner consistent with both the company s risk management policies and the requirements of the occ 
regardless of the timing of the aforementioned redeployment  if interest rates continue at current levels  it is expected that additional downward pressure on net interest margin will continue 
as a result of the aforementioned activity in the company s core businesses of loans and deposits and other asset liability management activities  tax equivalent basis net interest income decreased by million or percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in addition to evaluating hudson valley holding corp s results of operations in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non gaap financial measures 
management believes that these non gaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding hudson valley holding corp s underlying operating performance and trends  and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks 
tax equivalent basis net interest income is a non gaap financial measure 
net interest income in accordance with gaap decreased by million or percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  a tabular gaap reconciliation of net interest income is included in the average balances and interest rates section 
non interest income was million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the overall increase resulted primarily from a million pretax gain on sales of loans completed in the first quarter of and higher other income  partially offset by lower service fees  lower investment advisory fees and higher impairment charges on securities available for sale 
investment advisory fee 
table of contents income was lower in primarily as a result of the effects of continued fluctuation in both domestic and international equity markets 
service charges decreased due to decreased activity 
pre tax impairment charges on securities available for sale were million in and million in the impairment charges were related to the company s investments in pooled trust preferred securities 
non interest income also included losses on revaluation of other real estate owned of million in and million in non interest expense increased million or percent to million in  compared to million in  which increased million or percent compared to million in the increase in  compared to  resulted primarily from increases in investments in technology and personnel to accommodate expanding risk management requirements and growth and the expansion of services and products available to new and existing customers and an increase in fdic insurance  partially offset by decreases in costs associated with problem loan resolution 
the office of comptroller of the currency occ has directed greater scrutiny to banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans 
during the fourth quarter of  the occ required hvb to maintain  by december   a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
these capital levels are in excess of well capitalized levels generally applicable to banks under current regulations 
the company and hvb have continuously exceeded all required regulatory capital ratios 
on february   hudson valley announced that during a routine exam and discussions with the occ  hvb was made aware that it would be required to reduce its concentration in commercial real estate loans  including multi family lending  as well as classified loans 
as previously disclosed  the company s response to these discussions with the occ included a commitment to reduce concentrations of cre loans and classified assets to less than percent and percent of risk based capital  respectively  in the near term 
as a result of the loan sales completed in the first quarter of  and other resolution efforts  the company reduced cre loans to percent of risk based capital from percent at the end of  while lowering classified assets to percent of risk based capital 
classified assets ranged between percent and percent of risk based capital in  before the impact of loan marks at december  also on february   hudson valley announced its new dividend policy capping dividend payments at no more than percent of net income in  and in future periods if cre loans and classified assets exceed percent and percent of risk based capital  respectively 
on april   the board of directors of hudson valley bank signed a formal written agreement with the occ 
with this agreement  hudson valley is committing to adopt best practices modeled on those of the nation s larger financial institutions  as well as evolving expectations of regulatory agencies on community banks 
included in the agreed upon commitments are enhancements to the hvb s procedures  systems  policies  programs  plans  training and resources 
the agreement is consistent with the cre lending and classified asset concentration commitments hudson valley announced on february  the written agreement imposes no specific capital ratio mandates or other quantitative conditions or obligations on hudson valley and does not impose any limit on the hvb board s ability to pay dividends to its parent  except those imposed by the law 
during the second quarter of  the bank submitted a capital plan to the occ  which included provisions regarding the payment of dividend by hvb  as required under the written agreement 
the bank is operating in accordance with its capital plan without supervisory objection from the occ 
on january   the company announced that is was reducing its quarterly dividend to per share 
critical accounting policies application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s 
table of contents significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require management to make estimates and judgements  and therefore  are critical to understanding the company s results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
securities securities are classified as either available for sale  representing securities the company may sell in the ordinary course of business  or as held to maturity  representing securities that the company has determined that it is more likely than not that it would not be required to sell prior to maturity or recovery of cost 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax excluded from operations and reported in other comprehensive income 
securities held to maturity are stated at amortized cost 
interest income includes amortization of purchase premium and accretion of purchase discount 
the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is determined by using the level yield method 
securities are not acquired for purposes of engaging in trading activities 
realized gains and losses from sales of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
the company regularly reviews declines in the fair value of securities below their costs for purposes of determining whether such declines are other than temporary in nature 
in estimating other than temporary impairment otti  management considers adverse changes in expected cash flows  the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
the company also assesses whether it intends to sell  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell  a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if either of these criteria is met  the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings 
for securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria  the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows otti related to credit loss  which must be recognized in the income statement and otti related to other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
the credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis 
loans held for sale loan sales occur in limited circumstances as part of strategic business or regulatory compliance initiatives 
loans held for sale  including deferred fees and costs  are reported at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by expected bid prices from potential investors 
loans held for sale are segregated into pools based on distinct criteria and the lower of cost or fair value analysis is performed at the pool level 
loans are sold without recourse and servicing released 
when a loan is transferred from portfolio to held for sale and the fair value is less than cost  a charge off is recorded against the allowance for loan loss 
subsequent declines in fair value  if any  are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged against earnings 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of a specific component for identified problem loans  and a formula component which addresses historical loan loss experience together with other relevant risk factors affecting the portfolio 
this methodology applies to all portfolio segments 
the specific component incorporates the company s analysis of impaired loans 
these accounting standards prescribe the measurement methods  income recognition and disclosures related to impaired loans 
a loan is recognized as impaired when it is probable that principal and or interest are not collectible in accordance with the loan s contractual terms 
in addition  a loan which has been renegotiated with a borrower experiencing financial difficulties for which the terms of the loan have been modified with a concession that the company would not otherwise have granted are considered troubled debt restructurings and are also recognized as impaired 
measurement of impairment can be based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the 
table of contents loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  taking into account estimated selling costs  if the loan is collateral dependent 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change 
if the fair value of an impaired loan is less than the related recorded amount  a specific valuation component is established within the allowance for loan losses or  if the impairment is considered to be permanent  a full or partial charge off is recorded against the allowance for loan losses 
triggering events that may impact the company s decision to record a specific reserve instead of a partial charge off on impaired loans typically involve some uncertainty as to the amount of permanent loss to be recorded 
examples include ongoing negotiations with a borrower  new appraisals or other collateral evaluations not yet received or completed and other factors where the decision to record a charge off is considered premature 
the company has groups of smaller balance homogenous loans which are collectively reviewed for impairment 
these groups include residential family loans  home equity lines of credit and consumer loans 
these loans are not individually risk rated while performing 
they are either charged off or evaluated for impairment after days delinquency 
the formula component is calculated by first applying historical loss experience factors to outstanding loans by type 
the company uses a three year average loss experience as the starting base for the formula component 
this component is then adjusted to reflect additional risk factors not addressed by historical loss experience 
these factors include the evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company and other conditions  such as new loan products  credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  recent charge off and delinquency experience  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectability of the loan portfolio 
senior management reviews these conditions quarterly 
management s evaluation of the loss related to each of these conditions is quantified by portfolio segment and reflected in the formula component 
the evaluations of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty due to the subjective nature of such evaluations and because they are not identified with specific problem credits 
actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company s methodology permits adjustments to the allowance in the event that  in management s judgment  significant factors which affect the collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date have changed 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is the best estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of december  there is no assurance that the company will not be required to make future adjustments to the allowance for possible adverse effects on borrowers or collateral values that may result from widespread damage caused by hurricane sandy  or in response to changing economic conditions  particularly in the company s service area  since the majority of the company s loans are collateralized by real estate 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments at the time of their examinations 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization 
identified intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over those lives by a method which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are used up 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
identifiable intangible assets are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
if such testing indicates impairment in the values and or remaining amortization periods of the intangible assets  adjustments are made to reflect such impairment 
the company s goodwill impairment evaluations as of december  and december  did not indicate any impairment 
the company is not aware of any events or circumstances that existed with the identified intangible assets that would indicate impairment as of december  and december   and through the date of the filing 

table of contents loss contingencies loss contingencies  including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business  are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
legal fees associated with loss contingencies are included in loss contingency accruals 
income taxes income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the change is enacted 
stock based compensation compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions are recognized in the financial statements with measurement based upon the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation costs related to share based payment transactions are expensed over their respective vesting periods 
the fair value present value of the estimated future benefit to the option holder of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model

results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  summary of results during the three years ended december   the company has experienced an extended period of severe negative economic conditions and historically low interest rates 
these conditions have resulted in sharp declines in the value of collateral securing many of the company s loans  elevated levels of classified and nonperforming loans  weak loan demand and declining margins 
in addition  a dynamically changing regulatory landscape has resulted in greater scrutiny of the historic business models of smaller community based institutions 
this has resulted in greater pressure on many community banks to reduce loan concentrations  particularly commercial real estate loans  and to accelerate the reduction of levels of nonperforming and classified loans 
the company reported net income of million or per diluted share in compared to net loss of million or per diluted share in and net income of million or per diluted share in the overall increase in earnings in  compared to  resulted primarily from a million decrease in the provision for loan losses  partially offset by a million decrease in net interest income in  compared to the provision in included million of charges directly related to write downs associated with the transfer of million of loans to the held for sale status in the fourth quarter of  in anticipation of bulk loan sales completed in the first quarter of the loan sales were conducted to reduce the company s classified loans and overall concentration in commercial real estate loans 
the decrease in net interest income in  compared to  was primarily due to significant margin compression resulting from the combined impacts of only partial redeployment of proceeds from loan sales completed in the first quarter of and the continuation of historically low interest rates 
the overall increase in earnings in  compared to  also reflected a pretax gain of million resulting from the successful completion of the aforementioned loan sales at the end of the first quarter of  partially offset by slightly lower non interest income and higher non interest expenses

table of contents provisions for loan losses totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively

adjusted average stockholders equity excludes the effects of net unrealized gains  net of tax of million  million and million on securities available for sale in  and  respectively 
the annualized return on adjusted average stockholders equity is  under sec regulations  a non gaap financial measure 
management believes that this non gaap financial measure more closely reflects actual performance  as it is more consistent with the company s stated asset liability management strategies  which do not contemplate significant realization of market gains or losses on securities available for sale which were primarily related to changes in interest rates or illiquidity in the marketplace

table of contents net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the most significant component of the company s consolidated earnings 
the company has experienced an extended period of severe negative economic conditions and historically low interest rates 
these conditions have resulted in sharp declines in the value of collateral securing many of the company s loans  elevated levels of classified and nonperforming loans  weak loan demand and declining margins 
in addition  a dynamically changing regulatory landscape has resulted in greater scrutiny of the historic business models of smaller community based institutions 
this has resulted in greater pressure on many community banks to reduce loan concentrations  particularly commercial real estate loans  and to accelerate the reduction of levels of nonperforming and classified loans 
during this period of economic difficulty and low interest rates  the company took various steps to address these issues 
these steps included repositioning its securities portfolio  reducing higher cost term borrowings and  during the first half of  executing significant loan sales for the purpose of reducing commercial real estate concentrations and overall levels of classified and nonperforming loans 
these actions have resulted in significant margin compression  particularly in  as a result of the impact of only partial redeployment of proceeds from loan sales completed in the first quarter of together with the continuation of historically low interest rate levels 
as a result of these differentials in redeployment and average yields  together with the current historically low interest rate environment  the company expects additional margin compression will result in the near term  particularly during the period of redeployment of the remaining proceeds from the loan sales 
the company is in the process of implementing new lending initiatives designed to address both near and long term redeployment of available liquidity and diversification of the balance sheet 
these initiatives include asset purchases  loan participations with other institutions and the development of internal ability to originate  underwrite and service leasing and other non commercial real estate credits 
management believes that the results of these efforts will enable the company  given the difficulties encountered during the recent financial crisis  to maximize its net interest income  address regulatory concerns  and effectively reposition its portfolios from both asset composition and interest rate risk perspectives 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased million or percent to million in  compared to million in  which increased million or percent from million in the decrease in  compared to  was due primarily to a decrease in the tax equivalent basis net interest margin to percent in  compared to percent in this decrease resulted from the aforementioned significant changes in the composition of interest earning assets resulting from the combined effects of loan sales conducted in the first quarter of  generally weak new loan demand and continued low interest rates 
the decrease was partially offset by a million or percent increase in the excess of adjusted average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities to  million in  from million in the increase in  compared to  resulted primarily from an increase in the tax equivalent basis net interest margin to percent in from percent in  which was attributable to an increase of million or percent in the excess of adjusted average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities to million in from million in for purposes of the financial information included in this section  the company adjusts average interest earning assets to exclude the effects of unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and adjusts net interest income to a tax equivalent basis 
management believes that this alternate presentation more closely reflects actual performance  as it is consistent with the company s stated asset liability management strategies 
net interest income in accordance with gaap decreased by million or percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the effects of these non gaap adjustments to tax equivalent basis net interest income and adjusted average assets are included in the table presented in the average balances and interest rates section herein 
the company s overall asset quality has improved as a result of actions taken by management to reduce concentrations and classified assets 
however  asset quality has continued to be adversely affected by the current state of the economy and it has continued to experience elevated levels of delinquent and nonperforming loans  and declines in the loan to value ratios on existing loans 
changes in the levels of nonperforming loans have a direct impact on net interest income 

table of contents the company s short term liquidity remains at elevated levels  resulting from continued deposit growth  soft loan demand and proceeds from recent loan sales which have not as yet been redeployed 
this excess liquidity contributed to margin compression 
the company has made efforts throughout the extended period of severe economic uncertainty and fluctuating interest rates to minimize the impact on its net interest income by appropriately repositioning its securities portfolio and funding sources while maintaining prudence and awareness of the potential consequences that the current economic crisis could have on its asset quality and interest rate risk profiles 
the company continues to increase the number of loans originated with interest rate floors and exercise caution in reinvestment of excess liquidity provided from continued strong deposit growth and proceeds from loan sales 
these actions are being conducted partially to maintain flexibility in reaction to the continuation of historically low interest rates 
the company s ability to make changes in its asset mix allows management to capitalize on more desirable yields  as available  on various interest earning assets 
interest income is determined by the volume of and related rates earned on interest earning assets 
volume decreases in loans and investments and a lower average yield on interest earning assets  partially offset by volume increases in interest earning deposits and federal funds sold resulted in lower interest income in  compared to volume decreases in investments  interest earning deposits and federal funds sold and a lower average yield on interest earning assets  partially offset by volume increases in loans resulted in slightly lower interest income in  compared to adjusted average interest earning assets in increased million  or percent  to  million from  million in  which increased million  or percent  from  million in loans are the largest component of interest earning assets

the company performs extensive ongoing asset quality monitoring by both internal and independent loan review functions 
in addition  the company conducts timely remediation and collection activities through a network of internal and external resources which include an internal asset recovery department  real estate and other loan workout attorneys and external collection agencies

see allowance for loan losses below for further discussion of this strategy 
management believes that these efforts are appropriate for accomplishing either successful remediation or maximizing collections related to nonperforming assets 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of a specific component for identified problem loans and a formula component to consider historical loan loss experience and additional risk factors affecting the portfolio 

table of contents a summary of the components of the allowance for loan losses  changes in the components and the impact of charge offs recoveries on the resulting provision for loan losses for the years ended december is as follows s change during change during change during change during change during components specific real estate commercial construction residential commercial and industrial lease financing and other total specific component formula real estate commercial construction residential commercial and industrial lease financing and other total formula component total allowance net change net charge offs provision for loan losses coverage ratio coverage ratio excluding partial chargeoffs net chargeoffs include partial chargeoffs of     and related nonperforming and impaired loans for the years ended december     and  respectively 
the coverage ratio is the allowance for loan losses divided by total nonperforming loans 
the specific component of the allowance for loan losses is the result of our analysis of impaired loans and our determination of the amount required to reduce the carrying amount of such loans to estimated fair value 
accordingly  such allowance is dependent on the particular loans and their characteristics at each measurement date  not necessarily the total amount of such loans 
the company usually records partial charge offs as opposed to specific reserves for impaired loans that are real estate collateral dependent and for which independent appraisals have determined the fair value of the collateral to be less than the carrying amount of the loan 
partial charge offs can significantly impact the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans coverage ratio and other credit loss statistics and trends due to the fact that  in this situation  the allowance for loan loss is reduced and the remaining loan balance continues to be carried in nonperforming loans 
at december   and  the company had million  million  and million  respectively  of impaired loans for which million  million  and million of partial charge offs  respectively  had been recorded 
at december   the company had no specific reserves allocated as partial charge offs were recorded for all identified impairments 
there was a million specific reserve 
table of contents allocated to one impaired loan as of december  and a million specific reserve allocated to three impaired loans as of december  the company s analyses as of december  and december  indicated that impaired loans were principally real estate collateral dependent and that  with the exception of those loans for which specific reserves were assigned  there was sufficient underlying collateral value or guarantees to indicate expected recovery of the carrying amount of the loans 
the changes in the formula component of the allowance for loan losses are the result of the application of historical loss experience to outstanding loans by type 
loss experience for each year is based upon average charge off experience for the prior three year period by loan type 
the formula component is then adjusted to reflect changes in other relevant factors affecting loan collectability 
loss experience factors for new products  such as the residential multi family program implemented in and  were supplemented with additional factors such as industry loss experience and add ons for new product and concentration risk 
management periodically adjusted the formula component to an amount that  when considered with the specific component  represented its best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date

the company s methodology permits adjustments to the allowance in the event that  in management s judgment  significant factors which affect the collectibility of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date have changed 
by assessing the estimated losses probable in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  the bank is able to adjust specific and probable loss estimates based upon any more recent information that has become available 
other pertinent information related to the company s allowance for loan losses is contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented in this form k 

table of contents management believes the allowance for loan losses is the best estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of december  there is no assurance that the company will not be required to make future adjustments to the allowance in response to changing economic conditions or regulatory examinations 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million during  million for and million in the provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the company s allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors previously discussed under allowance for loan losses 
deposits the company s fundamental source of funds supporting interest earning assets is deposits  consisting of non interest bearing demand deposits  checking with interest  money market  savings and various forms of time deposits 
the maintenance of a strong deposit base is key to the development of lending opportunities and creates long term customer relationships  which enhance the ability to cross sell services 
depositors include businesses  professionals  municipalities  not for profit organizations and individuals 
to meet the requirements of a diverse customer base  a full range of deposit instruments are offered  which has allowed the company to maintain and expand its deposit base despite intense competition from other banking institutions and non bank financial service providers 
total deposits at december  increased million or percent to  million  from  million at december   which increased million or percent from  million at december  the company has experienced significant growth in new customers both in existing branches and new branches added during and this growth was partially offset by some declines in balances of existing customers  primarily those customers directly involved in or supported by the real estate industry 
proceeds from deposit growth were used primarily to reduce long term and short term borrowings and to fund loan growth 
the company had no brokered certificates of deposit at december  and the following table presents a summary of deposits at december s demand deposits money market accounts savings accounts time deposits of  or more time deposits of less than  checking with interest total deposits the following table presents deposits classified by time remaining to maturity as of the dates indicated in thousands december  time deposits of  or more time deposits of  or less total time deposits time deposits of  or more time deposits of  or less total time deposits months or less over months through months over months through months over months total

these cd s are primarily short term and are acquired on a bid basis 
time deposits of over  generally have maturities of days to one year 
the company also from time to time utilizes wholesale borrowings  brokered deposits and other sources of funds interchangeably with time deposits in excess of  depending upon availability and rates paid for such funds at any point in time 
due to the generally short maturity of these funding sources  the company can experience higher volatility of interest margins during periods of both rising and declining interest rates

as of december   hvb had short term borrowing lines with the fhlb of million with no amounts outstanding 
these and various other fhlb borrowing programs available to members are subject to availability of qualifying loan and or investment securities collateral and other terms and conditions 
hvb also has unsecured overnight borrowing lines totaling million with three major financial institutions which were all unused and available at december  in addition  hvb has approved lines under retail certificate of deposit agreements with three major financial institutions totaling billion of which no balances were outstanding as at december  utilization of these lines are subject to product availability and other restrictions 
additional liquidity is also provided by the company s ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank s discount window 
in response to the current economic crisis  the federal reserve bank has increased the ability of banks to borrow from this source through its borrower in custody bic program  which expanded the types of collateral which qualify as security for such borrowings 
hvb has been approved to participate in the bic program 
there were no balances outstanding with the federal reserve at december  
table of contents as of december   the company had qualifying loan and investment securities totaling approximately million which could be utilized under available borrowing programs thereby increasing liquidity 
capital resources stockholders equity increased million or percent to million at december  from million at december   which decreased million or percent from million at december  the increase resulted from net income of million and net proceeds from stock options of million and restricted stock of million which was partially offset by cash dividends of million and a decrease of accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
the decrease resulted from cash dividends of million and net loss of million which was partially offset by net proceeds from exercises of stock options of million and an increase of accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
hvb s payment of dividends to the company  the company s primary source of funds  is subject to limitation by federal and state regulators based on such factors as the maintenance of adequate capital  which could reduce the amount of dividends otherwise payable 
see business supervision and regulation 
the various components and changes in stockholders equity are reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity for the years ended december   and included elsewhere herein 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a supervisory letter dated february  to bank holding companies that contains guidance on when the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate  defer or severely limit dividends including  for example  when net income available for stockholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends 
the letter also contains guidance on the redemption of stock by bank holding companies which urges bank holding companies to advise the federal reserve of any such redemption or repurchase of common stock for cash or other value which results in the net reduction of a bank holding company s capital during the quarter 
all banks and bank holding companies are subject to risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines define capital as tier and total capital 
tier capital consists of common stockholders equity and qualifying preferred stock  less intangibles  and total capital consists of tier capital plus the allowance for loan losses up to certain limits  preferred stock and certain subordinated and term debt securities 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of percent  and a minimum tier risk based capital ratio of percent 
banks and bank holding companies must also maintain a minimum leverage ratio of percent  which consists of tier capital based on risk based capital guidelines  divided by average tangible assets excluding intangible assets that were deducted to arrive at tier capital 
in today s economic and regulatory environment  banking regulators  including the occ  which is the primary federal regulator of the bank  are directing greater scrutiny to banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans 
due to the concentration of commercial real estate loans in our portfolio  we are among the banks subject to such greater regulatory scrutiny 
as a result of this concentration  the level of our non performing loans  and the potential for further possible deterioration in our loan portfolio  the occ required hvb to maintain  since december   a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent compared to percent for a well capitalized bank  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent compared to percent for a well capitalized bank  and a tier leverage ratio of at least percent compared to percent for a well capitalized bank 
these capital levels are in excess of well capitalized levels generally applicable to banks under current regulations 

table of contents the capital ratios at december are as follows tier capital company hvb total capital company hvb leverage company hvb in connection with the company s efforts to reduce certain asset concentrations as they relate to capital  the board has adopted a dividend policy to cap dividend payments going forward at no more than percent of quarterly net income in and in future periods if commercial real estate loans and classified assets exceed percent and percent of risk based capital  respectively 
on january   the company announced that it was reducing its quarterly dividend to cash per share 
management intends to conduct the affairs of the bank so as to maintain a strong capital position in the future 
liquidity the asset liability strategic committee alsc of the board of directors of hvb establishes specific policies and operating procedures governing the company s liquidity levels and develops plans to address future liquidity needs  including contingent sources of liquidity 
the primary functions of asset liability management are to provide safety of depositor and investor funds  assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirement of depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to manage fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the company s liquid assets  at december   include cash and due from banks of million and federal funds sold of million 
federal funds sold represents the company s excess liquid funds that are invested with other financial institutions in need of funds and which mature daily 
other sources of liquidity include maturities and principal and interest payments on loans and securities 
the loan and securities portfolios provide a constant stream of maturing assets and reinvestable cash flows  which can be converted into cash should the need arise 
the ability to redeploy these funds is an important source of medium to long term liquidity 
the amortized cost of securities having contractual maturities  expected call dates or average lives of one year or less amounted to million at december  this represented percent of the amortized cost of the securities portfolio 
excluding installment loans to individuals  real estate loans other than construction loans and lease financing  million  or percent of loans at december   mature in one year or less 
the company may increase liquidity by selling certain residential mortgages  or exchanging them for mortgage backed securities that may be sold in the secondary market 
non interest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing deposits from businesses  professionals  not for profit organizations and individuals are a relatively stable  low cost source of funds 
the deposits of the bank generally have shown a steady growth trend as well as a generally consistent deposit mix 
however  there can be no assurance that deposit growth will continue or that the deposit mix will not shift to higher rate products 

table of contents the bank is a member of the fhlb 
as such  we are able to participate in various fhlb borrowing programs which require certain investments in fhlb common stock as a prerequisite to obtaining funds 
as of december   hvb had short term borrowing lines with the fhlb of million with no balances outstanding 
these and various other fhlb borrowing programs available to members are subject to availability of qualifying loan and or investment securities collateral and other terms and conditions 
the bank also has unsecured overnight borrowing lines totaling million with three major financial institutions which were all unused and available at december  in addition  hvb has approved lines under retail certificate of deposit agreements with three major financial institutions totaling approximately billion which were also unused and available at december  the retail certificates of deposit lines are subject to product availability and other restrictions 
additional liquidity is also provided by the bank s ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank s discount window 
in response to the current economic crisis  the federal reserve bank has increased the ability of banks to borrow from this source through its borrower in custody bic program  which expanded the types of collateral which qualify as security for such borrowings 
the bank has been approved to participate in the bic program 
there were no amounts outstanding with the federal reserve at december  the various borrowing programs discussed above are subject to certain restrictions and terms and conditions which may include continued availability of such borrowing programs  the company s ability to pledge qualifying collateral in sufficient amounts  the company s maintenance of capital ratios acceptable to these lenders and other conditions which may be imposed on the company 
as of december   the company had qualifying loan and investment securities totaling approximately million which could be utilized under available borrowing programs thereby increasing liquidity 
the company also has outstanding  at any time  a significant number of commitments to extend credit and provide financial guarantees to third parties 
these arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments 
guarantees specify limits to the company s obligations 
because many commitments and almost all guarantees expire without being funded in whole or in part  the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows 
the company is also obligated under leases or license agreements for certain of its branches and equipment 
a summary of significant long term contractual obligations  credit commitments  and projected retirement benefits at december  is as follows in thousands payments due within year after year but within years after year but within years after years total contractual obligations time deposits fhlb borrowings operating lease and license obligations total credit commitments available lines of credit letters of credit total projected retirement benefits supplemental employee retirement plan directors retirement plan total interest not included 

table of contents fhlb borrowings are presented in the above table by contractual maturity date 
the fhlb has rights  under certain conditions  to call million of those borrowings as of various dates during and quarterly thereafter 
the company pledges certain of its assets as collateral for deposits of municipalities and other deposits allowed or required by law  fhlb and frb borrowings and repurchase agreements 
by utilizing collateralized funding sources  the company is able to access a variety of cost effective sources of funds 
the assets pledged consist of certain loans secured by real estate  us treasury and government agency securities  mortgage backed securities  certain obligations of state and political subdivisions and other securities 
management monitors its liquidity requirements by assessing assets pledged  the level of assets available for sale  additional borrowing capacity and other factors 
management does not anticipate any negative impact to its liquidity from its pledging activities 
another source of funding for the company is capital market funds  which includes common stock  preferred stock  convertible debentures  retained earnings and long term debt qualifying as regulatory capital 
each of the company s sources of liquidity is vulnerable to various uncertainties beyond the control of the company 
scheduled loan and security payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while loan and security prepayments and calls  and deposit flows vary widely in reaction to market conditions  primarily prevailing interest rates 
asset sales are influenced by general market interest rates and other unforeseen market conditions 
the company s ability to borrow to meet liquidity demands or to do so at attractive rates is affected by its financial condition and other market conditions 
management expects that the company has and will have sources of liquidity to meet any expected funding needs and also to be responsive to changing interest rate markets 
quarterly results of operations set forth below are certain quarterly results of operations for and in thousands except for per share amounts fourth third second first fourth third second first total interest income net interest income provision for loan losses income loss before income taxes net income loss basic earnings loss per common share diluted earnings loss per common share the significant increase in the provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of resulted from writedowns associated with the transfer of million of loans to the held for sale status 
the credit mark established through this transfer of loans increased the fourth quarter s provision by million 
the significant increase in income before income taxes in the first quarter of is due to a pretax gain of million resulting from the completion of the sales of the aforementioned loans

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market indices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
since all company transactions are denominated in us dollars with no direct foreign exchange or changes in commodity price exposures  the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
if more liabilities than assets reprice in a given period a liability sensitive position or negative gap  market interest rate changes will be reflected more quickly in liability rates 
if interest rates decline  such positions will generally benefit net interest income 
alternatively  where assets reprice more quickly than liabilities in a given period an asset sensitive position or positive gap  a decline in market rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income 
excessive levels of interest rate risk can result in a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  effective risk management techniques that maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels are essential to the company s safety and soundness 
the company has no financial instruments entered into for trading purposes 
federal funds  both purchases and sales  on which rates change daily  and loans and deposits tied to certain indices  such as the prime rate and federal discount rate  are the most market sensitive and have the most stable fair values 
the least sensitive instruments include long term fixed rate loans and securities and fixed rate savings deposits  which have the least stable fair value 
on those types falling between these extremes  the management of maturity distributions is as important as the balances maintained 
management of maturity distributions involve the matching of interest rate maturities  as well as principal maturities  and is a key determinant of net interest income 
in periods of rapidly changing interest rates  an imbalance gap between the rate sensitive assets and liabilities can cause major fluctuations in net interest income and in earnings 
establishing patterns of sensitivity which will enhance future growth regardless of frequent shifts in the market conditions is one of the objectives of the company s asset liability management strategy 
evaluating the company s exposure to changes in interest rates is the responsibility of alsc and includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
when assessing the interest rate risk management process  the company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at appropriate levels 
evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires the company to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and asset quality 
the company uses the simulation analysis to estimate the effect that specific movements in interest rates would have on net interest income 
this analysis incorporates management assumptions about the levels of future balance sheet trends  different patterns of interest rate movements  and changing relationships between interest rates ie basis risk 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
for a given level of market interest rate changes  the simulation can consider the impact of the varying behavior of cash flows from principal prepayments on the loan portfolio and mortgage backed securities  call activities on investment securities  balance changes on non contractual maturity deposit products demand deposits  checking with interest  money market and savings accounts  and embedded option risk by taking into account the effects of interest rate caps and floors 
the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business activities is not integrated into the simulation analysis 
the company can assess the results of the simulation and  if necessary  implement suitable strategies to adjust the structure of its assets and liabilities to reduce potential unacceptable risks to net interest income 
the simulation analysis at december  shows the company s net interest income increasing moderately if rates rise and decreasing slightly if rates fall 

table of contents the company s policy limit on interest rate risk is that if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease basis points from current rates  the percentage change in estimated net interest income for the subsequent month measurement period should not decline by more than percent 
net interest income is forecasted using various interest rate scenarios that management believes are reasonably likely to impact the company s financial condition 
a base case scenario  in which current interest rates remain stable  is used for comparison to other scenario simulations 
the table below illustrates the estimated exposures under a rising rate scenario and a declining rate scenario calculated as a percentage change in estimated net interest income from the base case scenario  assuming a gradual shift in interest rates for the next month measurement period  beginning december  and gradual change in interest rates percentage change in estimated net interest income from december  percentage change in estimated net interest income from december  basis points basis points since  a basis point downward change was substituted for the basis point downward scenario previously used  as management believes that a basis point downward change is not a meaningful analysis in light of current interest rate levels 
the percentage change in estimated net income in the and basis points scenario is within the company s policy limits 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  there are certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented 
actual results may differ significantly from simulated results should market conditions and management strategies  among other factors  vary from the assumptions used in the analysis 
the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react the same to changes in interest rates  but  in reality  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
specific types of financial instruments may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while other types of financial instruments may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  other assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
furthermore  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and securities and early withdrawals from time deposits could deviate significantly from those assumed in the simulation 
one way to minimize interest rate risk is to maintain a balanced or matched interest rate sensitivity position 
however  profits are not always maximized by matched funding 
to increase net interest earnings  the company selectively mismatches asset and liability repricing to take advantage of short term interest rate movements and the shape of the us treasury yield curve 
the magnitude of the mismatch depends on a careful assessment of the risks presented by forecasted interest rate movements 
the risk inherent in such a mismatch  or gap  is that interest rates may not move as anticipated 
interest rate risk exposure is reviewed in quarterly meetings in which guidelines are established for the following quarter and the longer term exposure 
the structural interest rate mismatch is reviewed periodically by alsc and management 
the company also prepares a static gap analysis 
balance sheet items are appropriately categorized by contractual maturity  expected average lives for mortgage backed securities  or repricing dates  with prime rate indexed loans and certificates of deposit 
checking with interest accounts  savings accounts  money market accounts and other borrowings constitute the bulk of the floating rate category 
the determination of the interest rate sensitivity of non contractual items is arrived at in a subjective fashion 
savings accounts are viewed as a relatively stable source of funds and are therefore classified as intermediate funds 

table of contents at december   the static gap showed a positive cumulative gap of million in the one day to one year repricing period  as compared to a positive cumulative gap of million at december  the change in the cumulative static gap between december  and december  reflects the results of the company s efforts to reposition its portfolios as a result of changes in interest rates and changes to the shape of the yield curve 
management believes that this strategy has enabled the company to be well positioned for the next cycle of interest rate changes and to address conditions which may arise as a result of the current financial crisis 
the company will be more asset sensitive during the period in which it is deploying the proceeds from the loan sales
