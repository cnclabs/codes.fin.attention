item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a growth oriented delaware master limited partnership mlp organized by anadarko to own  operate  acquire and develop midstream energy assets 
we currently own assets located in east  west and south texas  the rocky mountains colorado  utah and wyoming  and the mid continent kansas and oklahoma and are engaged in the business of gathering  processing  compressing  treating and transporting natural gas  condensate  ngls and crude oil for anadarko and its consolidated subsidiaries  as well as for third party producers and customers 
as of december   our assets consisted of thirteen gathering systems  seven natural gas treating facilities  ten natural gas processing facilities  two ngl pipelines  one interstate natural gas pipeline  one intrastate natural gas pipeline and interests accounted for under the equity method in two gas gathering systems and a crude oil pipeline 
see also note subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item within this form k 
significant financial highlights during the year ended december   include the following in connection with the closing of the western gas equity partners  lp wgp ipo  we sold  common units to wgp and  general partner units to our general partner 
net proceeds of million are being used for general partnership purposes and the funding of capital expenditures 
we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due net proceeds were used to repay all amounts then outstanding under our revolving credit facility rcf and the note payable to anadarko  with the remaining net proceeds used for general partnership purposes 
see liquidity and capital resources within this item for additional information 
we issued  common units to the public  generating net proceeds of million  including the general partner s proportionate capital contribution to maintain its general partner interest 
net proceeds are being used for general partnership purposes  including the funding of capital expenditures 
see equity offerings under items and of this form k for additional information 
we completed the acquisition of anadarko s mgr assets located in southwestern wyoming in january and the acquisition of anadarko s then remaining interest in chipeta in august 
see acquisitions under items and of this form k for additional information 
we announced two growth projects i the expansion of our processing capacity by mmcf d at our wattenberg system with the construction of the lancaster plant  and ii the construction of a new mmcf d cryogenic processing plant in the maverick basin  referred to as the brasada plant 
startup is anticipated in the first quarter of for the lancaster plant and the second quarter of for the brasada plant 
see liquidity and capital resources within this item for additional information 
we raised our distribution to per unit for the fourth quarter of  representing a increase over the distribution for the third quarter of  an increase over the distribution for the fourth quarter of  and our fifteenth consecutive quarterly increase 
significant operational highlights during the year ended december   include the following throughput attributable to western gas partners  lp totaled  mmcf d for the year ended december   representing a increase compared to the year ended december  gross margin total revenues less cost of product attributable to western gas partners  lp averaged per mcf for the year ended december   representing a decrease compared to the year ended december  our operations the following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of this form k 
unless the context otherwise requires  references to we  us  our  the partnership or western gas partners refers to western gas partners  lp and its subsidiaries 
the partnership s general partner  western gas holdings  llc the general partner or gp  is owned by wgp  a delaware master limited partnership formed by anadarko petroleum corporation 
western gas equity holdings  llc is wgp s general partner and is a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko petroleum corporation 
affiliates refers to wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries of anadarko  excluding the partnership  and also refers to fort union  white cliffs and rendezvous 
because anadarko controls us through its control of wgp  which owns our general partner  each of our acquisitions of assets from anadarko has been considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control 
as such  the partnership assets we acquired from anadarko were initially recorded at anadarko s historic carrying value  which did not correlate to the total acquisition price paid by us see note acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
further  after an acquisition of assets from anadarko  we may be required to recast our financial statements to include the activities of such assets as of the date of common control 
the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets from anadarko have been prepared from anadarko s historical cost basis accounts and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if we had owned the assets during the periods reported 
for ease of reference  we refer to the historical financial results of the partnership assets prior to our acquisitions from anadarko as being our historical financial results 
our results are driven primarily by the volumes of natural gas and ngls we gather  process  treat or transport through our systems 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues and of our throughput excluding equity investment revenues and throughput were attributable to transactions with anadarko 
in our gathering operations  we contract with producers and customers to gather natural gas from individual wells located near our gathering systems 
we connect wells to gathering lines through which natural gas may be compressed and delivered to a processing plant  treating facility or downstream pipeline  and ultimately to end users 
we also treat a significant portion of the natural gas that we gather so that it will satisfy required specifications for pipeline transportation 
we received significant dedications from our largest customer  anadarko  solely with respect to our wattenberg  dew  pinnacle  haley  helper  clawson and hugoton gathering systems 
specifically  pursuant to the terms of our applicable gathering agreements  anadarko has dedicated to us all of the natural gas production it owns or controls from i wells that are currently connected to such gathering systems  and ii additional wells that are drilled within one mile of wells connected to such gathering systems  as those systems currently exist and as they are expanded to connect additional wells in the future 
as a result  this dedication will continue to expand as long as additional wells are connected to these gathering systems 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross margin was attributed to fee based contracts  under which a fixed fee is received based on the volume or thermal content of the natural gas we gather  process  treat or transport 
this type of contract provides us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk  except to the extent that i we retain and sell drip condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas from the wellhead or ii actual recoveries differ from contractual recoveries under a limited number of processing agreements 
fee based gross margin includes equity income from our interests in fort union  white cliffs and rendezvous 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross margin  including gross margin attributable to condensate sales  was attributable to percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts  pursuant to which we have commodity price exposure 
a substantial majority of the commodity price risk associated with our percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts is hedged under commodity price swap agreements with anadarko 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross margin was derived from either long term  fee based contracts or from percent of proceeds or keep whole agreements that were hedged with commodity price swap agreements 
see note transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k 
we also have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low natural gas prices have caused and may continue to cause our current or potential customers to delay drilling or shut in production in certain areas  which would reduce the volumes of natural gas available for our systems 
we also bear a limited degree of commodity price risk through settlement of natural gas imbalances 
please read item a of this form k 
as a result of our ipo and subsequent acquisitions from anadarko and third parties  the results of operations  financial position and cash flows may vary significantly for  and as compared to future periods 
please see the caption items affecting the comparability of our financial results  set forth below in this item how we evaluate our operations our management relies on certain financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance 
these metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include throughput  gross margin  operating and maintenance expenses  general and administrative expenses  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 
throughput 
throughput is an essential operating variable we use in assessing our ability to generate revenues 
in order to maintain or increase throughput on our gathering and processing systems  we must connect additional wells to our systems 
our success in maintaining or increasing throughput is impacted by successful drilling of new wells by producers that are dedicated to our systems  recompletions of existing wells connected to our systems  our ability to secure volumes from new wells drilled on non dedicated acreage and our ability to attract natural gas volumes currently gathered  processed or treated by our competitors 
during the year ended december   we added receipt points to our systems with initial throughput of approximately mmcf d per receipt point 
gross margin 
we define gross margin as total revenues less cost of product 
we consider gross margin to provide information useful in assessing our results of operations and our ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt 
cost of product expenses include i costs associated with the purchase of natural gas and ngls pursuant to our percent of proceeds and keep whole processing contracts  ii costs associated with the valuation of our gas imbalances  iii costs associated with our obligations under certain contracts to redeliver a volume of natural gas to shippers  which is thermally equivalent to condensate retained by us and sold to third parties  and iv costs associated with our fuel tracking mechanism  which tracks the difference between actual fuel usage and loss  and amounts recovered for estimated fuel usage and loss pursuant to our contracts 
these expenses are subject to variability  although our exposure to commodity price risk attributable to purchases and sales of natural gas  condensate and ngls is mitigated through our commodity price swap agreements with anadarko 
operating and maintenance expenses 
we monitor operating and maintenance expenses to assess the impact of such costs on the profitability of our assets and to evaluate the overall efficiency of our operations 
operation and maintenance expenses include  among other things  field labor  insurance  repair and maintenance  equipment rentals  contract services  utility costs and services provided to us or on our behalf 
for periods commencing on and subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  certain of these expenses are incurred under and governed by our services and secondment agreement with anadarko 
general and administrative expenses 
to help ensure the appropriateness of our general and administrative expenses and maximize our cash available for distribution  we monitor such expenses through comparison to prior periods  to the annual budget approved by our general partner s board of directors  as well as to general and administrative expenses incurred by similar midstream companies 
general and administrative expenses for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets include amounts attributable to costs incurred on our behalf and allocations of general and administrative costs by anadarko and the general partner to us 
for periods subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  anadarko is no longer compensated for corporate services through a management services fee 
instead  allocations and reimbursements of general and administrative expenses are determined by anadarko in its reasonable discretion  in accordance with our partnership agreement and omnibus agreement 
amounts required to be reimbursed to anadarko under the omnibus agreement also include those expenses attributable to our status as a publicly traded partnership  such as the following expenses associated with annual and quarterly reporting  tax return and schedule k preparation and distribution expenses  expenses associated with listing on the new york stock exchange  and independent auditor fees  legal expenses  investor relations expenses  director fees  and registrar and transfer agent fees 
see further detail under items affecting the comparability of our financial results general and administrative expenses under the omnibus agreement below and note transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss attributable to western gas partners  lp  plus distributions from equity investees  non cash equity based compensation expense  expense in excess of the expense reimbursement cap provided in our omnibus agreement which cap is no longer effective  interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation  amortization and impairments  and other expense  less income from equity investments  interest income  income tax benefit  and other income 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make distributions 
adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements  such as industry analysts  investors  commercial banks and rating agencies  use to assess the following  among other measures our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry  without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash flow to make distributions  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities 
distributable cash flow 
we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda  plus interest income  less net cash paid for interest expense including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs originally paid in cash offset by non cash capitalized interest  maintenance capital expenditures  and income taxes 
we compare distributable cash flow to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this measure  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
we believe distributable cash flow is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many companies  analysts and others in the industry as a performance measurement tool to evaluate our operating and financial performance and compare it with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships 
distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
furthermore  while distributable cash flow is a measure we use to assess our ability to make distributions to our unitholders  it should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that we have available for distributions or that we plan to distribute for a given period 
reconciliation to gaap measures 
adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are not defined in gaap 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income attributable to western gas partners  lp and net cash provided by operating activities  and the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income attributable to western gas partners  lp 
our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to the gaap measures of net income attributable to western gas partners  lp or net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
our definitions of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry  thereby diminishing their utility 
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow compared to as applicable net income and net cash provided by operating activities  and incorporating this knowledge into its decision making processes 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results

reflects distributions of per unit declared for the year ended december  items affecting the comparability of our financial results our historical results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented may not be comparable to future or historic results of operations or cash flows for the reasons described below affiliate contracts 
the gathering agreements of our initial assets allow for rate resets that target an return on invested capital in those assets over the life of the agreement 
effective july   contracts covering all of wattenberg s affiliate throughput were converted from primarily keep whole contracts into a year fee based agreement 
this contract change impacts the comparability of the consolidated statements of income and cash flows 
in addition  in connection with the mgr acquisition  we entered into year  fee based gathering and processing agreements with anadarko effective december   for all affiliate throughput on the mgr assets 
see note transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
commodity price swap agreements 
we have commodity price swap agreements with anadarko to mitigate exposure to commodity price volatility that would otherwise be present as a result of the purchase and sale of natural gas  condensate or ngls 
notional volumes for each of the commodity price swap agreements are not specifically defined  instead  the commodity price swap agreements apply to the actual volume of our natural gas  condensate and ngls purchased and sold at the granger  hilight  hugoton  newcastle  mgr and wattenberg assets  with various expiration dates through december in december  we extended the commodity price swap agreements for the hilight and newcastle assets through december see note transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
income taxes 
income earned by the partnership  a non taxable entity for us federal income tax purposes  including and subsequent to the date of the acquisition of the partnership assets  is subject only to texas margin tax 
with respect to assets acquired from anadarko  we record anadarko s historic current and deferred income taxes for the periods prior to our ownership of the assets 
for periods subsequent to our acquisitions from anadarko  we are not subject to tax except for the texas margin tax and accordingly  do not record current and deferred federal income taxes related to such assets 
general and administrative expenses 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement  anadarko and the general partner perform centralized corporate functions for us 
prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets from anadarko  our historical consolidated financial statements reflect a management services fee representing the general and administrative expenses attributable to the partnership assets 
during the years ended december   and  we reimbursed anadarko million  million and million  respectively  in general and administrative expenses 
prior to december   the general and administrative expenses for which we reimbursed anadarko were subject to a cap as set forth in the omnibus agreement 
in addition  our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   included million of expenses incurred by anadarko and the general partner in excess of the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
such expenses were recorded as capital contributions from anadarko and did not impact the partnership s cash flows 
the amounts reimbursed under the omnibus agreement are greater than amounts allocated to us by anadarko for the aggregate management services fees reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets from anadarko 
our public company expenses  such as external audit and consulting fees  that were reimbursed to anadarko were million  million and million  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we record the equity based compensation allocated to us by anadarko as an adjustment to partners capital in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which it is contributed 
during the fourth quarter of  we were allocated million of general and administrative expenses from anadarko associated with the incentive plan 
see note transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for further information 
interest on intercompany balances 
for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets from anadarko  except for chipeta  we incurred interest expense or earned interest income on current intercompany balances with anadarko related to such assets 
these intercompany balances were extinguished through non cash transactions in connection with the closing of our ipo  the powder river acquisition  the chipeta acquisition  the granger acquisition  the wattenberg acquisition  the acquisition of a interest in white cliffs  the bison acquisition and the mgr acquisition 
therefore  interest expense and interest income attributable to these balances are reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements for the periods ending prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets  except for chipeta 
chipeta cash settles its transactions directly with third parties and anadarko  as well as with the other subsidiaries of the partnership 
beginning december   anadarko discontinued charging interest on intercompany balances 
the outstanding affiliate balances on the aforementioned assets prior to their acquisition were entirely settled through an adjustment to net investment by anadarko 
platte valley acquisition 
in february  we acquired a natural gas gathering system and cryogenic gas processing facilities  collectively referred to as the platte valley assets  financed with borrowings under our rcf 
these assets  acquired from a third party  have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date under the acquisition method of accounting 
results of operations attributable to the platte valley assets have been included in our consolidated statements of income beginning on the acquisition date in the first quarter of the fair values of the plant and processing facilities  related equipment  and intangible assets acquired were based on the market  cost and income approaches 
the liabilities assumed include certain amounts associated with environmental contingencies estimated by management 
all fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent level inputs 
see note summary of significant accounting policies  note acquisitions and note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for further information 
noncontrolling interests 
prior to august   the membership interest in chipeta held by anadarko and the membership interest in chipeta held by a third party were reflected as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and on august   we acquired anadarko s then remaining membership interest in chipeta  receiving distributions related to this additional interest beginning july  since we acquired an additional interest in an already consolidated entity  the acquisition of anadarko s then remaining membership interest was accounted for on a prospective basis 
as such  effective august   our noncontrolling interest excludes the financial results and operations of the additional chipeta interest 
the remaining membership interest held by a third party member is reflected as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for further information 
general trends and outlook we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends 
our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about  or interpretations of  available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from expected results 
impact of natural gas and ngl prices 
the relatively low natural gas price environment  which has persisted over the past three years  has led to lower levels of drilling activity in areas served by certain of our assets 
several of our customers  including anadarko  have reduced activity levels in certain areas  shifting capital toward liquid rich opportunities that offer higher margins and superior economics to producers 
this trend has resulted in fewer new well connections and  in some cases  temporary curtailments of production in those areas 
to the extent opportunities are available  we will continue to connect new wells to our systems to mitigate the impact of natural production declines in order to maintain throughput on our systems 
however  our success in connecting new wells to our systems is dependent on the activities of natural gas producers and shippers 
changes in regulations 
our operations and the operations of our customers have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and are subject to an increasing number of complex federal  state  tribal  local and other laws and regulations such as production restrictions  permitting delays  limitations on hydraulic fracturing and environmental protection regulations 
we and or our customers must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state  tribal and local governmental authorities 
for example  regulation of hydraulic fracturing is currently primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements 
if proposed federal legislation is adopted  it could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting 
any changes in statutory regulations or delays in the issuance of required permits may impact both the throughput on and profitability of our systems 
access to capital markets 
we require periodic access to capital in order to fund acquisitions and expansion projects 
under the terms of our partnership agreement  we are required to distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders  which makes us dependent upon raising capital to fund growth projects 
historically  mlps have accessed the debt and equity capital markets to raise money for new growth projects and acquisitions 
recent market turbulence has from time to time either raised the cost of capital markets financing or  in some cases  temporarily made such financing unavailable 
if we are unable either to access the capital markets or find alternative sources of capital  our growth strategy may be more challenging to execute 
impact of inflation 
although inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years  the us economy could experience a significant inflationary effect from  among other things  the governmental stimulus plans enacted since to the extent permitted by regulations and escalation provisions in certain of our existing agreements  we have the ability to recover a portion of increased costs in the form of higher fees 
impact of interest rates 
interest rates were at or near historic lows at certain times during should interest rates rise  our financing costs would increase accordingly 
additionally  as with other yield oriented securities  our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and an associated implied distribution yield 
therefore  changes in interest rates  either positive or negative  may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units  and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity  or increase the cost of issuing equity  to make acquisitions  reduce debt or for other purposes 
however  we expect our cost of capital to remain competitive  as our competitors would face similar circumstances 
acquisition opportunities 
as of december   anadarko s total domestic midstream asset portfolio  excluding the assets we own  consisted of gathering systems  approximately  miles of pipeline and processing and or treating facilities 
a key component of our growth strategy is to acquire midstream assets from anadarko and third parties over time 
as of december   wgp and affiliates held a limited partner interest in us  and through its ownership of our general partner  indirectly held a general partner interest in us and of our incentive distribution rights idrs 
given anadarko s significant interests in us  we believe anadarko will continue to be motivated to promote and support the successful execution of our business plan and to pursue projects that help to enhance the value of our business 
however  anadarko continually evaluates acquisitions and divestitures and may elect to acquire  construct or dispose of midstream assets in the future without offering us the opportunity to acquire or construct those assets 
should anadarko choose to pursue additional midstream asset sales  it is under no contractual obligation to offer assets or business opportunities to us 
we may also pursue certain asset acquisitions from third parties to the extent such acquisitions complement our or anadarko s existing asset base or allow us to capture operational efficiencies from anadarko s or third party production 
however  if we do not make additional acquisitions from anadarko or third parties on economically acceptable terms  our future growth will be limited  and the acquisitions we make could reduce  rather than increase  our cash flows generated from operations on a per unit basis

includes affiliate  third party and equity investment volumes 
gathering  treating and transportation throughput decreased by mmcf d for the year ended december   due to throughput decreases at the haley  pinnacle  hugoton and dew systems resulting from natural production declines in those areas  throughput decreases at migc due to the september expiration of a firm transportation agreement  and throughput decreases at the bison facility resulting from reduced drilling activity in the area driven by unfavorable producer economics 
these decreases were partially offset by a throughput increase at wattenberg due to increased drilling behind the system 
gathering  treating and transportation throughput increased by mmcf d for the year ended december   primarily due to the startup of the bison assets in june  and throughput increases at the wattenberg system due to increased drilling activity in the area 
these increases were partially offset by lower throughput at the migc system resulting from the january expiration of certain contracts that were not renewed due to the startup of the third party owned bison pipeline  and throughput decreases at the haley  pinnacle  dew and hugoton systems resulting from natural production declines in those areas 
processing throughput increased by mmcf d for the year ended december   primarily due to volumes processed at a plant included in the mgr acquisition under a new contract effective january  with no volumes in the comparable period  and throughput increases at the chipeta system resulting from increased drilling activity 
processing throughput increased by mmcf d for the year ended december   primarily due to the additional throughput from the platte valley system acquired in february  as well as throughput increases at the chipeta and hilight systems  resulting from drilling activity in these areas driven by the relatively high liquid content of the gas volumes produced 
these increases were partially offset by lower throughput at the red desert complex resulting from volumes being diverted away upon the resumption of a competing plant in that experienced an outage in equity investment volumes increased by mmcf d for the year ended december   resulting from higher throughput at the fort union system due to producers choosing to route additional gas to reach desired end markets and at the rendezvous system due to increased third party drilling activity

liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are for acquisitions and other capital expenditures  debt service  customary operating expenses  quarterly distributions to our limited partners and general partner  and distributions to our noncontrolling interest owner 
our sources of liquidity as of december   included cash and cash equivalents  cash flows generated from operations  including interest income on our million note receivable from anadarko  available borrowing capacity under our rcf  and issuances of additional equity or debt securities 
we believe that cash flows generated from these sources will be sufficient to satisfy our short term working capital requirements and long term maintenance and expansion capital expenditure requirements 
the amount of future distributions to unitholders will depend on our results of operations  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors of our general partner on a quarterly basis 
due to our cash distribution policy  we expect to rely on external financing sources  including equity and debt issuances  to fund expansion capital expenditures  and fund future acquisitions 
however  to limit interest expense  we may use operating cash flows to fund expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions  which could result in subsequent borrowings under our rcf to pay distributions or fund other short term working capital requirements 
our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash as defined in the partnership agreement to unitholders of record on the applicable record date within days of the end of each quarter 
we have made cash distributions to our unitholders each quarter since our ipo and have increased our quarterly distribution each quarter since the second quarter of on january   the board of directors of our general partner declared a cash distribution to our unitholders of per unit  or million in aggregate  including incentive distributions 
the cash distribution was paid on february   to unitholders of record at the close of business on february  management continuously monitors our leverage position and coordinates its capital expenditure program  quarterly distributions and acquisition strategy with its expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedule 
we will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including additional borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities  to secure funds as needed or to refinance outstanding debt balances with longer term notes 
to facilitate a potential debt or equity securities issuance  we have the ability to sell securities under our shelf registration statements 
our ability to generate cash flows is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
please read item a risk factors of this form k 
working capital 
as of december   we had million of working capital  which we define as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
working capital is an indication of our liquidity and potential need for short term funding 
our working capital requirements are driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable and factors such as credit extended to  and the timing of collections from  our customers  and the level and timing of our spending for maintenance and expansion activity 
capital expenditures 
our business is capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and improve existing facilities or develop new midstream infrastructure 
we categorize capital expenditures as either of the following maintenance capital expenditures  which include those expenditures required to maintain the existing operating capacity and service capability of our assets  such as to replace system components and equipment that have been subject to significant use over time  become obsolete or reached the end of their useful lives  to remain in compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or to complete additional well connections to maintain existing system throughput and related cash flows  or expansion capital expenditures  which include expenditures to construct new midstream infrastructure and those expenditures incurred in order to extend the useful lives of our assets  reduce costs  increase revenues or increase system throughput or capacity from current levels  including well connections that increase existing system throughput

expected capital projects include the continued construction of new cryogenic processing plants in northeast colorado and south texas 
our future expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly from period to period based on the investment opportunities available to us  which are dependent  in part  on the drilling activities of anadarko and third party producers 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash flows generated from our operations  interest income from our note receivable from anadarko  borrowings under our rcf  the issuance of additional partnership units or debt offerings

proceeds from the offering of the notes net of the underwriting discount of million and debt issuance costs were used to repay the then outstanding balance on the partnership s rcf  with the remainder used for general partnership purposes 
upon issuance  the notes were fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our wholly owned subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors 
the subsidiary guarantors guarantees were immediately released on june   upon the subsidiary guarantors becoming released from their obligations under our rcf  as discussed below 
the notes mature on june   unless redeemed at a redemption price that includes a make whole premium 
we may redeem the notes in whole or in part  at any time before march   at a redemption price equal to the greater of i of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or ii the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such notes exclusive of interest accrued to the redemption date discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the notes plus basis points  plus  in either case  accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on the principal amount being redeemed to such redemption date 
on or after march   the notes may be redeemed  at any time in whole  or from time to time in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued interest on the notes to be redeemed to the date of redemption 
the indentures governing the notes and the notes contain customary events of default including  among others  i default for days in the payment of interest when due  ii default in payment  when due  of principal of or premium  if any  at maturity  upon redemption or otherwise  and iii certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency 
the indentures also contain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability  as well as that of certain of our subsidiaries  to i create liens on our principal properties  ii engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and iii merge or consolidate with another entity or sell  lease or transfer substantially all of our properties or assets to another entity 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the indentures 
note payable to anadarko 
in december  we entered into a five year million term loan agreement with anadarko 
the interest rate was fixed at until november the term loan agreement was amended in december to fix the interest rate at through maturity in in june  the note payable to anadarko was repaid in full with proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
revolving credit facility 
in march  we entered into an amended and restated million senior unsecured rcf and borrowed million under the rcf to repay the wattenberg term loan described below 
the rcf amended and restated a million credit facility  which was originally entered into in october the rcf matures in march and bears interest at london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins currently ranging from to  or an alternate base rate equal to the greatest of a the prime rate  b the federal funds effective rate plus  or c libor plus  in each case plus applicable margins currently ranging from to 
the interest rate was and at december  and  respectively 
we are also required to pay a quarterly facility fee currently ranging from to of the commitment amount whether used or unused  based upon our senior unsecured debt rating 
the facility fee rate was at december  and on june   following the receipt of a second investment grade rating as defined in the rcf  the guarantees provided by our wholly owned subsidiaries were released  and we are no longer subject to certain of the restrictive covenants associated with the rcf  including the maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and adherence to covenants that limit  among other things  our ability  and that of certain of our subsidiaries  to dispose of assets and make certain investments or payments 
the rcf continues to contain certain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability  and that of certain of our subsidiaries  to incur additional indebtedness  grant certain liens  merge  consolidate or allow any material change in the character of our business  enter into certain affiliate transactions and use proceeds other than for partnership purposes 
the rcf also contains various customary covenants  customary events of default and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter which is defined as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization consolidated ebitda for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on such day of to  or a consolidated leverage ratio of to with respect to quarters ending in the day period immediately following certain acquisitions 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit issued under our million rcf 
at december   we were in compliance with all remaining covenants under the rcf 
the notes  the notes and obligations under the rcf are recourse to our general partner 
in turn  our general partner has been indemnified by a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko against any claims made against the general partner under the notes  the notes and or the rcf 
wattenberg term loan 
in connection with the wattenberg acquisition  in august we borrowed million under a three year term loan from a group of banks wattenberg term loan 
the wattenberg term loan incurred interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the wattenberg term loan agreement 
we repaid the wattenberg term loan in march using borrowings from our rcf and recognized million of accelerated amortization expense related to its early repayment 
registered securities 
we may issue an indeterminate amount of common units and various debt securities under our effective shelf registration statements on file with the us securities and exchange commission 
in august  we filed a registration statement with the sec authorizing the issuance of up to million of our common units in amounts  at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of our offerings 
as of december   we had not issued any common units under this registration statement 
credit risk 
we bear credit risk represented by our exposure to non payment or non performance by our counterparties  including anadarko  financial institutions  customers and other parties 
generally  non payment or non performance results from a customer s inability to satisfy payables to us for services rendered or volumes owed pursuant to gas imbalance agreements 
we examine and monitor the creditworthiness of third party customers and may establish credit limits for third party customers 
a substantial portion of our throughput  however  comes from producers that have investment grade ratings 
we are dependent upon a single producer  anadarko  for the substantial majority of our natural gas volumes  and we do not maintain a credit limit with respect to anadarko 
consequently  we are subject to the risk of non payment or late payment by anadarko for gathering  processing and transportation fees and for proceeds from the sale of residue  ngls and condensate to anadarko 
we expect our exposure to concentrated risk of non payment or non performance to continue for as long as we remain substantially dependent on anadarko for our revenues 
additionally  we are exposed to credit risk on the note receivable from anadarko  which was issued concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering 
we are also party to agreements with anadarko under which anadarko is required to indemnify us for certain environmental claims  losses arising from rights of way claims  failures to obtain required consents or governmental permits and income taxes with respect to the assets acquired from anadarko 
finally  we have entered into various commodity price swap agreements with anadarko in order to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk and are subject to performance risk thereunder 
our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be adversely impacted if anadarko becomes unable to perform under the terms of our gathering  processing and transportation agreements  natural gas and ngl purchase agreements  anadarko s note payable to us  our omnibus agreement  the services and secondment agreement  contribution agreements or the commodity price swap agreements 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  the table below excludes amounts classified as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  other than the current portions of the categories listed within the table 
it is expected that the majority of the excluded current liabilities will be paid in cash in obligations by period thousands thereafter total long term debt principal interest asset retirement obligations capital expenditures credit facility fees environmental obligations operating leases total debt and credit facility fees

asset retirement obligations 
when assets are acquired or constructed  the initial estimated asset retirement obligation is recognized in an amount equal to the net present value of the settlement obligation  with an associated increase in properties and equipment 
revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from revisions to estimated inflation rates and discount rates  changes in retirement costs and the estimated timing of settlement 
for additional information see note asset retirement obligations in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
capital expenditures 
included in this amount are capital obligations related to our expansion projects 
we have other planned capital and investment projects that are discretionary in nature  with no substantial contractual obligations made in advance of the actual expenditures 
see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
environmental obligations 
we are subject to various environmental remediation obligations arising from federal  state and local regulations regarding air and water quality  hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters 
we regularly monitor the remediation and reclamation process and the liabilities recorded and believe that the amounts reflected in our recorded environmental obligations are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations 
for additional information on environmental obligations  see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
operating leases 
anadarko  on our behalf  has entered into lease agreements for corporate offices  shared field offices and a warehouse supporting our operations  for which it charges us rent 
the amounts above represent existing contractual operating lease obligations that may be assigned or otherwise charged to us pursuant to the reimbursement provisions of the omnibus agreement

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods reported 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to the determination of properties and equipment  asset retirement obligations  litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes and fair values 
although these estimates are based on management s best available knowledge of current and expected future events  changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates  and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these estimates with the audit committee of our general partner 
for additional information concerning our accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
depreciation 
depreciation expense is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
determination of depreciation expense requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage values of property  plant and equipment 
as circumstances warrant  depreciation estimates are reviewed to determine if any changes in the underlying assumptions are necessary 
the weighted average life of our long lived assets is approximately years 
if the depreciable lives of our assets were reduced by  we estimate that annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our operating income 
impairments of tangible assets 
property  plant and equipment are generally stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value  if impaired 
because acquisitions of assets from anadarko are transfers of net assets between entities under common control  the partnership assets acquired by us from anadarko are initially recorded at anadarko s historic carrying value 
assets acquired in a business combination or non monetary exchange with a third party are initially recorded at fair value 
property  plant and equipment balances are evaluated for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable from expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is not expected to be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment may be recognized 
any impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value 
in assessing long lived assets for impairments  our management evaluates changes in our business and economic conditions and their implications for recoverability of the assets carrying amounts 
since a significant portion of our revenues arises from gathering  processing and transporting the natural gas production from anadarko operated properties  significant downward revisions in reserve estimates or changes in future development plans by anadarko  to the extent they affect our operations  may necessitate assessment of the carrying amount of our affected assets for recoverability 
such assessment requires application of judgment regarding the use and ultimate disposition of the asset  long range revenue and expense estimates  global and regional economic conditions  including commodity prices and drilling activity by our customers  as well as other factors affecting estimated future net cash flows 
the measure of impairments to be recognized  if any  depends upon management s estimate of the asset s fair value  which may be determined based on the estimates of future net cash flows or values at which similar assets were transferred in the market in recent transactions  if such data is available 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million impairment related to a gathering system in central wyoming that was impaired to its estimated fair value using level fair value inputs 
also in the fourth quarter of  an impairment of million was recognized for the original installation costs on a compressor relocated within our operating assets 
during the year ended december   we recognized a million impairment related to certain equipment and materials 
the costs of the equipment and materials  previously capitalized as assets under construction and related to a red desert complex expansion project  were deemed no longer recoverable as the expansion project was indefinitely postponed by anadarko management 
subsequent to the project evaluation and impairment  the remaining fair value of the equipment and materials was reclassified from within property  plant and equipment to other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and was approximately million as of december  also during  following an evaluation of future cash flows  an impairment of million was recognized for a transportation pipeline that was impaired to its estimated fair value using level fair value inputs 
during the year ended december   we recognized a million impairment related to a compressor sold during the year to a third party  and a million impairment due to cancelled capital projects and additional costs recorded on a project previously impaired to salvage value 
impairments of goodwill 
goodwill represents the allocated portion of anadarko s midstream goodwill attributed to the assets we have acquired from anadarko 
the carrying value of anadarko s midstream goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by anadarko 
accordingly  our goodwill balance does not reflect  and in some cases is significantly higher than  the difference between the consideration paid by us for acquisitions from anadarko compared to the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired annually as of october  unless facts and circumstances make it necessary to test more frequently 
accounting standards require that goodwill be assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level 
management has determined that we have one operating segment and two reporting units i gathering and processing and transportation 
the carrying value of goodwill as of december   was million for the gathering and processing reporting unit and million for the transportation reporting unit 
the first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is an optional qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that the fair value of the reporting unit more than likely exceeds the related carrying amount  then goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not necessary 
if the qualitative assessment is not performed or indicates the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount  we would compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets  including goodwill  and determine whether an impairment is necessary 
in this manner  estimating the fair value of our reporting units was not necessary based on the evaluation as of october  however  fair value estimates of our reporting units may be required for goodwill impairment testing in the future  and if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is written down to the implied fair value through a charge to operating expense based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test  when necessary 
management uses information available to make these fair value estimates  including market multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
specifically  our management estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected ebitda 
management considered observable transactions in the market  as well as trading multiples for peers  to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against our projected ebitda 
a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in a goodwill impairment 
factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines  throughput declines  cost increases  regulatory or political environment changes  and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market based transactions for similar assets 
based on our most recent goodwill impairment test  we concluded  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 
therefore  no goodwill impairment was indicated  and no goodwill impairment has been recognized in these consolidated financial statements 
impairments of intangible assets 
our intangible asset balance as of december  and  represents the fair value  net of amortization  of the contracts we assumed in connection with the platte valley acquisition in february these long term contracts  which dedicate certain customers field production to the acquired gathering and processing system  provide an extended commercial relationship with the existing customers whereby we will have the opportunity to gather and process future production from the customers acreage 
customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over years  which is the estimated productive life of the reserves covered by the underlying acreage ultimately expected to be produced and gathered or processed through the partnership s assets subject to current contractual arrangements 
in november  chipeta entered into interconnect agreements with a third party  whereby the third party will construct  own and operate an inlet interconnect to the chipeta plant and a redelivery interconnect from the chipeta plant 
chipeta will pay the third party million and will be granted access rights to the third party infrastructure  thereby providing us the ability to enter into processing agreements with additional third party producers 
our intangible asset balance as of december   includes this payment  which will be amortized on a straight line basis over the year life of the agreements 
management assesses intangible assets for impairment  together with the related underlying long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the respective asset may not be recoverable 
impairments exist when an asset s carrying amount exceeds estimates of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the tested asset 
when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount are under consideration  estimates of future undiscounted cash flows take into account possible outcomes and probabilities of their occurrence 
if the carrying amount of the tested asset is not recoverable based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its estimated fair value such that the asset s carrying amount is adjusted to its estimated fair value with an offsetting charge to operating expense 
no intangible asset impairment has been recognized in connection with these assets 
fair value 
management estimates fair value in performing impairment tests for long lived assets and goodwill as well as for the initial measurement of asset retirement obligations and the initial recognition of environmental obligations assumed in third party acquisitions 
when our management is required to measure fair value and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability  management utilizes the cost  income  or market multiples valuation approach depending on the quality of information available to support management s assumptions 
the income approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows  and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate 
such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment  since the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices  estimates of future throughput  capital and operating costs and the timing thereof  economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
a multiple approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected ebitda and multiple of that ebitda that a buyer would pay to acquire an asset 
management s estimates of future net cash flows and ebitda are inherently imprecise because they reflect management s expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect a market participant s view of long term prices  costs and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in our business plans and investment decisions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases 
the information pertaining to operating leases required for this item is provided under note commitments and contingencies included in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
recent accounting developments none 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
certain of our processing services are provided under percent of proceeds and keep whole agreements in which anadarko is typically responsible for the marketing of the natural gas and ngls 
under percent of proceeds agreements  we receive a specified percentage of the net proceeds from the sale of natural gas and ngls 
under keep whole agreements  we keep of the ngls produced  and the processed natural gas  or value of the gas  is returned to the producer 
since some of the gas is used and removed during processing  we compensate the producer for this amount of gas by supplying additional gas or by paying an agreed upon value for the gas utilized 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in commodity prices as a result of the purchase and sale of natural gas  condensate or ngls  we currently have in place commodity price swap agreements with anadarko expiring at various times through december for additional information on the commodity price swap agreements  see note transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
in addition  pursuant to certain of our contracts  we retain and sell drip condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas 
as part of this arrangement  we are required to provide a thermally equivalent volume of natural gas or the cash equivalent thereof to the shipper 
thus  our revenues for this portion of our contractual arrangement are based on the price received for the drip condensate  and our costs for this portion of our contractual arrangement depend on the price of natural gas 
historically  drip condensate sells at a price representing a discount to the price of new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  west texas intermediate crude oil 
we consider our exposure to commodity price risk associated with the above described arrangements to be minimal given the existence of the commodity price swap agreements with anadarko and the relatively small amount of our operating income that is impacted by changes in market prices 
accordingly  we do not expect a increase or decrease in natural gas or ngl prices would have had a material impact on our operating income  financial condition or cash flows during the year ended december   excluding the effect of natural gas imbalances described below 
we also bear a limited degree of commodity price risk with respect to settlement of our natural gas imbalances that arise from differences in gas volumes received into our systems and gas volumes delivered by us to customers  as well as instances where our actual liquids recovery or fuel usage varies from the contractually stipulated amounts 
natural gas volumes owed to or by us that are subject to monthly cash settlement are valued according to the terms of the contract as of the balance sheet dates  and generally reflect market index prices 
other natural gas volumes owed to or by us are valued at our weighted average cost of natural gas as of the balance sheet dates and are settled in kind 
our exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices on outstanding imbalances depends on the timing of settlement of the imbalances 
interest rate risk 
interest rates during and were low compared to historic rates 
as of december   we had no variable rate borrowings outstanding under our rcf which bears interest at a rate based on libor or otherwise 
if interest rates rise  our future financing costs could increase if we incur borrowings under our rcf 
for the year ended december   a change in libor would have resulted in a nominal change in net income 
we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future  either under our rcf or other financing sources  including commercial bank borrowings or debt issuances
