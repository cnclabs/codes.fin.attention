item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december   and free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  as shown on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations  make investments  fund acquisitions and for certain other activities 
free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income  net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets  we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash flows from operating activities 
during the years ended december   and  free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities and in purchases of property and equipment as shown in the net cash flows from operating activities and net cash flows from investing sections  respectively  of our consolidated statements of cash flows included herein 
operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods  since these changes depend upon  among other things  management s timing of payments and control of inventory levels  and cash receipts 
in addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities  free cash flow can vary significantly from period to period depending upon  among other things  subscriber growth  subscriber revenue  subscriber churn  subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs  operating efficiencies  increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment  and other factors 
the following table reconciles free cash flow to net cash flows from operating activities 
for the years ended december  in thousands free cash flow add back purchases of property and equipment net cash flows from operating activities the decrease in free cash flow from to of million resulted from a decease in net cash flows from operating activities of million and an increase in purchases of property and equipment of million 
the decrease in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a billion decrease of net income adjusted to exclude non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense  realized and unrealized losses gains on investments  and deferred tax expense benefit  which includes the negative impact of million of payments for the voom settlement agreement 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities is principally attributable to the unfavorable impact in of the settlement of the tivo litigation and timing differences between book expense and tax payments 
the increase in purchases of property and equipment in was primarily attributable to an increase in satellite construction and other corporate capital expenditures 
the increase in free cash flow from to of million resulted from an increase in net cash flows from operating activities of million and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of million 
the increase in net cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash resulting from net income  adjusted to exclude non cash changes in deferred tax expense benefit  and depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a million decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities is principally attributable to timing differences between book expense and cash payments and million in payments for the tivo and retailer class action settlements 
the decrease in purchases of property and equipment in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued was primarily attributable to a decrease in satellite construction and a decline in expenditures for equipment under our lease programs for new and existing subscribers of million 
on december   the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of was enacted  which provides for a bonus depreciation deduction of of the cost of our qualified capital expenditures from september  through december  during the year ended december   our deferred income tax expense benefit recorded as a non cash adjustment to net income on our consolidated statements of cash flows increased million compared to the same period in this change is primarily associated with equipment related temporary differences as a result of bonus depreciation deductions available in cash flows from operating activities 
we typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash flows from operating activities of billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
see discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in free cash flow above 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  acquisitions  strategic investments and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  capital expenditures for new and existing pay tv customer equipment totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   capital expenditures for new and existing broadband customer equipment totaled million  of which million was for new broadband customer equipment 
during the years ended december  and  capital expenditures for broadband customer equipment were immaterial 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of million primarily related to net purchases of marketable investment securities of billion and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of strategic investments of billion 
the increase in capital expenditures included million for satellites  million associated with our pay tv and broadband subscriber acquisition and retention lease programs and million of other corporate capital expenditures 
the decrease in net purchases of strategic investments primarily resulted from our investments in dbsd north america of billion and in terrestar of billion 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of billion primarily resulted from our investment in dbsd north america of billion  the terrestar transaction of billion  the blockbuster acquisition of million  net of million cash received  and the sprint settlement agreement net payment of million which were partially offset by a net increase in sales of marketable investment securities of billion and a decline in capital expenditures of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt  cash used for the repurchase  redemption or payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations  dividends paid on our class a and class b common stock and repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the years ended december  and  we reported net cash inflows from financing activities of billion and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of million 
the net cash inflows in primarily related to the net proceeds of billion related to the issuance of our senior notes due  our senior notes due and our senior notes due  partially offset by the million dividend paid in cash on our class a and class b common stock 
the net cash inflows in primarily related to the proceeds of billion from the issuance of our senior notes due  net of deferred financing costs  partially offset by the redemption and repurchases of our senior notes due of billion and our dividend payment of million 
the net cash outflows in primarily related to the repurchases of our class a common stock 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other liquidity items subscriber base dish added approximately  net pay tv subscribers during the year ended december   compared to a loss of approximately  net pay tv subscribers during the same period in the increase versus the same period in primarily resulted from a decrease in our average monthly pay tv subscriber churn rate and higher gross new pay tv subscriber activations due primarily to increased advertising associated with our hopper set top box 
see results of operations above for further discussion 
there are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at any given point in time  including our pay tv churn rate and how successful we are at retaining our current pay tv subscribers 
as we lose pay tv subscribers from our existing base  the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced 
satellites operation of our pay tv service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer 
moreover  current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming 
while we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity 
security systems increases in theft of our signal or our competitors signals could  in addition to reducing new subscriber activations  also cause subscriber churn to increase 
we use security access devices in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content 
our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures  such as security access device replacement programs and updates in security software  that are intended to make signal theft more difficult 
it has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft 
during  we completed the replacement of our security access devices and re secured our system 
we expect additional future replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system s security is compromised 
stock repurchases our board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our class a common stock 
on november   our board of directors extended this authorization such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to billion of outstanding shares of our class a common stock through and including december  as of december   we may repurchase up to billion under this plan 
during the years ended december  and  there were no repurchases of our class a common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock for million in the aggregate 
subscriber acquisition and retention costs we incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers  including advertising  retailer incentives  equipment subsidies  installation services  and new customer promotions 
while we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription  there can be no assurance that we will 
we employ business rules such as minimum credit requirements and we strive to provide outstanding customer service  to increase the likelihood of customers 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued keeping their dish service over longer periods of time 
our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period 
we incur significant costs to retain our existing customers  mostly by upgrading their equipment to hd and dvr receivers 
as with our subscriber acquisition costs  our retention spending includes the cost of equipment and installation services 
in certain circumstances  we also offer free programming and or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a commitment to receive service for a minimum term 
a component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move 
our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period 
covenants and restrictions related to our senior notes the indentures related to our outstanding senior notes contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  impose limitations on the ability of dish dbs and its restricted subsidiaries to i incur additional indebtedness  ii enter into sale and leaseback transactions  iii pay dividends or make distributions on dish dbs s capital stock or repurchase dish dbs s capital stock  iv make certain investments  v create liens  vi enter into certain transactions with affiliates  vii merge or consolidate with another company  and viii transfer or sell assets 
should we fail to comply with these covenants  all or a portion of the debt under the senior notes could become immediately payable 
the senior notes also provide that the debt may be required to be prepaid if certain change in control events occur 
as of the date of filing of this annual report on form k  dish dbs was in compliance with the covenants 
other we are also vulnerable to fraud  particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers 
while we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions  there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud  which could impact our subscriber growth and churn 
sustained economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft and subscriber fraud  which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue 
obligations and future capital requirements contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   future maturities of our long term debt  capital lease and contractual obligations are summarized as follows payments due by period total thereafter in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations interest expense on long term debt and capital lease obligations satellite related obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations related to blockbuster uk are not included above 
our blockbuster uk operating entities entered into administration in the united kingdom on january   as discussed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
in certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition  the table above does not include million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits which were accrued  as discussed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  and are included on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  we do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months 
other than the guarantees disclosed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  we generally do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
satellites under construction echostar xviii on september   we entered into a contract with ss l for the construction of echostar xviii  a dbs satellite designed with spot beam technology for advanced television services such as hd programming 
this satellite is expected to be launched during future commitments related to this satellite are included in the table above under satellite related obligations  except where noted below 
as of december   we had not procured a launch contract and launch insurance for this satellite  therefore  these costs are not included in our satellite related obligations in the table above 
satellite insurance we generally do not carry commercial insurance for any of the in orbit satellites that we use  other than certain satellites leased from third parties 
we generally do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of launch or in orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk of such failures 
while we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
purchase obligations our purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment  digital broadcast operations  satellite and transponder leases  engineering  and for products and services related to the operation of our dish branded pay tv service 
our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
programming contracts in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content 
these programming commitments are not included in the contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements table above 
the terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases 
our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base 
in addition  our margins may face further downward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms 
future capital requirements we expect to fund our future working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations  existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  and cash generated through raising additional capital 
the amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies  depending on  among other things  the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention  including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued lease programs 
the majority of our capital expenditures for are expected to be driven by the costs associated with subscriber premises equipment  included in our firm purchase obligations  as well as capital expenditures for our satellite related obligations 
these expenditures are necessary to operate and maintain our pay tv service 
consequently  we consider them to be non discretionary 
the amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives  including our plans to expand our national hd offerings and other strategic opportunities that may arise from time to time 
our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time  and could increase materially as a result of increased competition  significant satellite failures  or sustained economic weakness 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future 
volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high yield indebtedness  such as us  to access capital markets at acceptable terms 
these developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position 
wireless spectrum on march   the fcc approved the transfer of mhz of ghz wireless spectrum licenses held by dbsd north america and terrestar to us 
on march   we completed the dbsd transaction and the terrestar transaction  pursuant to which we acquired  among other things  certain satellite assets and wireless spectrum licenses held by dbsd north america and terrestar 
the total consideration to acquire these assets was approximately billion 
this amount includes billion for the dbsd transaction  billion for the terrestar transaction  and the net payment of million to sprint pursuant to the sprint settlement agreement 
our consolidated fcc applications for approval of the license transfers from dbsd north america and terrestar were accompanied by requests for waiver of the fcc s mobile satellite service mss integrated service and spare satellite requirements and various technical provisions 
the fcc denied our requests for waiver of the integrated service and spare satellite requirements but did not initially act on our request for waiver of the various technical provisions 
on march   the fcc released a notice of proposed rule making nprm proposing the elimination of the integrated service  spare satellite and various technical requirements attached to the ghz licenses 
on december   the fcc approved rules that eliminated these requirements and gave notice of its proposed modification of our ghz authorizations to  among other things  allow us to offer single mode terrestrial terminals to customers who do not desire satellite functionality 
on february   the fcc issued an order  which will become effective on march   modifying our ghz licenses to add terrestrial operating authority 
the fcc s order of modification has imposed certain limitations on the use of a portion of this spectrum  including interference protections for other spectrum users and power and emission limits that we presently believe could render mhz of our uplink spectrum effectively unusable for terrestrial services and limit our ability to fully utilize the remaining mhz of our uplink spectrum for terrestrial services 
these limitations could  among other things  impact the finalization of technical standards associated with our wireless business  and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize these licenses 
the new rules also mandate certain interim and final build out requirements for the licenses 
by march  we must provide terrestrial signal coverage and offer terrestrial service to at least of the aggregate population represented by all of the areas covered by the licenses the ghz interim build out requirement 
by march  we must provide terrestrial signal coverage and offer terrestrial service to at least of the population in each area covered by an individual license the ghz final build out requirement 
if we fail to meet the ghz interim build out requirement  the ghz final build out requirement will be accelerated by one year  from march to march if we fail to meet the ghz final build out requirement  our terrestrial authorization for each license area in which we fail to meet the requirement will terminate 
in addition  the fcc is currently considering rules for a spectrum band that is adjacent to our ghz licenses  known as the h block 
if the fcc adopts rules for the h block that do not adequately protect our ghz licenses  there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize the ghz licenses 
as a result of the completion of the dbsd transaction and the terrestar transaction  we will likely be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others to  among other things  finance the commercialization and build out requirements of these licenses and our integration efforts including compliance with regulations applicable to the acquired licenses 
depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization  build out  and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued integration efforts  any such investment or partnership could vary significantly 
additionally  recent consolidation in the wireless telecommunications industry  may  among other things  limit our available options  including our ability to partner with others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on these spectrum licenses or that we will be able to profitably deploy the assets represented by these spectrum licenses  which may affect the carrying value of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations 
in  we paid million to acquire certain mhz wireless spectrum licenses  which were granted to us by the fcc in february these licenses mandate certain interim and final build out requirements 
by june  we must provide signal coverage and offer service to at least of the geographic area in each area covered by each individual license the mhz interim build out requirement 
by the end of our license term june  we must provide signal coverage and offer service to at least of the geographic area in each area covered by each individual license the mhz final build out requirement 
we have recently notified the fcc of our plans to commence signal coverage in select cities within certain of these areas  but we have not yet developed plans for providing signal coverage and offering service in all of these areas 
if we fail to meet the mhz interim build out requirement  the term of our licenses will be reduced  from june to june  and we could face possible fines and the reduction of license area s 
if we fail to meet the mhz final build out requirement  our authorization for each license area in which we fail to meet the requirement will terminate 
to commercialize these licenses and satisfy the associated fcc build out requirements  we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others 
depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build out  any such investment or partnership could vary significantly 
we have recently been engaged in discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction with clearwire 
on january   clearwire issued a press release summarizing the proposed transaction at that time 
later that day  we confirmed that we had formally approached clearwire with respect to a potential strategic transaction on the terms and conditions generally outlined in clearwire s press release 
the terms and conditions for a potential strategic transaction at that time disclosed by clearwire generally provided for the following  among others i we would acquire approximately of clearwire s total spectrum  for approximately billion  and ii we would make an offer to purchase up to all of clearwire s outstanding shares at a price of per share in cash 
this offer would be subject to certain conditions  including that we acquire no less than of the fully diluted shares of clearwire and receive certain governance and minority protection rights 
there is no assurance that we will continue discussions with clearwire or that we will ultimately be able to conclude a transaction with clearwire upon the terms outlined above or at all 
to the extent that we are able to conclude a transaction with clearwire  we may be required to commit a significant portion of our cash and marketable securities to fund these arrangements  and these commitments may cause us to defer or curtail investments in our core business  strategic investments  share repurchases or other transactions that we otherwise may have made 
furthermore  clearwire has experienced significant operating and financial challenges in its recent history 
therefore  any investment we may make in clearwire will be speculative  and we may lose all of the investment 
in addition  we may be required to spend additional capital or raise additional capital to support an investment in clearwire s business and to build out a network to utilize the spectrum acquired  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and implement a business model that will realize a return on a possible transaction with clearwire or that we will be able to profitably deploy the spectrum assets  which may affect the carrying value of these assets and our future financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to successfully address these challenges and risks  our business  financial condition or results of operations will likely suffer 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected prospectively in the period they occur 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
capitalized satellite receivers 
since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs  we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale 
such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment  which is based on  among other things  management s judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence 
because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate  the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on  among other things  historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions 
changes in estimated useful life may impact depreciation and amortization on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
for example  if we had decreased the estimated useful life of our capitalized subscriber equipment by one year  annual depreciation expense would have increased by approximately million 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge in other  net within other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fair value of financial instruments 
fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument 
sustained economic weakness has resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments  including our auction rate securities ars and other investment securities 
for certain of these instruments  there is no or limited observable market data 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and may be a less precise measurement of fair value as compared to financial instruments where observable market data is available 
we make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date  credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including liquidity risks  and estimate of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for example  as of december   we held million of securities that lack observable market quotes  and a decrease in our estimated fair value of these securities would result in a decrease of the reported amount by approximately million 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
we evaluate our dbs satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss will be recorded in a new line item entitled impairments of indefinite lived and long lived assets on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
among other reasons  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or the market approach 
while our impairment tests in indicated the fair value of our intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts  significant changes in our estimates of future cash flows or market data could result in a write down of intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which will be recorded in a new line item entitled impairments of indefinite lived and long lived assets  on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
based on the methodology utilized to test for impairment a decrease in the estimated future cash flows or market value of comparable assets and or  a increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets while all other assumptions remain unchanged would not result in these assets being impaired 
income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
any such valuation allowance is recorded in either income tax provision benefit  net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity deficit on our consolidated balance sheets 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our consolidated results of operations 
uncertainty in tax positions 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax provision benefit  net  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period to general and administrative expenses or litigation expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
business combinations 
when we acquire a business  we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques  including the market approach  income approach and or cost approach 
the accounting standard for business combinations requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired to be recorded at estimated fair value 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or the market approach 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued seasonality historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer gross new subscriber activations than the second half of the year  as is typical in the pay tv service industry 
in addition  the first and fourth quarter generally produce a lower churn rate than the second and third quarter 
however  we cannot provide assurance that this will continue in the future 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures 
backlog we do not have any material backlog of our products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments our investments and debt are exposed to market risks  discussed below 
cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of billion 
of that amount  a total of billion was invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper and corporate obligations described above 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
the value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses  however  this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer 
interest rate risk a change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio  however  we normally hold these investments to maturity 
based on our december  current non strategic investment portfolio of billion  a hypothetical change in average interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value due to the limited duration of our investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended december  of 
a change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at different rates as the instruments mature 
a hypothetical decrease in average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
strategic marketable investment securities as of december   we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of billion 
these investments  which are held for strategic and financial purposes  are concentrated in a small number of companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
in addition  a significant portion of the value of these investments is concentrated in the debt securities of a single issuer 
the fair value of the securities of that single issuer as of december  was million 
these debt securities have a call option  held by the issuer  upon days notice after december  the call option price is less than the fair market value of these debt securities and  if exercised  proceeds would be less than our recorded fair market value and therefore  reduce our unrealized gains recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within total stockholders equity deficit  on our consolidated balance sheets 
this potential reduction in our unrealized gain related to the call option on these debt securities would have no impact on our results of operations 
in addition  this single issuer has indicated that it will need substantial additional capital to meet its business and financial obligations beyond the next months 
the fair value of certain of the debt securities in our investment portfolio  including those of that single issuer  can be adversely impacted by  among other things  the issuers respective performance and ability to obtain any necessary additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
in general  the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment securities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued underlying business 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
restricted cash and marketable investment securities and noncurrent marketable and other investment securities restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above 
based on our december  investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities 
noncurrent auction rate and other investment securities as of december   we held investments in ars of million  which are reported at fair value 
events in the credit markets have reduced or eliminated current liquidity for certain of our ars investments 
as a result  we classify these investments as noncurrent assets as we intend to hold these investments until they recover or mature  and therefore interest rate risk associated with these securities is mitigated 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
long term debt as of december   we had long term debt of billion  excluding capital lease obligations  on our consolidated balance sheets 
we estimated the fair value of this debt to be approximately billion using quoted market prices for our publicly traded debt  which constitutes approximately of our debt 
the fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
to the extent interest rates increase  our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt or raise additional debt 
as of december   a hypothetical increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
derivative financial instruments from time to time  we speculate using derivative financial instruments  such amounts  however  are typically insignificant
