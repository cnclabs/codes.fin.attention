item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contractual obligations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate expenditures for our future plant development and other activities  or seek to enter into a business combination transaction with or sell assets to another company 
we could also be forced to license to third parties the rights to commercialize additional products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
the transactions outlined above may not be available to us when needed or on terms acceptable or favorable to us 
the decline in our stock price makes the cost of obtaining additional equity capital more expensive to our shareholders by reason of the attendant dilution 
further  our stock price decline and related decline in market capitalization has limited our ability to sell shares of common stock from our shelf registration statement in order to obtain capital 
construction and operations of plants based on the syntroleum technologies will be subject to risks of delay and cost overruns 
the construction and operation of plants based on our technologies will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns 
delays in construction or operation of the plant could directly impact the capital expenditures or working capital 
increases in costs could result in increased equity payments from parent companies 
dynamic fuels plant being shut down for an extended period could adversely affect syntroleum financial position 
the dynamic fuels plant is operated at a single facility in geismar louisiana 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption to this facility due to flooding  hurricane  fire or other extreme factors beyond our control could damage our capital equipment or supporting infrastructure and materially impair the ability of the plant to operate 
such a disruption could result in lost revenues  increased costs and or reduced profits 
if the plant is shut down  it may experience a prolonged start up period  regardless of the reason for the shutdown 
such start up periods could range from several days to several months  depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors 
the shutdown of the plant for a substantial period of time for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the dynamic fuels plant has remained shut down and in standby mode  primarily because of adverse economic conditions  since completion of a maintenance turnaround in december  we have not yet agreed with tyson on the economic conditions for plant start up 
we could experience disagreements with our joint venture partners which could adversely affect the operations or financial condition of our plants 
the operation of dynamic fuels is to be exercised jointly by representatives of the company and tyson equally  with no member exercising control 
decisions surrounding operation and financing of the plant generally require both members to agree 
disagreements between the members or a modification in the level of participation from one of the members could significantly impact the plant and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we need to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market to be able to access adequate funding from time to time 
we could face de listing issues that would impair the liquidity of our stock and our availability to access the capital markets 
we are required to maintain standards for listing of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
one of those standards is that our common stock maintains a minimum price of at least per share 
on june  we received a nasdaq staff deficiency letter  indicating our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion under the marketplace rule a 
we were provided calendar days  or until december  to regain compliance 
on december  we received a nasdaq notification indicating we were eligible for an additional calendar day compliance period or until june  to regain compliance 
their determination was based on our meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the capital market with the exception of the bid price requirement  and our written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split  if necessary 
we can make no assurance that we will be able to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market 

table of contents we have incurred losses 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
because we do not have an operating history upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be based  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by small companies seeking to develop new and rapidly evolving technologies 
to address these risks we must  among other things  continue to attract investment capital  respond to competitive factors  continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel and commercialize our technologies 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks  and we may not achieve or sustain profitability 
our anticipated expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future operating activities and on historical financial data 
capital expenditures will depend on progress we make in developing various projects on which we are currently working 
increased revenues or cash flows may not result from these expenses 
if prices or margins for crude oil  natural gas  coal  vegetable oil  biomass and fats and other commodities are unfavorable  plants based on the syntroleum technologies may not be economical 
because the products from plants utilizing our technologies are expected to compete in markets with conventional petroleum products  an increase in alternative feedstock prices relative to prices for oil  or a decrease in prices for oil relative to alternative feedstock prices  could adversely affect the operating results of these plants 
higher than anticipated costs for the catalysts and other materials used in these plants could also adversely affect operating results 
factors that could cause changes in the prices and availability of oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  oils and refined products include changes in supply and demand balance of petroleum feedstocks  refined petroleum products  agricultural commodities variances impacted by crop yields  planting decisions  protein complex variances  weather conditions  domestic and foreign government regulation  actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  political conditions in countries producing feedstocks  supply of crude oil  natural gas  coal  biomass fats  greases and oils  fuel switching between various sources of energy natural gas  coal  solar  fats  oils and greases  biomass  or other renewable or non renewable  capacities of pipelines  seasonality  price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions 
our success depends on the performance of our executive officers and key personnel  the loss of who would disrupt our business operations 
we depend to a large extent on the performance of our executive officers  edward g 
roth  our chief executive officer  karen l 
power  our senior vice president and principal financial officer  and certain key personnel 
our ability to implement our business strategy may be constrained and the timing of implementation may be impacted if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel 
at december   we had full time employees 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
we have entered into employment agreements with several key employees 
we depend on strategic relationships with feedstock suppliers  site owners engineering companies  and customers 
if we are not successful in entering into and achieving the benefits of these relationships  this could negatively impact our business 
our licensee s typically enter into commercial arrangements with feedstock suppliers  construction contractors  engineering service companies  site owners  equipment manufacturers  and customers 
these relationships may take the form of joint ventures with other private parties or local government bodies  contractual arrangements with other companies  or minority investments from third parties 
there can be no assurances that we or our licensees will be able to establish and maintain these strategic relationships 
in addition  the dynamics of our relationships with strategic participants may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise incur in order to fulfill our obligations 
if we do not successfully establish or maintain strategic relationships  our business may be negatively affected 

table of contents our operating results may be volatile due to a variety of factors and are not a meaningful indicator of future performance 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in future annual and quarterly operating results because of the unpredictability of many factors that impact our business 
these factors include government legislation  subsidies on renewable product  and varying regulatory quotas  volatile price of commodities used and produced  overcapacity in the renewable fuels industry  demand for licenses or other technology transfer agreements for our technologies and receipt and revenue recognition of license fees  timing of any construction by us or our licensees of plants  introduction or enhancement of ft and renewable fuels technologies by us and our competitors  market acceptance of new technologies  and general economic conditions 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  it may be that in some future year or quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive laws relating to the protection of the environment  and these laws may increase the cost of designing  constructing and operating our plants based on our technologies or affect demand for the products of these plants 
if we violate any of the laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  we may be subject to substantial fines  criminal sanctions or third party lawsuits and may be required to install costly pollution control equipment or curtail operations 
plants built with our technologies will generally be required to obtain environmental  industrial siting  construction and numerous other permits 
compliance with these permits may increase the costs of designing  constructing and operating our plants or delay plant development 
new legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we may also face exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters with respect to our previously owned real estate 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position  or financial condition 
terrorist threats and us military actions could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere could occur 
these and like developments could cause instability in the world s financial and insurance markets and increase political and economic instability in the geographic areas in which we may wish to operate 
these developments could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil  natural gas and the feedstocks for our plants and the cost and availability of insurance 
in addition  these developments could adversely affect our ability to access capital 
united states government regulations effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries 
these regulations could be expanded to cover countries where we may wish to operate in the future 
these developments could subject the operations of our company to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance  such as a leak  fire or explosion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

operations to date have consisted of activities related to the commercialization of our renewable fuels technology and previously consisted of research and development designed to convert carbonaceous material biomass  coal  natural gas and petroleum coke into synthetic liquid hydrocarbons including such products as diesel  jet fuel hrj  kerosene  naphtha  and propane 
operating revenues our revenues were primarily generated from the sale or transfer of our technologies  engineering technical services from third parties and from dynamic fuels and royalties from dynamic fuels plant production 
in the future  we expect to receive revenue from engineering technical services  royalties and other income from our investment in dynamic fuels  sales and licensing of our technologies and product sales or royalties for the use of our technologies in facilities in which we own an equity interest 
we record revenue related to royalty fees based on the production of the facility 
income and loss from our investment in dynamic fuels is recorded below operating income  as income loss in equity of dynamic fuels  llc 
the income or loss is based on our proportionate equity ownership of the plant 
our future operating revenues and investments in projects will depend on the successful commercial operation of the dynamic fuels facility

syntroleum contributed an additional million and tyson contributed an additional million in cash capital contributions by december  each member made million in working capital loans to the entity by december  the million non interest bearing loans do not have a stated term but will be repaid to each partner upon dynamic fuels generating sufficient operating cash flow 
on february   syntroleum made an additional million working capital loan to dynamic fuels 
tyson made an additional million working capital loan for a total of million on february  we will likely need to fund future working capital needs of dynamic 
on october   dynamic fuels issued tax exempt bonds through the louisiana public facilities authority in the amount of million at an initial interest rate of to fund construction of the plant 
the bonds required a letter of credit in the amount of million as collateral for dynamic fuels obligations under the bonds 
tyson agreed under the terms of the warrant agreement to provide credit support for the entire million bond issue for which we issued tyson warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock for per share 
tyson exercised the warrants in the interest rate for the bonds is a daily floating interest rate and may change significantly from this amount 
in the fourth quarter of  dynamic fuels entered into an interest rate swap which had the effect of locking in the interest rate at for a period of years with declining swap coverage 
this debt funding is in addition to the equity contributions provided by each member 
the renewable diesel produced by dynamic fuels is quality tested and meets astm d standards for diesel 
our jet fuel meets all petroleum based jet fuel specifications for astm d  commercial jet fuel  as well as hrj  military jet fuel 
the production of our fuel was eligible for the tax credit per gallon of renewable diesel under the energy independence act and energy policy act of epact in and epact further designated a per gallon alternative fuels mixture credit afmc for the production of qualified alternative fuels  of which dynamic fuels renewable naphtha qualifies 
these tax credits are generated upon mixture with allowed motor vehicle fuels such as petroleum diesel and gasoline 
prior to receiving epa part registration on august   dynamic fuels renewable naphtha was not eligible to generate the

these tax credits are typically renewed at the end of each year in what is known as tax extenders bills 
these tax credits expired on december  and were not renewed until november  retroactively for and extended through december  these tax credits again expired unrenewed on december  on january   president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which reinstated the credits for and retroactively reinstated the credits for dynamic fuels or its owners will receive a combined total of approximately million for production from the tax credit and will receive the alternative fuels mixture credit of per gallon for a portion of the renewable naphtha also produced during 
table of contents in  we received approval for registration of our neat renewable diesel from the environmental protection agency 
the registration of the neat renewable diesel allows combustion in regular on road engines up to percent renewable fuel  which means no blending of petroleum based diesel is required

the retroactive reinstatement of the blenders tax credit for diesel production is estimated to result in a net payment to dynamic fuels of approximately million 
we expect to recognize our share of the tax credit in the first quarter of foreign currency exchange 
changes in the foreign currency exchange are due to fluctuation in the value of the australian dollar compared to the us dollar 
the foreign currency changes result from translation adjustments from our license with the commonwealth of australia which is denominated in australian dollars 
these changes have no cash impact 
income loss from discontinued operations 
changes in income from discontinued operations primarily resulted from lower than expected dismantlement costs in resulting in a gain from reducing our asset retirement liability associated with the catoosa demonstration facility to zero 
liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents

if we obtain additional funds by issuing equity  dilution to stockholders may occur 
in addition  preferred stock could be issued without stockholder approval  and the terms of our preferred stock could include dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting and other rights that are more favorable than the rights of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing might be available 
we expect that we will fund additional short term working capital needs of dynamic fuels through working capital loans in as stated previously  we have contributed cash in the amount of million to the capital of dynamic fuels since inception  have loaned dynamic fuels million and have receivables due from dynamic fuels of  although management remains positive about the future of dynamic fuels  if dynamic fuels fails to achieve profitability  this entire investment could be subject to loss
