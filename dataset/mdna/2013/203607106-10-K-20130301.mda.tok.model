item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a primarily reviews the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the past two years  although in some circumstances a period longer than two years is covered in order to comply with securities and exchange commission disclosure requirements or to more fully explain long term trends 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information on page and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear on pages through all references in the discussion to the financial condition and results of operations are to the consolidated position and results of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole 
unless otherwise noted  all earnings per share eps figures disclosed in the md a refer to diluted eps  interest income  net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis 
the term this year and equivalent terms refer to results in calendar year  last year and equivalent terms refer to calendar year  and all references to income statement results correspond to full year activity unless otherwise noted 
this md a contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of community bank system  inc these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies as a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the company s business  management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations 
the policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted accounting principles gaap  but also reflects management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the company s financial performance 
it is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance  or the level of subjectivity in the selection process 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management believes that the critical accounting estimates include acquired loans acquired loans are initially recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
the carryover of allowance for loan losses is prohibited as any credit losses in the loans are included in the determination of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date 
fair values for acquired loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  default rates  loss severity  payment speeds  collateral values and discount rate 
subsequent to the acquisition of acquired impaired loans  gaap requires the continued estimation of expected cash flows to be received 
this estimation requires numerous assumptions  interpretations and judgments using internal and third party credit quality information 
changes in expected cash flows could result in the recognition of impairment through provision for credit losses 
for acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition  credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value 
subsequent to the purchase date  the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for the non impaired acquired loans is similar to originated loans  however  the company records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance exceeds any remaining pooled discounts for loans evaluated collectively for impairment 
for loans individually evaluated for impairment  a provision is recorded when the required allowance exceeds any remaining discount on the loan 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses in the company s loan portfolio 
determination of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective 
it requires significant estimates including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  appraisal values of underlying collateral for collateral dependent laons  and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans which is based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
investment securities investment securities are classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on the company s ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  as a separate component of shareholders equity and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments  or a discounted cash flow model using market estimates of interest rates and volatility 
investment securities with significant declines in fair value are evaluated to determine whether they should be considered other than temporarily impaired 
an unrealized loss is generally deemed to be other than temporary and a credit loss is deemed to exist if the present value of the expected future cash flows is less than the amortized cost basis of the debt security 
the credit loss component of an other than temporary impairment write down is recorded in earnings  while the remaining portion of the impairment loss is recognized in other comprehensive income loss  provided the company does not intend to sell the underlying debt security  and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovery of the full value of its amortized cost basis 
retirement benefits the company provides defined benefit pension benefits to eligible employees and post retirement health and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retirees 
the company also provides deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement plans for selected current and former employees and officers 
expense under these plans is charged to current operations and consists of several components of net periodic benefit cost based on various actuarial assumptions regarding future experience under the plans  including  but not limited to  discount rate  rate of future compensation increases  mortality rates  future health care costs and the expected return on plan assets 
provision for income taxes the company is subject to examinations from various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions 
management believes that the assumptions and judgments used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate 
should tax laws change or the taxing authorities determine that management s assumptions were inappropriate  an adjustment may be required which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
intangible assets as a result of acquisitions  the company has acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets at the acquisition date 
goodwill is evaluated at least annually  or when business conditions suggest impairment may have occurred and will be reduced to its carrying value through a charge to earnings if impairment exists 
core deposits and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives 
the determination of whether or not impairment exists is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic and market conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on the company s results of operations

this year s qualified and nonqualified retirement plan expense increased million due to the additional employees added with the wilber acquisition  and the decrease in the liability discount rate from to  partially offset by higher returns on plan assets 
qualified and nonqualified pension expense in was consistent with qualified pension plan expense decreased approximately million due primarily to higher returns on plan assets  partially offset by a lower discount rate 
the k plan expense for increased approximately million from due to additional participants being added as a result of the hsbc  first niagara and wilber acquisitions 
the k plan expense increased million in as compared to due to the additional participants as a result of the wilber acquisition 
the three assumptions that have the largest impact on the calculation of annual pension expense are the discount rate utilized  the rate applied to future compensation increases and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
see note k to the financial statements for further information about the pension plan 
total non personnel noninterest expenses  excluding one time acquisition expenses  litigation settlement and contract termination charges increased million  or  in excluding incremental direct expenses related to the retail branches acquired from hsbc  first niagara and wilber  non personnel noninterest expenses as defined above increased million or 
as displayed in table  this was largely caused by higher data processing and communications up million in total and up million excluding incremental acquired branch expenses  legal and professional fees up million in total and up million excluding the incremental acquired branch expense  occupancy equipment up million in total and down million excluding incremental acquired branch expense  property and other writedowns up million in total and up million excluding incremental acquired branch expense  office supplies and postage up million in total and up million excluding the incremental acquired branch expense  and amortization of intangible assets up million due to acquisitions  partially offset by lower fdic insurance premiums down million in total and down million excluding incremental acquired branch expense 
the higher data processing and communication cost is due to increased level of company wide technology enhancements  expenses related to the higher level of residential mortgage originations and an increased level of electronic transactions 
the increase in legal and professional fees includes costs related to the litigation settlement charge  additional compliance related activities and processing costs related to the higher level of residential mortgage originations in the company continually evaluates all aspects of its operating expense structure and is diligent about identifying opportunities to improve operating efficiencies 
during the third quarter of  the company consolidated five of its branch offices 
this realignment reduced market overlap and further strengthened its branch network  and reflects management s focus on achieving long term performance improvements through proactive  strategic decision making 
the fdic imposes an assessment against all depository institutions for deposit insurance based on the risk category of the institution and the institution s deposits 
effective in april   the fdic changed the calculation of the assessment to be based upon a percentage of average consolidated bank assets less average tangible capital as opposed to a percentage of average deposits which has been used in the past 
the result for company was a savings of approximately million and million for and  respectively  in deposit insurance assessments 
total non personnel noninterest expenses  excluding one time acquisition expenses and contract termination charges decreased million or in versus excluding expenses related to the retail branches acquired from wilber  non personnel noninterest expenses as defined above declined million or

amortization of intangibles decreased in  a result of accelerated amortization methodologies employed and the core deposit intangible from a acquisition became fully amortized in the lower data processing and communications costs are a result of the conversion of the company s core banking system in the second half of acquisition expenses  litigation settlement and contract termination charges totaled million in up million from the costs incurred for acquisition and contract termination charges in the prior year 
acquisition expenses for totaled million and were associated with the acquisition of the hsbc and first niagara branches 
additionally  included an accrual of million pertaining to the settlement of a class action lawsuit related to the processing of retail debit card transactions and its impact on overdraft fees 
the company had considerable affirmative defenses to the claims  however  the settlement the company was able to achieve was  in its judgment  a superior outcome for shareholders when measured against the cost and the staff resources required for litigation 
acquisition expenses and contract termination charges totaled million in  primarily associated with the wilber acquisition which closed in april  up million from the cost incurred for acquisition and contract termination charges in the prior year 
acquisition expenses and contract termination charges totaled million in comprised of million of acquisition expenses related to the wilber acquisition and million of contract termination fees related to the core banking system conversion in the third quarter of income taxes the company estimates its income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe the respective tax authorities  plus the impact of deferred tax items 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note i of the consolidated financial statements beginning on page accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
if the final resolution of taxes payable differs from its estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions  adjustments to tax expense may be required 
the effective tax rate for was as compared to in  reflective of similar proportional levels of income from both fully taxable and non taxable sources 
the effective tax rate for increased percentage points from the prior year to  principally a result of a higher proportion of income being generated from fully taxable sources 
the effective tax rate for was  reflecting the higher level of income from fully taxable sources 
capital shareholders equity ended at million  up million  or  from one year earlier 
this increase reflects net income of million  million from common stock issuance  a million increase in other comprehensive income  million from the issuance of shares through employee stock plans  and million from stock based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by common stock dividends declared of million 
the change in accumulated other comprehensive income was comprised of a million increase in the market value adjustment mva  represents the after tax  unrealized change in value of available for sale securities in the company s investment portfolio and a million charge based on the funded status of the company s employee retirement plans

shareholders equity ended at million  up million  or  from one year earlier 
this increase reflects million from shares issued in conjunction with the wilber acquisition  net income of million  a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income  million from the issuance of shares through employee stock plans and million from stock based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by common stock dividends declared of million 
the change in other comprehensive income was comprised of a million increase in the mva  a million charge based on the funded status of the company s employee retirement plans and a million increase in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedge 
excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both and  capital rose by million  or 
shares outstanding increased by million during the year comprised of million shares added through common stock issued from treasury shares in the wilber acquisition in the second quarter and million added through employee stock plans 
the company s ratio of tier capital to assets or tier leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum for an institution to be considered well capitalized  increased two basis points to end the year at 
this was the result of a increase in tier capital primarily  from net income generation and the public stock offering in conjunction with the hsbc and first niagara branch acquisitions  being greater than the year over year increase in fourth quarter average net assets excludes investment market value adjustment  intangible assets net of related deferred tax liabilities and disallowed mortgage service rights due mostly to the hsbc and first niagara branch acquisitions 
the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was at the end of versus one year earlier 
the increase was due to common shareholders equity growing at a greater pace than tangible assets and includes the positive impact of the million increase in the equity component of the investment market value adjustment 
the company manages organic and acquired growth in a manner that enables it to continue to build upon its strong capital base and maintain the company s ability to take advantage of future strategic growth opportunities 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth was a result of the million shares issued in january in support of the hsbc and first niagara branch acquisitions and million shares issued through employee stock programs 
in addition  dividends per share of for increased from in  a result of quarterly dividends per share being raised from to a increase in the third quarter of and from to in the third quarter of the increase in quarterly dividends marked the twentieth consecutive year of dividend increases for the company 
the dividend payout ratio for this year was compared to in  and in the dividend payout ratio increased during because dividends increased while net income increased at a slower rate of 
the payout ratio in was consistent with because dividends paid increased while net income increased 
liquidity liquidity risk is a measure of the company s ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost and minimize any loss 
the bank maintains appropriate liquidity levels in both normal operating environments as well as stressed environments 
the company must be capable of meeting all obligations to its customers at any time and  therefore  the active management of its liquidity position remains an important management role 
the bank has appointed the asset liability committee to manage liquidity risk using policy guidelines and limits on indicators of potential liquidity risk 
the indicators are monitored using a scorecard with three risk level limits 
these risk indicators measure core liquidity and funding needs  capital at risk and change in available funding sources 
the risk indicators are monitored using such statistics as the core basic surplus ratio  unencumbered securities to average assets  free loan collateral to average assets  loans to deposits  deposits to total funding and borrowings to total funding ratios 
given the uncertain nature of our customers liquidity demands as well as the company desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  the company must have available adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows  liquidity must be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from correspondent banks  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and the federal reserve bank of new york 
other funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time  including wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  large certificates of deposit and the brokered cd market 
the primary source of non deposit funds are fhlb advances  of which million were outstanding at december  the bank s primary sources of liquidity are its liquid assets  as well as unencumbered securities that can be used to collateralize additional funding 
at december   the bank had million of cash and cash equivalents of which million are interest earning deposits held at the federal reserve 
the bank also had million in unused federal home loan bank borrowing capacity based on the company s year end collateral levels 
additionally  the company has billion of unencumbered securities that could be pledged at the federal home loan bank or federal reserve to obtain additional funding 
there is million available in unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks 
the company s primary approach to measuring short term liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the amount of cash that could be made available within days calculated as liquid assets less short term liabilities as a percentage of average assets  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
as of december   the ratios were for days and for days  excluding the company capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank and other sources 
there is a sufficient amount of liquidity available given the company s internal policy requirement of 
a sources and uses statement is used by the company to measure intermediate liquidity risk over the next twelve months 
as of december   there is more than enough liquidity available during the next year to cover projected cash outflows 
in addition  stress tests on the cash flows are performed in various scenarios ranging from high probability events with a low impact on the liquidity position to low probability events with a high impact on the liquidity position 
the results of the stress tests as of december  indicate the bank has sufficient sources of funds for the next year in all stressed scenarios 
to measure longer term liquidity  a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time 
this five year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan and other asset growth over the next five years 
though remote  the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions 
accordingly  management has addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan  which has been reviewed and approved by both the company s board of directors and the asset liability management committee 
the plan addresses the actions that the company would take in response to both a short term and long term funding crisis 
a short term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system  either internal or external  which disrupts orderly short term funding operations 
such a crisis should be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings 
a long term funding crisis would most likely be the result of drastic credit deterioration at the company 
management believes that both potential circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events 
intangible assets the changes in intangible assets by reporting segment for the year ended december  are summarized as follows table intangible assets balance at balance at s omitted december  additions amortization impairment december  banking segment goodwill core deposit intangibles total banking segment other segment goodwill other intangibles total other segment total intangible assets at the end of totaled million  an increase of million from the prior year end due to million of additional intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of hsbc and first niagara branches  offset by million of amortization during the year 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and the value of core deposits and customer relationships that arise from acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill at december  totaled million  comprised of million related to banking acquisitions and million arising from the acquisition of financial services businesses 
goodwill is subjected to periodic impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net assets exceeds their fair value  which would necessitate a write down of goodwill 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analyses during the first quarters of and and no adjustments were necessary for the banking or financial services businesses 
the impairment analysis was based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires the selection of a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific performance and risk indicators 
management believes that there is a low probability of future impairment with regard to the goodwill associated with its whole bank  branch and financial services businesses acquisitions 
core deposit intangibles represent the value of non time deposits acquired in excess of funding that could have been obtained in the capital markets 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or straight line basis over periods ranging from seven to twenty years 
the recognition of customer relationship intangibles arose due to the acquisitions of the trust department of wilber  cai  abg  hb t  harbridge and the cbna insurance agency 
these assets were determined based on a methodology that calculates the present value of the projected future net income derived from the acquired customer base 
these assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over periods ranging from seven to twelve years 
loans the company s loans outstanding  by type  as of december are as follows table loans outstanding s omitted consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct home equity gross loans allowance for loan losses loans  net of allowance for loan losses daily average of total loans as disclosed in table above  gross loans outstanding of billion as of year end increased million or compared to december  as a result of the hsbc and first niagara branch acquisitions in the third quarter of  as well as strong organic growth in the consumer mortgage and consumer indirect and direct portfolios 
excluding loans acquired from hsbc and first niagara  loans increased million or 
the low interest rate environment and business development efforts contributed to strong organic consumer mortgage and consumer indirect lending activity during excluding loans acquired from hsbc and first niagara  the business lending and home equity portfolios declined as compared to year end the home equity portfolio  excluding loans acquired from hsbc and first niagara decreased due primarily to pay downs associated with the high level of mortgage refinancing being conducted in the low interest rate environment  as well as the continued deleveraging activities being undertaken by consumers in the current economic environment 
the compounded annual growth rate cagr for the company s total loan portfolio between and was  comprised of approximately of organic growth  with the remainder coming from acquisitions 
the greatest overall expansion occurred in the consumer mortgage segment  which grew at a cagr  driven by robust mortgage refinancing volumes over the last five years  as well as the acquisition of consumer oriented banks and branches 
the consumer indirect and direct segment grew at a compounded annual growth rate of from to consumer indirect and direct loans consist of personal loans originated both in the branch network and in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships 
the business lending segment grew at a compounded annual growth rate of driven by acquisitions during the five year period 
the home equity lending segment grew at a compounded annual growth rate of from to  including the impact from acquisitions 
the weighting of the components of the company s loan portfolio enables it to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding at the end of were made to consumers borrowing on an installment  line of credit or residential mortgage loan basis 
the business lending portfolio is also broadly diversified by industry type as demonstrated by the following distributions at year end commercial real estate  healthcare  restaurant lodging  general services  agriculture  manufacturing  retail trade  construction  wholesale trade and motor vehicle and parts dealers 
a variety of other industries with less than a share of the total portfolio comprise the remaining 
the consumer mortgage portion of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of fixed and adjustable rate residential lending and includes no exposure to subprime  alt a or other higher risk mortgage products 
consumer mortgages increased million or in excluding mortgage loans acquired from hsbc and first niagara  mortgage lending increased million or 
during the year ended december   the company originated and sold an additional million of longer term  fixed rate residential mortgages 
during the year ended december   the company originated and sold million of residential mortgages  principally to fannie mae 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company chose to retain in portfolio the majority of mortgage production 
consumer mortgage volume has been strong over the last few years due to historically low long term interest rates and comparatively stable real estate valuations in the company s primary markets 
the company s solid performance during a tumultuous period in the overall industry is a reflection of the high quality profile of its portfolio and its ability to successfully meet customer needs at a time when some national mortgage lenders have restricted their lending activities in many of the company s markets 
interest rates  expected duration  and the company s overall interest rate sensitivity profile continue to be the most significant factors in determining whether the company chooses to retain versus sell and service portions of its new mortgage generation 
the combined total of general purpose business lending  including agricultural related and dealer floor plans  as well as mortgages on commercial property  is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
the business lending portfolio increased million or in excluding loans acquired from hsbc and first niagara  business lending balances declined million from one year ago 
generating growth in this segment has remained challenging primarily due to a prolonged soft economic environment and highly competitive conditions 
in addition  the company proactively managed payout of certain unprofitable loan relationships principally acquired during the company maintains its commitment to generating growth in its business portfolio in a manner that adheres to its twin goals of maintaining strong asset quality and producing profitable margins 
the company has continued to invest in additional personnel  technology  and business development resources to further strengthen its capabilities in this important product category 
during the small business lending platform was expanded to further develop efficiencies in the delivery of the loan product in this sector 
the following table shows the maturities and type of interest rates for business and construction loans as of december  table maturity distribution of business and construction loans s omitted maturing in one year or less maturing after one but within five years maturing after five years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total fixed or predetermined interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates total scheduled repayments are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due 
consumer installment loans  both those originated directly such as personal installment loans and lines of credit  and indirectly originated predominantly in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships  increased million or from one year ago 
excluding the impact of consumer installment loans acquired from hsbc and first niagara  the consumer installment indirect lending portfolio had organic growth of million or  while the consumer installment direct lending portfolio increased million or 
the volume of new and used vehicles sales to upper tier credit profile customers in the company s primary markets has improved in recent periods 
the company is focused on maintaining the solid profitability produced by its in market and contiguous market indirect portfolio  while continuing to pursue its disciplined  long term approach to expanding its dealer network 
a by product of the still historically low new vehicle sales rates has been an improvement in used car valuations  where the majority of the company s installment lending is concentrated 
market trends predict moderate increases over the prior year levels and this will create opportunity for the company to continue to produce solid indirect loan growth 
home equity loans increased million or from one year ago 
excluding the home equity loans acquired from hsbc and first niagara  the home equity portfolio decreased million or from one year ago  in part due to home equity loans being paid off or down as part of the high level of mortgage refinancing activity that occurred throughout and continued in in the low rate environment 
in addition  home equity utilization has been adversely impacted by the heightened level of consumer deleveraging activity that is occurring in response to the continued longer term slow growth economic conditions 
asset quality the following table presents information concerning nonperforming assets as of december table nonperforming assets s omitted nonaccrual loans consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct home equity total nonaccrual loans accruing loans days delinquent consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct home equity total accruing loans days delinquent nonperforming loans consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct home equity total nonperforming loans other real estate oreo total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses total loans allowance for legacy loan losses total legacy loans allowance for loan losses nonperforming loans allowance for legacy loans nonperforming legacy loans nonperforming loans total loans legacy nonperforming loans legacy total loans nonperforming assets total loans and other real estate delinquent loans days old to nonaccruing to total loans loan loss provision to net charge offs legacy loan loss provision to net charge offs legacy loans exclude loans acquired after january  these ratios are included for comparative purposes to prior periods 
the company places a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes ninety days past due  or sooner if management concludes collection of interest is doubtful  except when  in the opinion of management  it is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
as shown in table above  nonperforming loans  defined as nonaccruing loans  accruing loans days or more past due and restructured loans ended at million  down approximately million from one year earlier 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans decreased basis points from the prior year 
excluding nonperforming acquired loans  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was  an increase of two basis points from the prior year 
the ratio of nonperforming assets which includes other real estate owned  or oreo  in addition to nonperforming loans to total loans plus oreo decreased to at year end  down four basis points from one year earlier 
the company s success at keeping these ratios at favorable levels despite weak economic conditions was the result of continued focus on maintaining strict underwriting standards  early problem recognition  and effective collection and recovery efforts 
at year end  the company was managing oreo properties with a value of million  as compared to oreo properties with a value of million a year earlier 
the oreo balance includes two large commercial properties totaling million 
despite the increase in oreo balances  the current level still reflects the low level of foreclosure activity in the company s markets and its specific portfolio in comparison to national markets 
approximately of the nonperforming loans at december  are related to the business lending portfolio  which is comprised of business loans broadly diversified by industry type 
the decrease in nonperforming loans in the business lending portfolio is primarily related to two large relationships  one of which was foreclosed and currently is included in oreo 
with the economic downturn  certain businesses financial performance and position have deteriorated  and consequently the level of nonperforming loans remains higher than historical levels 
approximately of nonperforming loans at december  are related to the consumer mortgage portfolio 
collateral values of residential properties within the company s market area did not experience the significant declines in values that other parts of the country have encountered 
however  the continued soft economic conditions and high unemployment levels have adversely impacted consumers and businesses alike and have resulted in higher nonperforming levels 
the remaining seven percent of nonperforming loans relate to consumer installment and home equity loans 
the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans ratio  a general measure of coverage adequacy  was at the end of compared to at year end and at december   reflective of the higher level of nonperforming loans 
excluding acquired loans  the ratio of allowance for legacy loans to nonperforming legacy loans was at the end of  compared to at year end and at december  members of senior management  special asset officers  and lenders review all delinquent and nonaccrual loans and oreo regularly  in order to identify deteriorating situations  monitor known problem credits and discuss any needed changes to collection efforts  if warranted 
based on the group s consensus  a relationship may be assigned a special assets officer or other senior lending officer to review the loan  meet with the borrowers  assess the collateral and recommend an action plan 
this plan could include foreclosure  restructuring the loans  issuing demand letters  or other actions 
the company s larger criticized credits are also reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by senior credit administration  special assets and commercial lending management to monitor their status and discuss relationship management plans 
commercial lending management reviews the entire criticized loan portfolio on a monthly basis 
total delinquencies  defined as loans days or more past due or in nonaccrual status  finished the current year at of total loans outstanding  versus at the end of as of year end  total delinquency ratios for commercial loans  consumer installment loans  real estate mortgages and home equity loans were   and  respectively 
these measures were   and  respectively  as of december  delinquency levels  particularly in the to days category  tend to be somewhat volatile due to their measurement at a point in time  and therefore management believes that it is useful to evaluate this ratio over a longer period 
the average quarter end delinquency ratio for total loans in was  as compared to an average of in and in  reflective of the underlying economic conditions and the typical delayed impact they have on loan performance characteristics 
loans are considered modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr when  due to a borrower s financial difficulties  the company makes a concession s to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
these modifications primarily include  among others  an extension of the term of the loan or granting a period with reduced or no principal and or interest payments that can be caught up with payments made over the remaining term of the loan or at maturity 
historically  the company has had very few tdrs 
during  new regulatory guidance was issued by the occ addressing the accounting of certain loans that have been discharged in chapter bankruptcy 
in accordance with this new guidance  loans that have been discharged in chapter bankruptcy but not reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as tdrs  irrespective of payment history or delinquency status  even if the repayment terms for the loan have not been otherwise modified 
the company s lien position against the underlying collateral remains unchanged 
pursuant to that guidance  the company records a charge off equal to any portion of the carrying value that exceeds the net realizable value of the collateral 
the amount of loss incurred in was immaterial 
with this new interpretation  the company had loans totaling million considered to be nonaccruing tdrs and loans totaling million considered to be accruing tdrs 
the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years are as follows table allowance for loan losses activity years ended december  s omitted except for ratios allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct home equity total charge offs recoveries consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct home equity total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses provision for acquired impaired loans acquired allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses at end of period net charge offs to average loans outstanding consumer mortgage business lending consumer indirect consumer direct home equity total loans this addition is attributable to loans acquired from citizens in as displayed in table above  total net charge offs in were million  up million from the prior year due to higher charge offs in all portfolios 
net charge offs in were million lower than s level  due to lower levels of net charge offs in the business lending and consumer installment portfolios  partially offset by higher levels of net charge offs in the consumer mortgage and home equity portfolios 
due to the significant increases in average loan balances over time due to acquisition and organic growth  management believes that net charge offs as a percent of average loans net charge off ratio offers a more meaningful representation of asset quality trends 
the net charge off ratio for was up eight and two basis points from and  respectively  but was one basis point lower than gross charge offs as a percentage of average loans was in as compared to in and in continued strong recovery efforts were evidenced by recoveries of million in  representing of average gross charge offs for the latest two years  compared to in and in business loan net charge offs increased in  totaling million or of average business loans outstanding versus million or in  reflective of underlying economic conditions and their lagged effected on loan credit performance 
consumer installment loan net charge offs increased to million this year from million in  with a net charge off ratio of in and in higher used automobile valuations benefited consumer installment recovery efforts  which increased to of average gross charge offs for the latest two years  compared to in and in consumer mortgage net charge offs increased in  and the net charge off ratio increased one basis point to 
home equity net charges offs increased to million in and the net charge off ratio increased six basis points to 
management continually evaluates the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan losses adequacy on a quarterly basis 
the two primary components of the loan review process that are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss allocations 
measurement of specific loan loss allocations is typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to repay 
impaired loans greater than million are evaluated for specific loan loss allocations 
consumer mortgages  consumer installment and home equity loans are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
the second component of the allowance establishment process  general loan loss allocations  is composed of two calculations that are computed on the five main loan segments business lending  consumer direct  consumer indirect  consumer mortgage and home equity 
the first calculation determines an allowance level based on the latest months of historical net charge off data for each loan category commercial loans exclude balances with specific loan loss allocations 
the second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration eight qualitative environmental factors levels and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  and other changes in lending policies  procedure  and practices  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
the allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined with unallocated allowances  if any  to derive the required allowance for loan losses to be reflected on the consolidated statement of condition 
as it has in prior periods  the company strives to refine and enhance its loss evaluation and estimation processes continually 
in  the company developed and utilized more granular historical loss factors on a portfolio specific basis  as well as enhanced its use of both company specific and macro economic qualitative factors 
these enhancements did not result in a significant change to the determined reserve levels 
the loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period allowance for loan losses  net of the interim period net charge offs  from the current required allowance level 
this provision is then recorded in the income statement for that period 
members of senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly 
management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management capabilities of the company and has dedicated the resources necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations 
acquired loans are recorded at acquisition date at their acquisition date fair values  and therefore  are excluded from the calculation of loans loss reserves as of the acquisition date 
to the extent there is a decrease in the present value of cash from the acquired impaired loans after the date of acquisition  the company records a provision for potential losses 
during the year ended december   the company established an allowance for loan losses for acquired impaired loans of million for estimated additional losses on certain acquired impaired loans 
in  an additional million of provision for loan losses related to the acquired impaired loans was recorded 
for acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition  credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value 
subsequent to the purchase date  the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans  however  the company records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance exceeds any remaining pooled discounts for loans evaluated collectively for impairment 
during the company recorded a provision for loan losses on acquired non impaired loans of million  of which million was recorded in the third quarter for loan pools acquired in the third quarter where the net fair value of the pool was deemed greater than its par value at acquisition 

the allowance for loan losses increased to million at year end from million at the end of the million increase was primarily due to the acquired non impaired loans 
the allowance for legacy loan losses remained stable as growth in the loan portfolio was offset by changes in the composition of the loan portfolio from higher risk commercial loans to lower risk consumer mortgage and consumer indirect loans 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased basis points to for year end as compared to for and for the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total legacy loans decreased basis points to for as compared to management believes the year end allowance for loan losses to be adequate in light of the probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision for legacy loans of million in increased by million as a result of management s assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio  as discussed above 
the loan loss provision as a percentage of average loans was in as compared to in and in the loan loss provision was of net charge offs this year versus in and in  reflective of the assessed risk in the portfolio 
the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates indicated  as well as the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
this allocation is based on management s assessment  as of a given point in time  of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes when the risk factors of each component part change 
the allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts of the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category 
table allowance for loan losses by loan type loan loan loan loan loan s omitted except for ratios allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix consumer mortgage business lending consumer installment indirect consumer installment direct home equity acquired impaired loans unallocated total as demonstrated in table above and discussed previously  business lending and consumer installment by their nature carries higher credit risk than residential real estate  and as a result these loans carry allowance for loan losses that cover a higher percentage of their total portfolio balances 
as in prior years  the unallocated allowance is maintained for inherent losses in the portfolio that is not reflected in the historical loss ratios  model imprecision  and for acquired loan portfolios in the process of being fully integrated at year end 
the unallocated allowance decreased from million in to million in the general declines in the unallocated portion of the allowance  as well as changes in year over year allowance allocations reflect management s continued refinement of its loss estimation techniques 
however  given the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance  management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the overall allowance for loan losses 
management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for loan losses to be prudent and reasonable 
furthermore  the company s allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan category 
funding sources the company utilizes a variety of funding sources to support the earning asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives 
overall funding is comprised of three primary sources that possess a variety of maturity  stability  and price characteristics deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  municipal deposits that are collateralized for amounts not covered by fdic insurance public funds and external borrowings 
the average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories are summarized below for the years indicated table average deposits average average average average average average s omitted  except rates balance rate paid balance rate paid balance rate paid noninterest checking deposits interest checking deposits regular savings deposits money market deposits time deposits total deposits as displayed in table above  total average deposits for equaled billion  up million or from the prior year 
excluding the impact of the hsbc  first niagara and wilber acquisitions  average deposits increased million or as compared to consistent with the company s focus on expanding core account relationships and reduced customer demand for time deposits  average non acquired  non time core deposit balances grew million or as compared to while time deposits balances were managed downward by million or 
this shift in mix also reflects the diminished rate differential between core and time deposits in the low interest rate environment 
average deposits in were up million or from  comprised of a million or increase in core deposits  and a million or increase in time deposits 
excluding the impact of the wilber acquisition  average deposits increased million or as compared to the company s funding composition continues to benefit from a high level of non public deposits  which reached an all time high in with an average balance of billion  an increase of million or over the comparable period 
excluding the impact of the hsbc  first niagara and wilber acquisitions  average non public deposits increased million or during non public  core deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and provide a strong customer base for which a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products can be sold 
full year average deposits of local municipalities increased million or during to million 
excluding the impact of the hsbc  first niagara and wilber acquisitions  average public deposits increased million or during municipal deposit balances tend to be more volatile than non public deposits because they are heavily impacted by the seasonality of tax collection and fiscal spending patterns  as well as the longer term financial position of the local government entities  which can change from year to year 
however  the company has many strong  long standing relationships with municipal entities throughout its markets and the diversified core deposits held by these customers has provided an attractive and comparatively stable funding source over an extended time period 
the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits in excess of fdic coverage with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  as well as the competitive bidding nature of municipal time deposits  management considers this funding source to be similar to external borrowings and thus prices these products on a consistent basis 
the mix of average deposits has been changing throughout the last several years 
the weighting of core interest checking  noninterest checking  savings and money market accounts has increased  while time deposits weighting decreased 
this change in deposit mix reflects the company s focus on expanding core account relationships and customers preference for unrestricted accounts in the current low rate environment 
the average balance for time deposit accounts decreased from of total average deposits for the fourth quarter of to of total average deposits for the fourth quarter of similarly  average core deposit balances have increased from in to in the fourth quarter of this shift in mix  combined with lower average interest rates in all interest bearing deposit product categories caused the cost of interest bearing deposits to decline to in  as compared to in and in the total cost of deposit funding including demand deposits also declined significantly in to  versus in  benefiting from the increase in non interest bearing checking average balances 
the remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of  or more outstanding as of december are as follows table time deposit  maturities s omitted less than three months three months to six months six months to one year over one year total external borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the fhlb of new york and federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the brokered cd and repurchase markets through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
the company also had approximately million in floating rate subordinated debt outstanding at the end of that is held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts 
in december  the company completed a sale of million of trust preferred securities 
the securities mature on december  and carry an annual rate equal to the three month libor rate plus 
the company used the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes including the early call of the million of fixed rate trust preferred securities 
at the time of the offering  the company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the variable rate trust preferred securities into a fixed rate obligation for a term of five years at a fixed rate of 
the interest rate swap matured in the fourth quarter of as shown in table  year end external borrowings totaled million  a decrease of million from  primarily the result of maturing fhlbny borrowings 
external borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for all of as compared to million or of total funding sources for this ratio remained consistent as the company used short term borrowings from the fhlb to fund the purchase of investment securities during the first half of as part of the pre investment of the anticipated liquidity coming from the branch acquisitions 
as displayed in table on page  the overall mix of funding in remained consistent with average fhlb borrowings and average deposits increased due to both acquired and organic growth 
the percentage of funding derived from deposits increased to in from in during average fhlb borrowings decreased slightly while average deposits increased

these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee 
these commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines 
standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party 
the credit risks associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit policies 
collateral may be obtained based on management s assessment of the customer s creditworthiness 
the fair value of these commitments is immaterial for disclosure 
the contract amount of these off balance sheet financial instruments as of december is as follows table off balance sheet financial instruments s omitted commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit total investments the objective of the company s investment portfolio is to hold low risk  high quality earning assets that provide favorable returns and provide another effective tool to actively manage its asset liability position in order to maximize future net interest income opportunities 
this must be accomplished within the following constraints a implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  b providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  c considering investment risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and d generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements 
the book value of the company s investment portfolio increased million to billion at year end during  the company purchased approximately million of us treasury securities and million of obligations of state and political subdivisions and other securities utilizing cash flows from deposit growth  maturing loans and investments and short term borrowings that were replaced with liquidity provided by the branch acquisitions in the third quarter 
in april  investments increased million from the wilber acquisition  primarily in government agency mortgage backed securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and us treasury and agency securities 
average investment balances including cash equivalents book value basis for increased million or versus the prior year driven by the branch acquisitions and deposit growth 
investment interest income fte basis in was million or higher than the prior year as a result of the higher average balances in the portfolio  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average investment yield from to 
during market interest rates continued to be low  and as a result  cash flows from maturing investments were reinvested at lower interest rates 
other than the pooled trust preferred securities discussed below  the investment portfolio has limited credit risk due to the composition continuing to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos and municipal bonds 
the us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs and us agency cmos are all aaa rated highest possible rating by moody s and aa by standard and poor s 
the majority of the municipal bonds are a rated or higher 
the portfolio does not include any private label mortgage backed securities mbss or private label collateralized mortgage obligations 
the overall mix of securities within the portfolio over the last year has changed  with an increase in the proportion of us treasury and agency securities and a decrease in the proportion of obligations of state and political subdivisions  government agency mortgage backed securities and other securities 
seventy four percent of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale at year end  versus at the end of due to the acquisition of hsbc and first niagara branches and wilber and the cash flows from maturing investments  both held to maturity and available for sale  being reinvested in available for sale securities 
the net pre tax market value gain over book value for the available for sale portfolio as of december  was million  up million from one year earlier 
this increase is indicative of the interest rate movements and changing spreads during the respective time periods and the changes in the size and composition of the portfolio 
although not reflected in the financial results of the company  the held to maturity portfolio had an additional million of net unrealized gains as of december  the following table sets forth the amortized cost and market value for the company investment securities portfolio table investment securities amortized amortized amortized cost book fair cost book fair cost book fair s omitted value value value value value value held to maturity portfolio us treasury and agency securities obligations of state and political subdivisions government agency mortgage backed securities corporate debt securities other securities total held to maturity portfolio available for sale portfolio us treasury and agency securities obligations of state and political subdivisions government agency mortgage backed securities pooled trust preferred securities government agency collateralized mortgage obligations corporate debt securities marketable equity securities available for sale portfolio net unrealized gain on available for sale portfolio total available for sale portfolio other securities federal home loan bank common stock federal reserve bank common stock other equity securities total other securities total included in the available for sale portfolio  as detailed in table  are pooled trust preferred  class a securities with a current par value of million and unrealized losses of million at december  the underlying collateral of these assets is principally trust preferred securities of smaller regional banks and insurance companies 
the company s securities are in the super senior cash flow tranche of the investment pools 
all other tranches in these pools will incur losses before this tranche is impacted 
an additional of the underlying collateral would have to be in deferral or default concurrently to result in the non receipt of contractual cash flows 
the market for these securities at december  is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active 
the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the fair value of these securities was determined by external pricing sources using a discounted cash flow model that incorporated market estimates of interest rates and volatility  as well as  observable quoted prices for similar assets in markets that have not been active 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on the reported fair values 
the use of different assumptions  as well as changes in market conditions  could result in materially different fair values 
a detailed review of the pooled trust preferred securities was completed at december  this review included an analysis of collateral reports  a cash flow analysis  including varying degrees of projected deferral default scenarios  and a review of various financial ratios of the underlying issuers 
based on the analysis performed  significant further deferral defaults and further erosion in other underlying performance conditions would have to exist before the company would incur a loss 
therefore  the company determined an other than temporary impairment did not exist at december  to date  the company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments and expects to fully collect all future contractual principal and interest payments 
the company does not intend to sell the underlying securities nor is it more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the securities 
these securities represent less than of the company s average earning assets for the year ending december  and  thus  are not relied upon for meeting the daily liquidity needs of the company 
subsequent changes in market or credit conditions could change these evaluations

impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates  prices or credit risk 
credit risk associated with the company s loan portfolio has been previously discussed in the asset quality section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the tax risk of the company municipal investments associated with potential future changes in statutory  judicial and regulatory actions is minimal 
other than the pooled trust preferred securities discussed beginning on page  the company has a minimal amount of credit risk in the remainder of its investment portfolio 
treasury  agency  mortgage backed and cmo securities issued by government agencies comprise of the total portfolio and are currently rated aaa by moody s investor services and aa by standard poor s 
municipal and corporate bonds excluding the pooled trust preferred securities consist of of the total portfolio  of which  carry a minimum rating of a 
the remaining of the portfolio covers local municipal bonds  other investment grade securities and pooled trust preferred securities 
the company does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure 
therefore  almost all the market risk in the investment portfolio is related to interest rates 
the ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity  in the short and long term time horizons is an important component of the company asset liability management process  which is governed by limits established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the policies to the asset liability management committee alco  which meets each month 
the committee is made up of the company senior management as well as regional and line of business managers who oversee specific earning asset classes and various funding sources 
asset liability management the primary objective of the company s asset liability management process is to maximize earnings and return on capital within acceptable levels of risk 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
the primary tools used by the company in managing interest rate risk are the income simulation model and economic value of equity modeling 
interest rate risk interest rate risk irr can result from the timing differences in the maturity repricing of an institution assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  and differences in the behavior of lending and funding rates  sometimes referred to as basis risk 
an example of basis risk would occur if floating rate assets and liabilities  with otherwise identical repricing characteristics  were based on market indexes that were imperfectly correlated 
given the potential types and differing related characteristics of irr  it is important that the company maintain an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify its primary sources of irr 
the company also recognizes that effective management of irr includes an understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the income statement 
accordingly  the company will manage its position so that it monitors its exposure to net interest income over both a one year planning horizon and a longer term strategic horizon 
it is the company s objective to manage its exposure to interest rate risk  but it should be understood that due to the nature of its business it will always be subject to rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may net interest margin be reduced 
income simulation income simulation is tested on a wide variety of balance sheet and treasury yield curve scenarios 
the simulation projects changes in net interest income  which are caused by the effect of changes in interest rates 
the model requires management to make assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from management outlook  as are the assumptions used for new loan yields and deposit rates 
loan prepayment speeds are projected based on a combination of current industry averages and internal historical prepayments 
balance sheet and yield curve assumptions are analyzed and reviewed by the alco regularly 
the following table reflects the company one year net interest income sensitivity  using december  asset and liability levels as a starting point 
the prime rate and federal funds rates are assumed to move up basis points over a month period while moving the treasury curve to spreads over federal funds that are more consistent with historical norms normalized yield curve 
in the basis point model  the prime and federal funds rates remain at current levels while moving the long end of the curve to levels over federal funds using spreads at a time when the yield curve was flat 
deposit rates are assumed to move in a manner that reflects the historical relationship between deposit rate movement and changes in the federal funds rate  generally reflecting of the movement of the federal funds rate 
cash flows are based on contractual maturity  optionality  amortization schedules and applicable prepayment assumptions derived from internal historical data and external sources 
net interest income sensitivity model calculated increase decrease in projected net income at december  changes in interest rates basis points basis points in the and models  the rising rate environment reflects an increase in net interest income nii from a flat rate environment 
the increase in a rising rate environment is largely a result of slower investment cash flows  a higher reinvestment rate of excess cash and assets repricing to higher rates 
partially offsetting the increased income  are higher deposit and borrowing costs 
over a longer time period the growth in nii improves significantly in a rising rate environment as lower yielding assets mature and are replaced at higher rates 
for the and models  the bank continues to show interest rate risk exposure if the yield curve flattens 
net interest income declines during the first twelve months as investment cash flows increase  partially offset by the slight increase of short term asset rates  as the intermediate points of the curve move to higher levels as the yield curve flattens 
corresponding deposit rates are assumed to remain constant 
despite fed funds trading near  the company believes long term treasury rates could potentially fall further in this scenario  and thus  the model tests the impact of this lower treasury rate scenario 
the analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and other factors 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
