overview we are a life sciences company that develops  manufactures and markets high value  consumable bioprocessing products for life sciences companies and biopharmaceutical manufacturing companies worldwide 
we are a world leading manufacturer of both native and recombinant forms of protein a  critical reagents used in biomanufacturing to separate and purify monoclonal antibodies  a type of biologic drug 
we also supply several growth factor products used to increase cell culture productivity during the biomanufacturing process 
in the burgeoning area of disposable biomanufacturing technologies  we have developed and currently market a series of opus open platform  user specified chromatography columns for use in clinical scale manufacturing 
these pre packed  plug and play columns are uniquely flexible and customizable to our customers media and size requirements 
we generally manufacture and sell protein a and growth factors to life sciences companies under long term supply agreements and sell our chromatography columns  as well as media and quality test kits  directly to biopharmaceutical companies or contract manufacturing organizations 
we refer to these activities as our bioprocessing business 
on december    we significantly increased the size of our bioprocessing business through a strategic acquisition 
we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of novozymes biopharma sweden  ab novozymes in lund  sweden  including the manufacture and supply of cell culture ingredients and protein a affinity ligands for use in industrial cell culture  stem and therapeutic cell culture and biopharmaceutical manufacturing the novozymes biopharma business and the acquisition of the novozymes biopharma business  the novozymes acquisition for a total upfront cash payment of million euros million 
as a result of the novozymes acquisition  we nearly doubled the size of our bioprocessing business 
historically  repligen also conducted activities aimed at developing proprietary therapeutic drug candidates  often with a potential of entering into a collaboration with a larger commercial stage pharmaceutical or biotechnology company in respect of these programs 
in addition  we have out licensed certain intellectual property to bristol myers squibb company  or bristol  from which we receive royalties on bristol s net sales in the united states of their product orencia 
as part of our strategic decision in to focus our efforts on our core bioprocessing business  we scaled back our efforts on our clinical development programs and increased our efforts to find collaboration partners to pursue the development and  if successful  commercialization of these drug programs 
the current status of our development portfolio is on december   we out licensed our sma program  led by rg  to pfizer inc  or pfizer 
pursuant to this license agreement  pfizer will assume the majority of the costs associated with 
table of contents completing the required clinical trials for this program as well as obtaining us food and drug administration fda approval of the respective new drug application nda 
under the license agreement  we are obligated to conduct additional activities in support of this program  which will include completing the second cohort of the current phase i trial and supporting the transition of the program to pfizer 
we expect to complete these activities in the first half of the most advanced product candidate in our development portfolio is rg  a synthetic human hormone being developed as a novel imaging agent for the improved detection of pancreatic duct abnormalities in combination with magnetic resonance imaging in patients with pancreatitis and potentially other pancreatic diseases 
we submitted an nda to the fda and a marketing authorization application maa to the european medicines agency ema in the first quarter of in the second quarter of  we received a complete response letter from the fda  indicating the need for additional clinical efficacy and safety trial data 
we are currently working with the fda on the details of an additional phase iii trial 
we believe providing certainty as to the requirements of this additional phase iii trial may be an important factor in the decision by third parties that may wish to pursue a development or commercialization agreement with us for rg our third clinical development program was targeted at friedrich s ataxia and led by rg  a class i histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor 
rg has received orphan drug designation from the fda and european commission 
we initiated a single  ascending dose phase study of rg in friedreich s ataxia patients in italy in the fourth quarter of and expect to complete this trial in the first half of we believe the results of this trial may be an important consideration for any third party that may wish to pursue a development or commercialization agreement with us for rg we expect that any additional development activities that we may pursue in the future will be largely supported by sponsors or collaborators 
on april   we entered into a settlement agreement with bristol in connection with a patent infringement lawsuit we filed against bristol 
under the terms of the agreement  bristol is obligated to pay us royalties on its us net sales of orencia for any clinical indication at a rate of for the first  of annual sales  for the next  of annual sales and of annual sales in excess of billion 
under the terms of the agreement  we will not receive any future royalties on bristol s sales of orencia made after december  total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  increased as compared to the nine month fiscal year ended december  and is primarily due to the acquisition of the novozymes business as well as increased royalty revenue from bristol as their product orencia continues to penetrate the market 
critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements  we have identified the policies and estimates below as being critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  including in the results of operations section  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition product sales we generate revenue from the sale of products  licensing transactions and research and development collaborations 
our product revenues are from the sale of bioprocessing products to customers in the life science and biopharmaceutical industries 
we recognize revenue related to product sales upon delivery of the product to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
determination of whether these criteria have been 
table of contents met are based on management s judgments primarily regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for the product delivered and the collectability of those fees 
we have a few longstanding customers who comprise the majority of revenue and have excellent payment histories and therefore we do not require collateral 
we have had no significant write offs of uncollectible invoices in the periods presented 
at the time of sale  we also evaluate the need to accrue for warranty and sales returns 
the supply agreements we have with our customers and related purchase orders identify the terms and conditions of each sale and the price of the goods ordered 
due to the nature of the sales arrangements  inventory produced for sale is tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
since the product is manufactured to order and in compliance with required specifications prior to shipment  the likelihood of sales return  warranty or other issues is largely diminished 
sales returns and warranty issues are infrequent and have had nominal impact on our financial statements historically 
orencia royalty in april  we settled our outstanding litigation with bristol and began recognizing royalty revenue from that settlement in fiscal year for bristol s net sales in the united states of orencia  which is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
pursuant to the settlement with bristol  we recognized royalty revenue of  for the fiscal year ended december    for the nine month fiscal year ended december  and  for the fiscal year ended march  revenue earned from bristol royalties is recorded in the periods when it is earned based on royalty reports sent by bristol to us 
we have no continuing obligations to bristol as a result of this settlement 
our royalty agreement with bristol provides that we will receive such royalty payments on sales of orencia by bristol through december  pfizer license agreement in december  we entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement the license agreement with pfizer to advance the sma program  which is led by rg and also includes backup compounds and enabling technologies 
pursuant to the terms of the license agreement  we received million from pfizer as an upfront payment on january  and are entitled to receive up to million in potential future payments  a portion of which may be owed to third parties 
these potential payments are approximately equally divided between milestones related to clinical development and initial commercial sales in specific geographies 
in addition  we are entitled to receive royalties on any future sales of rg or any sma compounds developed under the license agreement 
the royalty rates are tiered and begin in the high single digits for rg or lesser amounts for any backup compounds developed under the license agreement 
our receipt of these royalties is subject to an obligation under an existing in license agreement and other customary offsets and deductions 
there are no refund provisions in this agreement 
activities under this agreement were evaluated in accordance with asc to determine if they represented a multiple element revenue arrangement 
we identified the following deliverables in the pfizer agreement an exclusive license to research  develop  manufacture  commercialize and use rg and backup compounds for the treatment of sma and other disorders the license  research and development services designed to transition the sma program to pfizer pursuant to a transition plan the transition services  the completion of the second cohort of a phase i clinical trial that was underway at the time the license agreement was signed  and an inventory of rg  that could be used in clinical development  specifically to complete the phase i clinical trial  referenced immediately above the clinical trial material 
two criteria must be met in order for a deliverable to be considered a separate unit of accounting 
the first criterion requires that the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
the second 
table of contents criterion  which relates to evaluating a general right of return  is not applicable because such a provision does not exist in the license agreement 
the deliverables outlined above were deemed to have stand alone value and to meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate units of accounting 
factors considered in this determination included  among other things  whether any other vendors sell the items separately and if pfizer could use the delivered item for its intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining deliverables 
if multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separable into different units of accounting  the multiple element arrangements guidance addresses how to allocate the arrangement consideration to those units of accounting 
the amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to the identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price 
we identified the arrangement consideration to allocate among the units of accounting as the million non refundable up front payment and excluded the potential milestone payments provided for in the license agreement from the arrangement consideration as they were not considered fixed or determinable at the time the license agreement was signed 
because we had not sold these items on a standalone basis previously  we had no vendor specific objective evidence of selling price 
furthermore  we did not have detailed third party evidence of selling price  and as a result we used our best estimate of selling price for each item 
in determining these prices  we considered what we would be willing to sell the items for on a standalone basis  what the market would bear for such items and what another party might charge for these items 
the up front arrangement consideration allocated to the license was recognized upon delivery of the license as the risks and rewards associated with the license transferred at that time 
we used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the value of the license 
key assumptions in the analysis included the estimated market size for a compound targeted at sma  the estimated remaining costs of development and time to commercialization  and the probability of successfully developing and commercializing the program 
based on this analysis  we allocated  to the value of the license and recognized this amount as revenue in the fiscal year ended december  the remaining  of value was allocated based on the following the estimated selling price of the transition services was approximately  resulting in consideration allocation of approximately  we were able to derive a price for these services  in part because they are similar to services provided by a contract research organization 
we based the selling price of the transition services on internal full time equivalent personnel costs and external costs that we expect to incur to transition the program to pfizer 
we applied a mark up on the internal full time equivalent personnel costs consistent with that of contract research organizations 
the estimated selling price of the completion of the second cohort of the clinical trial was approximately  resulting in consideration allocation of approximately  this estimated selling price is based on the estimated  remaining costs to complete this cohort 
since the costs are pursuant to an arrangement negotiated with a third party clinical site  we believe that the external cost estimate included in the agreement represents the best estimate of selling price for this unit of accounting 
the estimated selling price of the clinical trial material was approximately  resulting in consideration allocation of approximately  the estimated selling price is based upon the cost of procuring such material from the contract manufacturing organization that made the material 
since these costs were incurred pursuant to an arrangement negotiated with a third party contract manufacturing organization  we believes that the costs included in the agreement represents the best estimate of selling price for this unit of accounting 
we believe that a change in the key assumptions used to determine best estimate of selling price for each of the deliverables would not have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration 

table of contents we intend to recognize the revenues related to the transfer of clinical trial material upon transfer of title and risk of loss to pfizer  which we expect to occur in the first half of we expect to recognize revenues related to the transition services and the completion of the second cohort ratably over the first six months of future milestone payments  if any  under the license agreement will be recognized under the provisions of asc  which was adopted by repligen on january  asc allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to recognize a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is considered an event if it can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the company s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the company s performance  there is substantive uncertainty at the date an arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved  and it would result in additional payments being due to the entity 
in addition to the million up front payment  we are also eligible to receive million in potential milestone payments from pfizer comprised of up to million related to the achievement of specified clinical milestone events  and up to million related to the achievement of specified commercial sales events  specifically the first commercial sale in specific territories 
we believe that the million of specified clinical milestone payments are substantive 
we may receive all  or a portion of  the first clinical milestone of million in depending upon the development path chosen by pfizer 
if we receive a portion of this milestone  we expect to receive the balance of it by the end of any milestones earned upon specified commercial sales events or future royalty payments  under the license agreement will be recognized as revenue when they are earned 
research and development agreements in the fiscal year ended december   we also recognized  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the national institutes of health scripps research institute  the european friedrich s ataxia consortium for translational studies  gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
for the nine month fiscal year ended december   we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  the european friedrich s ataxia consortium for translational studies  go friedreich s ataxia research gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
for the nine months ended december   we recognized  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
in the fiscal year ended march   we also recognized approximately  in one time grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  which was created in march as part of the patient protection and affordability care act 
research revenue is recognized when the expense has been incurred and services have been performed 
determination of which incurred costs qualify for reimbursement under the terms of our contractual agreements 
table of contents and the timing of when such costs were incurred involves the judgment of management 
our calculations are based upon the agreed upon terms as stated in the arrangements 
however  should the estimated calculations change or be challenged by other parties to the agreements  research revenue may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
the calculations have not historically changed or been challenged  and we do not anticipate any significant subsequent change in revenue related to sponsored research and development projects 
there have been no material changes to our initial estimates related to revenue recognition in any periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories relate to our bioprocessing business 
we value inventory at cost or  if lower  fair market value  using the first in  first out method 
we review our inventory at least quarterly and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on our estimates of expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates of raw materials  work in process and finished products 
expected sales volumes are determined based on supply forecasts provided by key customers for the next three to months 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  and inventory in excess of expected requirements to cost of product revenue 
manufacturing of bioprocessing finished goods is done to order and tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
a change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory quantities on hand 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or unexpected quality failures could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and reported operating results 
during all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  there have been no material adjustments related to a revised estimate of inventory valuations 
business combinations amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  if any  based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions determined by management 
any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
the fair value of contingent consideration includes estimates and judgments made by management regarding the probability that future contingent payments will be made  the extent of royalties to be earned in excess of the defined minimum royalties  etc 
management updates these estimates and the related fair value of contingent consideration at each reporting period 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in our statement of operations 
we use the income approach to determine the fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets including customer relationships and developed technology 
this approach determines fair value by estimating after tax cash flows attributable to these assets over their respective useful lives and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our assumptions on estimates of future cash flows  expected growth rates  expected trends in technology  etc 
we base the discount rates used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and certain industry specific risk factors 
we believe the estimated purchased customer relationships and developed technology amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the assets 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using the straight line method 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we review our intangible assets subject to 
table of contents amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing fair value  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is the last day of our fiscal fourth quarter 
for the fiscal year ended december   the impairment test date was december  accrued liabilities we estimate accrued liabilities by identifying services performed on our behalf  estimating the level of service performed and determining the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
these expenses are normally determined through a contract or purchase order issued by us  service fees paid to organizations for their performance in conducting clinical trials 
these expenses are determined by contracts in place for those services and communications with project managers on costs that have been incurred as of each reporting date  and professional and consulting fees incurred with law firms  audit and accounting service providers and other third party consultants 
these expenses are determined by either requesting those service providers to estimate unbilled services at each reporting date for services incurred or tracking costs incurred by service providers under fixed fee arrangements 
we have processes in place to estimate the appropriate amounts to record for accrued liabilities  which principally involve the applicable personnel reviewing the services provided 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  the reported expenses for that period may be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services often require the exercise of judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known at the date of the financial statements 
a change in the estimated cost or volume of services provided could result in additional accrued liabilities 
any significant unanticipated changes in such estimates could have a significant impact on our accrued liabilities and reported operating results 
there have been no material adjustments to our accrued liabilities in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards on the grant date 

table of contents the expected term of options granted represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from our historical stock option exercise experience and option expiration data 
accordingly  the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
in addition  for purposes of estimating the expected term  we have aggregated all individual option awards into one group as we do not expect substantial differences in exercise behavior among our employees 
the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of options granted 
we determined the expected volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term  exclusive of any events not reasonably anticipated to recur over the option s expected term 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the option s expected term on the grant date 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our capital stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period based upon options that are ultimately expected to vest  and accordingly  such compensation expense has been adjusted by an amount of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered option 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on an analysis of historical data  we have calculated an annual forfeiture rate for non executive level employees  a annual forfeiture rate for executive level employees  and a forfeiture rate for non employee members of the board of directors  which we believe is a reasonable assumption to estimate forfeitures 
however  the estimation of forfeitures requires significant judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  for the nine month fiscal year ended december  and the nine month period ended december   we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  and  respectively  for stock options granted under the second amended and restated repligen corporation stock plan the plan 
for the fiscal year ended march   we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  for stock options granted under the plan 
as of december   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based awards 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining requisite service period of years 
we expect  unvested options to vest over the next five years 
income taxes as of september   our us net operating losses nol s and other deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance primarily because we were in a cumulative loss position and did not have sufficient history of income to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the tax benefits of those deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a three year cumulative pre tax income position and concluded that it was more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in based on our projections to realize the tax benefit of a portion of our deferred tax assets 
as such  we reversed  of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the u 
s in the fourth quarter of the amount is recorded as a benefit for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
as a result of the fact that we will no longer receive royalty payments on bristol s sales of orencia after december   we concluded that realization of deferred tax assets beyond december  is not more likely than not  and as such  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets estimated to reverse beyond in supporting our conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would realize the tax benefits of certain of our deferred tax assets  we weighed the positive and negative evidence 
the positive evidence included that 
table of contents fact that we had entered into a cumulative three year pre tax income position in the us and were projecting significant pre tax income in the us in the year ending december   we have a history of operating within our projections  and the fact that a significant portion of our bioprocessing revenue and royalty payments on us sales of orencia are reasonably predictable due to our long term supply agreements with certain customers and the fact that us sales of orencia have been increasing on a quarterly basis for several years 
our projections include estimates and assumptions as it relates to projected revenues and costs to be incurred 
we believe that our projections are reasonable and supportable 
our projections also reflect significant planned reductions in research and development expenses associated with our therapeutic product candidates  as discussed elsewhere in this form k 
we believe that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence  which included that fact that we were in a three year cumulative loss position prior to the fourth quarter of and the fact that our projections for the year ending december  and beyond are significantly impacted by the fact that after december  we no longer receive royalty payments from bristol on us sales of orencia 
results of operations on december   we changed our fiscal year end from march to december as a result of this change  we filed a transition report on form k covering the nine month transition period ending december  as a result of this change  fiscal refers to the twelve month period from january  through december  fiscal refers to the nine month transition period from april  through december  fiscal refers to the unaudited nine month period from april  through december  the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto

in thousands  except percentages bioprocessing product revenue royalty and other revenue total revenue substantially all of our bioprocessing products are based on recombinant protein a and are sold to customers who incorporate our manufactured products into their proprietary antibody purification systems to be sold directly to the pharmaceutical industry 
monoclonal antibodies are a well established class of drug with applications in rheumatoid arthritis  asthma and a variety of cancers 
sales of our bioprocessing products are therefore impacted by the timing of large scale production orders and the regulatory approvals for such antibodies  which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations 
for fiscal  bioprocessing product sales increased by  or as compared to fiscal driven predominantly by the acquisition of the novozymes business which contributed  in revenue  the longer fiscal period in fiscal and increased demand from certain key customers 
we sell our assorted bioprocessing products at various price points 
the mix of products sold varies and impacts the fluctuations in total product revenue and cost of product revenues from period to period 

table of contents for fiscal  bioprocessing product sales increased by  or as compared to fiscal volume increased due to increased demand from certain key customers and other business events  and was offset by a decrease in sales revenue due to changes in the mix of products sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal pursuant to the settlement with bristol  we recognized royalty revenue of  for fiscal as well as  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
for the year ending december   we expect royalty revenues to increase moderately over the prior year as bristol s orencia continues to penetrate the market 
the royalty arrangement with bristol expires on december  for fiscal  we recognized  of revenue from the out license of our spinal muscular atrophy program to pfizer on december  in fiscal  we also recognized  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the national institutes of health scripps research institute  the european friedrich s ataxia consortium for translational studies  gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance

table of contents gross margins were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
during the current year  the company began an extensive cost reduction initiative of both the sweden and waltham facilities 
as a result of these efforts  we anticipate that gross margins will improve in the year ending december  pursuant to the settlement with bristol  we must remit of royalty revenue received through the expiration of the agreement in december to the university of michigan 
for the fiscal years  and  cost of royalty revenue was   and  respectively 
these increases are directly related to the increases in bristol royalty revenues noted above 
research and development costs represent bioprocessing product and therapeutic drug development and primarily include costs of internal personnel  supplies  external pharmacology and toxicology research  clinical trials and the costs associated with the manufacturing and testing of clinical materials 
in august   we announced a strategic focus on our bioprocessing business and a simultaneous effort to find partners  out licensing opportunities or other funding arrangements with external parties to reduce or eliminate the net expenditures on research and development activities for our therapeutic programs 
those efforts are ongoing 
in december  we announced that we entered into an outlicensing agreement with pfizer  inc for our spinal muscular atrophy program  under an arrangement that would provide million up front and up to million in future milestones  plus royalties 
in june  we received a complete response letter from the nda on our nda for secreflo for pancreatic imaging indicating that additional clinical data would be required to support potential approval in the united states 
we simultaneously withdrew our maa for secreflo from consideration by the ema 
we believe that secreflo  if approved  would provide a safe and effective means to non invasively image the pancreas with mri and will meet an important unmet medical need for patients with pancreatitis 
however  given the shift in strategic focus towards bioprocessing product sales  we are seeking partners to either out license or fund the development of this program and as such do not anticipate incurring material expenditures under this program without entering into such arrangements 
in addition  we are performing phase clinical study of rg in patients with friedreich s ataxia 
we receive funding from a number of sponsors on this program that significantly mitigates the net expense of the programs and we are pursuing the clinical trial and other key program objectives that will enable the recognition of revenues under these sponsored research agreements and with the goal of making the program more viable from a partnering or out licensing perspective 
due to the small size of the company and the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs  we do not track all of our expenses or allocate any fixed costs by program  and therefore  have not provided an estimate of historical costs incurred by project 
each of our therapeutic research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals that are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research programs  particularly in our early stage programs must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
for example  results from our preclinical animal models may not be replicated in our clinical trials with humans 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion dates of these programs 
these risks and uncertainties generally prevent us from estimating with any certainty the specific timing and future costs of our research and development programs  although historical trends within the industry suggest that gross expenses tend to increase in later stages of development 
as mentioned above  however  we anticipate entering into partnering  outlicensing or other such arrangements in the coming year  similar to the pfizer license  
table of contents in order to fund those gross expenditures 
arrangements with commercial vendors and academic researchers accounted for  and of our research and development expenses for fiscal  and  respectively 
the outsourcing of such services provides us flexibility to discontinue or increase spending depending on the success of our research and development programs 
for fiscal  research and development expenses increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is comprised primarily of a  increase in bioprocessing process development costs due to the novozymes acquisition and  of severance and related expenses associated with the shift towards bioprocessing and a longer fiscal period in versus for fiscal  research and development expenses increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is comprised primarily of a  increase in costs associated with drug product manufacturing and other costs associated with the nda submission for secreflo for mri imaging of the pancreas  offset by a  settlement related to this program from a dispute with parexel international corporation  the parent company of perceptive informatics  inc and a  increase related to rg for spinal muscular atrophy  which includes a  milestone payment made in april upon successful filing of our investigational new drug application with the fda  as well as other costs associated with the initiation of our phase clinical trial 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease related to rg for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder as we discontinued this program in march and a  decrease related to our friedreich s ataxia program as we incurred higher costs in the prior period related to testing and drug substance manufacture in preparation for our upcoming phase study of rg in adult patients with friedreich s ataxia in europe 
future research and development expenses are dependent on a number of variables  including the cost and design of clinical trials and external costs such as manufacturing of clinical materials as well as the availability of external funding to support those programs 
we expect our research and development expenses in the year ending december  to decrease significantly now that the spinal muscular atrophy program was licensed to pfizer and we focus our therapeutics efforts on finding partners to fund or out license the secreflo and friedreich s ataxia programs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include the costs associated with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our research and development efforts  including legal  accounting  patent  shareholder services  amortization of intangible assets and other administrative functions 
in addition  sg a expenses have historically included costs associated with various litigation matters 
for fiscal  sg a costs increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily comprised of an incremental  in sg a from our newly acquired swedish subsidiary  approximately  which represents an additional quarter of our traditional us operations as fiscal was a longer fiscal period than fiscal  and other miscellaneous expenses 
for fiscal  sg a costs increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily comprised of approximately  in transaction costs related to the novozymes acquisition   related to commercialization efforts as we prepared to launch secreflo for mri imaging of the pancreas  pending fda approval   due to headcount increases in marketing and business development  including salaries  stock based compensation and recruiting costs   related to business development activities  and  due to increased development and sales and marketing activities related to our opus product 
we expect sg a expenses to decrease slightly in the year ending december  primarily because we do not expect a recurrence of the deal costs associated with the novozymes acquisition that we incurred in in addition  the prior year included certain marketing research expenditures associated with the anticipated approval of secreflo that have been eliminated going forward upon receipt of the complete response letter

investment income for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
the increase of  or for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to slightly higher interest rates after an unusually low fiscal and a longer period in fiscal the decrease of  or for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and a shorter period in fiscal we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates 
benefit from provision for income taxes in the year ended december   we recorded a tax benefit of  that is comprised of the reversal of  of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets offset by a provision for a state tax liability

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities  revenues derived from product sales  and research grants  as well as proceeds and royalties from license arrangements and a litigation settlement 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to our bioprocessing product revenue  royalties from bristol s sales of orencia through december   and research and development grants 
given the uncertainties related to pharmaceutical product development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our therapeutic product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows

financing activities exercises of stock options provided cash receipts of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in  there were no stock option exercises 
during fiscal  the repurchase of common stock consumed  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following fixed obligations and commitments payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations contingent consideration total primarily represents purchase orders for the procurement of raw material for manufacturing 
these contingent consideration amounts relating to acquisitions are recorded in accrued expenses and long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the expansion of our bioprocessing business  the ability to sustain sales and profits of our bioprocessing products  the resources required to successfully integrate the novozymes biopharma business and recognize expected synergies  our ability to establish one or more partnerships for development and commercialization of rg or our early stage cns programs  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  our ability to acquire additional bioprocessing products or product candidates  the extent of any share repurchase activity  the success of any proposed financing efforts  and the amount of royalty revenues we receive from bristol through december  absent acquisitions of additional products  product candidates or intellectual property  we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next months 
we expect operating expenses in the year ending december  to decrease significantly as we invest less in therapeutic drug development and simultaneously improve gross margins through greater optimization of our two production facilities and other process improvements we have developed internally 
we expect to incur continued spending related to the development and expansion of our bioprocessing product lines for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements may include  but are not limited to  expansion of our waltham facility and other purchases of property  plant and equipment  the acquisition of additional bioprocessing products and technologies to complement our existing manufacturing capabilities  and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio 
we plan to continue to invest in our bioprocessing business and in key research and development activities associated with our efforts to identify and consummate development and commercialization partnerships 
we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis  including monetizing existing assets and licensing or acquiring complementary products  technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio of development programs 
we continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders 
in order to acquire such assets  we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments 
this may require the issuance or sale of additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
should we need to secure additional financing to acquire a product  fund future investment in research and development  or meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and business tax credits carryforwards of approximately  available to reduce future federal income taxes  if any 
the net operating loss and business tax credits carryforwards will continue to expire at various dates through december net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders 

table of contents foreign earnings at december   we have not provided for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on outside basis differences of foreign subsidiaries of approximately  as we have the ability and intend to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of repligen sweden and there are no needs for such earnings in the us that would contradict our plan to indefinitely reinvest 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have investments in commercial paper  us government and agency securities as well as corporate bonds and other debt securities 
as a result  we are exposed to potential loss from market risks that may occur as a result of changes in interest rates  changes in credit quality of the issuer or otherwise 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  we believe  however  that the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure  and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer with the exception of us agency obligations and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited 
foreign exchange risk transactions by our subsidiary  repligen sweden  may be denominated in swedish kronor  british pound sterling  us dollars  or in euros while the entity s functional currency is the swedish krona 
exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation between the transactional currency and the functional currency of repligen sweden are included in our consolidated statements of operations 
the functional currency of the company is us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we currently do not seek to hedge this exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
although a majority of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  and of total revenues during fiscal and  respectively  were denominated in foreign currencies while and of our costs and expenses during fiscal and  respectively  were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily operating expenses associated with cost of revenue  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
in addition  and of our consolidated tangible assets were subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations as of each of december  and  respectively  while and of our consolidated liabilities were exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctuations as of each of december  and  respectively
