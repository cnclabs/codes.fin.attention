item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information is provided in connection with  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we operate on a fiscal year ending on april the following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended april  overview we are a self advised equity real estate investment trust engaged in owning and operating income producing real properties 
our investments include multi family residential properties and commercial properties located primarily in the upper midwest states of minnesota and north dakota 
our properties are diversified in property type and location 
as of april   our real estate portfolio consisted of multi family residential properties containing  apartment units and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and commercial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of billion 
our primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multi family residential and commercial leases 
our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy 
this strategy is focused on growing assets in desired geographical markets  achieving diversification by property type and location  and adhering to targeted returns in acquiring properties 
we have paid quarterly distributions continuously since our first distribution in critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
real estate 
real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  less an adjustment for impairment  if any 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
as described further below  the process of allocating property costs to its components involves a considerable amount of subjective judgments to be made by company management 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company uses a year estimated life for buildings and improvements and a year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and improvements that improve and or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life  generally five to ten years 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible assets including land  buildings and personal property  which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and considers whether there were significant intangible assets acquired for example  above and below market leases  the value of acquired in place leases  and tenant relationships and assumed liabilities  and allocates the purchase price based on these assessments 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land  buildings  and personal property based on management determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and reference to recent sales of comparable properties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately  or based on a relative fair value allocation if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based upon the company evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases 
factors considered in the fair value analysis include an estimate of carrying costs and foregone rental income during hypothetical expected lease up periods  considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the company also considers information about each property obtained during its pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the company follows the real estate project costs guidance in asc  real estate general  in accounting for the costs of development and re development projects 
as real estate is undergoing development or redevelopment  all project costs directly associated with and attributable to the development and construction of a project  including interest expense and real estate tax expense  are capitalized to the cost of the real property 
the capitalization period begins when development activities and expenditures begin and ends upon completion  which is when the asset is ready for its intended use 
generally  rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements in the case of commercial properties or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy in the case of multi family residential properties 
general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration is received by the company and the company has no significant continuing involvement with the property sold 
real estate held for sale 
real estate held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs 
depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale 
the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet requires management to make certain significant judgments 
the company makes a determination as to the point in time that it is probable that a sale will be consummated 
it is not unusual for real estate sales contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract 
in addition  certain other matters critical to the final sale  such as financing arrangements  often remain pending even upon contract acceptance 
as a result  properties under contract may not close within the expected time period  or may not close at all 
due to these uncertainties  it is not likely that the company can meet the criteria of the current accounting principles governing the classification of properties as held for sale prior to a sale formally closing 
therefore  any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to close within the requirements set forth in current accounting principles 
the company reports  in discontinued operations  the results of operations and the related gains or losses of a property that has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and otherwise meets the classification of a discontinued operation 
impairment 
the company long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when and if events or changes in circumstances or triggering events such as adverse market conditions  including conditions resulting from an ongoing economic recession indicate that the cost of a long lived asset might not be recoverable 
judgments regarding existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions  expected holding period of each asset and events that occur that affect the financial strength of significant tenants of the assets  including tenants who have filed for bankruptcy 
for long lived assets in which a triggering event has been identified  the company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long lived asset against the carrying amount of the asset  including any associated intangibles  subject to evaluation 
the evaluation of undiscounted cash flows is subjective and reflects assumptions regarding current market conditions relative to the long lived asset being evaluated  such as future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
a worsening real estate market may cause the company to re evaluate the assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
if the undiscounted cash flows plus reversion are less than the asset carrying value  impairment is recorded based on the estimated fair value typically based on a current independent appraisal of the long lived asset in comparison to its carrying value 
the results of the company evaluation of impairment analysis could be material to the company financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts approximately  as of april  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements 
the company also maintains an allowance for deferred rents receivable arising from the straight lining of rents approximately  as of april  and from mortgage loans as of april  
the straight lining of rents receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
if estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent increases and abated rent under the leases 
certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
rental revenue is recorded for the full term of each lease on a straight line basis 
accordingly  the company records a receivable from tenants for rents that it expects to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable 
when the company acquires a property  the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation 
revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluation of the reliability of such deferred rents receivable involves management assumptions relating to such tenant viability 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
expense reimbursement income revenue arising from tenant leases  which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
income taxes 
the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a reit under sections of the internal revenue code 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to its shareholders of its taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  it would fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result 
the company taxable income is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following that the company tenants perform their obligations under their leases with the company and that the company tax and accounting positions do not change 
these factors  which impact the company taxable income  are subject to change  and many are outside the control of the company 
if actual results vary  the company taxable income may change

fiscal significant events and transactions during fiscal year  the company successfully completed various acquisition  development  disposition  financing and capital raising transactions  including the following significant activities acquisitions  dispositions  and development projects placed in service during fiscal year  the company added approximately  apartment units to its multi family residential portfolio during fiscal year  through its acquisition of five multi family residential properties and the placement in service of three multi family residential development projects  and sold three multi family properties in fargo  north dakota  with a total of units  for a net addition to the company multi family residential portfolio in fiscal year of approximately  apartment units 
additional development projects placed in service during fiscal year were a medical office building in jamestown  north dakota  an expansion of the company senior housing project in laramie  wyoming  an industrial building in minot  north dakota  and a branch bank building in minot  north dakota 
the company also acquired a number of parcels of unimproved land in north dakota and minnesota for possible future development  for purchase prices totaling approximately million 
during fiscal year  in addition to its sale of three multi family residential projects in fargo  north dakota  the company also disposed of a small retail property in kentwood  michigan  four condominium units in its georgetown square project in grand chute  wisconsin  and a healthcare property in stevens point  wisconsin 
annual report development projects in process during fiscal year  the company began construction of its unit river ridge apartments project in bismarck  north dakota and of its unit cypress court apartment homes project in st 
cloud  minnesota  of which the company owns approximately  with the remaining owned by the company joint venture partner 
the company also acquired an approximately interest in a joint venture entity constructing the southgate apartments project in minot  north dakota 
common share offering in april  the company completed a public offering of approximately million common shares at a public offering price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses 
preferred share offering the company completed  in august  a public offering of million series b preferred shares  for net proceeds of approximately million  after underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses 
credit facility and term loan transactions during fiscal year  the company executed an amendment to the company multi bank line of credit  to lower the floor on the interest rate to per annum and to change the interest rate under the loan agreement to the prime rate plus 
additionally  in march  a joint venture entity in which the company owns a interest entered into a construction and term loan agreement in the maximum principal amount of approximately to construct a multi family apartment facility in williston  north dakota the company renaissance heights project 
the construction and term loan has a maturity date of october   and is secured in part by a first mortgage on the project and by the guaranty of the company operating partnership 
transfer of stock exchange listing in december  the company transferred the listing of its common and preferred shares to the new york stock exchange from the nasdaq global select market 
market conditions and outlook during the company fiscal year  real estate operating fundamentals continued to improve  particularly in the company multi family residential segment 
high occupancy levels in its multi family residential portfolio allowed the company to implement selected rent increases  and the company three multi family residential development projects placed in service during the year the company quarry ridge ii project in rochester  minnesota  buildings and of the company four building williston garden project in williston  north dakota  and the company unit first avenue project in minot  north dakota leased up quickly  with quarry ridge leased as of april   the four buildings of the williston garden project leased as of april   and the first avenue project leased as of april  the company expects to see continued favorable results in this segment in fiscal year  however  the company ability to maintain occupancy levels and selectively raise rents remains dependent on continued economic recovery and employment and wage growth 
the company also observes considerable multi family development activity in the company markets  and as this new construction is completed and leased  the company will experience increased competition for tenants 
the company commercial office segment  while still negatively affected by a number of adverse macro conditions  including unemployment levels that remain elevated and stagnant wage growth  also showed some progress  with new leasing activity matching absorption rates in the company minneapolis market and in other of its office markets 
however  these absorption rates remain low  and businesses  in a continued focus on costs  appear to be increasing the density of their work spaces by placing more employees in less total square footage and giving back the excess space or downsizing upon lease renewals 
the company continues to expect recovery of the overall office market to be challenged by the slow and uneven recovery of the broader economy and by relatively high unemployment rates 
the company healthcare segment consists of medical office properties and senior housing facilities 
the medical office sector remains stable with modest increases in both occupancy and rents  as the uncertainty of healthcare reform is replaced with implementation and the corresponding expected increase in healthcare utilization  as previously uninsured patients enter the traditional medical services system 
likewise  senior housing assets continue to benefit from a recovery of the housing market  as occupancy trends are closely aligned with the ability of seniors to sell their homes in anticipation of moving to a senior care facility 
both the retail and industrial property markets are showing signs of revival 
in the retail segment  better located retail properties are enjoying more leasing success  while outlying shopping centers continue to experience higher vacancy rates 
in the industrial segment  a relative lack of new supply is leading to vacant industrial space being absorbed 
industrial rents are not yet rising to reflect this lack of new supply  but tenant concessions appear to be dissipating 
the company plans to continue in fiscal year its selective disposition of assets in non core markets  particularly industrial and retail segment assets  and intends to use the proceeds from these dispositions to continue deleveraging its portfolio and for developing and acquiring high quality assets in its multi family and healthcare segments 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  on may   the company sold four industrial properties in minnesota and north dakota  for a total sales price of approximately million  and a smaller retail property for a sale price of approximately million 
also subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the company has signed agreements to sell four industrial properties in minnesota and iowa  and three office properties in minnesota 
these pending dispositions are subject to various contingencies  and no assurances can be given that these sales transactions will be completed 
the company continues to allocate resources to the dynamic economy of the energy rich bakken shale formation region of eastern montana  western and central north dakota  northwest south dakota and western minnesota 
development projects currently scheduled for completion in fiscal years and in this region include the company unit river ridge apartment project in bismarck  north dakota  the unit landing at southgate and unit commons at southgate apartment projects in minot  north dakota  in which the company has a interest  and the unit renaissance heights phase i apartment project in williston  north dakota  in which the company has a interest 
energy activity in the bakken shale region continues to be robust  and the company expects this activity to remain strong in the next several years 
stabilized and non stabilized properties throughout this annual report on form k  we have provided certain information on a stabilized and non stabilized properties basis 
information provided on a stabilized properties basis includes the results of properties that we have owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared  and properties classified as discontinued operations  and which  in the case of development or re development properties  have achieved a target level of occupancy of for multi family residential properties and for commercial office  healthcare  industrial and retail properties 
for the comparison of fiscal years and  all or a portion of properties were non stabilized  of which non stabilized properties were redevelopment or in service development properties 
for the fiscal year comparison  all or a portion of properties were added to non stabilized and all or a portion of properties were moved to stabilized compared to the designations for the fiscal year comparison 
for the comparison of and  all or a portion of were non stabilized  of which non stabilized properties were redevelopment or in service development properties 
while there are judgments to be made regarding changes in designation  we typically remove properties from stabilized to non stabilized when redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact on property net operating income within the fiscal year 
acquisitions are moved to stabilized once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion 
our development projects in progress are not included in our non stabilized properties category until they are placed in service  which occurs upon the substantial completion of a commercial property  and upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy  in the case of a multi family residential development project 
they are then subsequently moved from non stabilized to stabilized when the property has been in service for the entirety of both periods being compared and has reached the target level of occupancy specified above

net income 
net income available to common shareholders for fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in net income in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the gain on involuntary conversion and the gain on sale of discontinued operations

in fiscal year net operating income net operating income noi is a non gaap measure which we define as total real estate revenues and gain on involuntary conversion less real estate expenses which consist of utilities  maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance  property management expenses and other property expenses 
we believe that noi is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit operating real estate because it provides a measure of core operations that is unaffected by depreciation  amortization  financing and general and administrative expense 
noi does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income  net income available for common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance 
the following tables show real estate revenues  real estate operating expenses  gain on involuntary conversion and noi by reportable operating segment for fiscal years  and for a reconciliation of net operating income of reportable segments to net income as reported  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the tables also show net operating income by reportable operating segment on a stabilized property and non stabilized property basis 
stabilized properties are properties owned or in service for the entirety of the periods being compared  and  in the case of development or re development properties  which have achieved a target level of occupancy of for multi family residential properties and for commercial office  healthcare  industrial and retail properties 
this comparison allows the company to evaluate the performance of existing properties and their contribution to net income 
management believes that measuring performance on a stabilized property basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how the company properties are performing year over year 
management uses this measure to assess whether or not it has been successful in increasing net operating income  renewing the leases of existing tenants  controlling operating costs and appropriately handling capital improvements 
the discussion below focuses on the main factors affecting real estate revenue and real estate expenses from stabilized properties  since changes from one fiscal year to another in real estate revenue and expenses from non stabilized properties are due to the addition of those properties to the company real estate portfolio  and accordingly provide less useful information for evaluating the ongoing operational performance of the company real estate portfolio

an analysis of noi by segment follows 
multi family residential real estate revenue from stabilized properties in our multi family residential segment increased by million in the twelve months ended april  compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
the continued levels of high occupancy allowed for rental rate increases of approximately million

these reductions in revenue were offset by an increase in percentage rent revenue of  at our edgewood vista senior living facilities due to a percentage rent clause that was newly effective in fiscal year and an increase in tenant reimbursements of  due to slight increases in occupancy and reimbursable expenses 
the revenue reduction at our wyoming senior living facilities which is offset by a million reduction in real estate expenses outlined below is the result of the restructuring of the company assisted living portfolio in the third quarter of fiscal year  when the company sold its wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary 
following the sale of this entity  the company revenue from its wyoming assisted living portfolio is received as rent under the lease agreement with the tenant in the facilities  and property management expenses are paid by the tenant  rather than as was previously the case included in the property management expense category of the company statements

an analysis of noi by segment follows 
multi family residential real estate revenue from stabilized properties in our multi family residential segment increased by approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year approximately million of this increase was due to increased occupancy across our multifamily portfolio  increased occupancy allowed for rental rate increases of approximately million of additional revenue in this segment in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the remainder of the real estate revenue increase is attributable to a decrease of  in allowances and concessions and an increase of  in other fee revenue items 
real estate expenses at stabilized properties decreased by  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the mild winter season permitted overall lower utilities usage for a reduction in expense of approximately  and reduced snow removal expenses by  additionally  of the  decrease in real estate expenses in this segment in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  approximately  was due to lower property management expense  which includes lower fees to third party managers  savings from the company internal management initiative and less bad debt write off

these reductions in revenue were offset by an increase in straight line rents of  and an increase in lease termination fees of  real estate expenses from stabilized properties decreased by approximately million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal  primarily due to maintenance expense decreasing by million  mainly as a result of lower snow removal costs  a reduction in real estate taxes of  due to successful appeals  and a reduction of  in third party management fees due to bringing property management in house  offset by an increase in insurance expense of  and an increase in other expense items of  in thousands  except percentages years ended april  change change commercial office real estate revenue stabilized non stabilized total real estate expenses stabilized non stabilized total net operating income stabilized non stabilized total occupancy stabilized non stabilized total rentable square footage stabilized non stabilized total annual report commercial healthcare real estate revenue from stabilized properties in our commercial healthcare segment decreased by approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenue of million at our wyoming senior living facilities following the sale of our trs and a change to a triple net lease structure in december the decrease was also due to a reduction of million in scheduled rent at some assisted living facilities  following amendment of the leases to shorten terms and remove purchase options 
lower occupancy also decreased revenue by approximately  offset by an increase in straight line rent of million and an increase in other revenue items of  real estate expenses from stabilized properties decreased by approximately million  primarily due to the operating change from a trs structure to a triple net lease structure  which reduced real estate expenses by approximately million  and to a decrease in maintenance expense of  primarily due to lower snow removal costs  a reduction in utilities expense of  and other total expense reductions of  these expense reductions were offset by an increase in real estate taxes of  and an increase in insurance expense of  in thousands  except percentages years ended april  change change commercial healthcare real estate revenue stabilized non stabilized total real estate expenses stabilized non stabilized total net operating income stabilized non stabilized total occupancy stabilized non stabilized total rentable square footage stabilized non stabilized total annual report commercial industrial real estate revenue from stabilized properties in our commercial industrial segment increased by approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased occupancy  which provided for additional revenue from rents of  and additional tenant reimbursements of  offset by an increase in allowance and concessions of  and an increase in other revenue items of  real estate expenses from stabilized properties decreased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a recovered bad debt from a former tenant in bankruptcy of approximately  and reduced utility expense of  offset by an increase in real estate taxes of  an increase in insurance expense of  and an increase in other total expenses of  in thousands  except percentages years ended april  change change commercial industrial real estate revenue stabilized non stabilized total real estate expenses stabilized non stabilized total net operating income stabilized non stabilized total occupancy stabilized non stabilized total rentable square footage stabilized non stabilized total annual report commercial retail real estate revenue from stabilized properties in our commercial retail segment decreased by approximately  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year occupancy increased as a percentage of square feet leased  however  lease renewal rates were lower for new or existing tenants

we attempt to mitigate tenant credit risk by working to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting criteria and monitoring our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants 
we believe that our credit risk is also mitigated by the fact that no individual tenant accounts for more than approximately of our total real estate rentals  although affiliated entities of edgewood vista together accounted for approximately of our total commercial segments minimum rents as of april  as of april   of our commercial properties  including all of our edgewood vista properties  all of our idaho spring creek senior housing properties  and all of our wyoming senior housing properties  were leased under triple net leases under which the tenant pays a monthly lump sum base rent as well as all costs associated with the property  including property taxes  insurance  replacement  repair or restoration  in addition to maintenance 
the failure by any of our triple net tenants to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties in accordance with the terms of their respective triple net leases could adversely affect their business reputations and ability to attract and retain residents and customers to our properties  which could have an indirect adverse effect on us 
we regularly monitor the relative credit risk of our significant tenants  including our triple net tenants 
the metrics the company uses to evaluate a significant tenant liquidity and creditworthiness depend on facts and circumstances specific to that tenant and to the industry in which it operates  and include the tenant credit history and economic conditions related to the tenant  its operations and the markets in which it operates  that may change over time 
prior to signing a lease with a tenant  the company generally assesses the prospective tenant credit quality through review of its financial statements and tax returns  and the result of that review is a factor in establishing the rent to be charged eg  higher risk tenants will be charged higher rent 
over the course of a lease  the company property management and asset management personnel have regular contact with tenants and tenant employees  and  where the terms of the lease permit  receive tenant financial information for periodic review  or review publicly available financial statements  in the case of public company tenants or non profit entities  such as hospital systems  whose financial statements are required to be filed with state agencies 
through these means the company monitors tenant credit quality

our ability to maintain or increase occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing the average effective rents in our commercial segments 
the increase in the average effective rental rates of new leases executed for the fiscal year ended april  when compared to new leases executed for the same period in the prior year is due primarily to the recovery of higher per square foot tenant improvements and leasing commissions and is not a function of significant increases in market rent

lease expirations our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates  and base rents  primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re lease expiring space

as of april  month to month leases accounted for  square feet 
annualized base rent is monthly scheduled rent as of april   multiplied by assuming that none of the tenants exercise renewal or termination options  and including leases renewed prior to expiration 
annual report information on current market rents can be difficult to obtain  is highly subjective  and is often not directly comparable between properties 
because of this  we believe the increase or decrease in effective rent on lease renewals  as previously defined  is the most objective and meaningful relationship between rents on leases expiring in the near term and current market rents

the company measures initial yield on its development projects upon completion and achievement of target lease up levels by measuring net operating income from the development against the cost of the project 
estimated initial yields on the projects listed below range from an estimated approximate to an estimated approximate initial yield 
while development costs in the company markets in the energy impacted region of western and central north dakota are significantly higher than in other company markets  the company continues to experience heightened tenant demand  low vacancy  and rent growth in this region  and accordingly actual initial yields upon project completion for projects in these markets have been trending higher than the estimated initial yields forecast at the project underwriting stage 
for example  the company estimated an approximately initial yield for its williston garden apartments project in williston  north dakota  the company calculates that actual initial yield after project completion and target lease up was approximately 
the company expects these trends of heightened tenant demand and low vacancy to continue to affect yields on its development projects in the region

commercial office to multi family residential units th quarter fiscal other n a n a n a n a funds from operations iret considers funds from operations ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit 
iret uses the definition of ffo adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
nareit defines ffo to mean net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
in addition  in october nareit clarified its computation of ffo so as to exclude impairment charges for all periods presented 
because of limitations of the ffo definition adopted by nareit  iret has made certain interpretations in applying the definition 
iret believes all such interpretations not specifically provided for in the nareit definition are consistent with the definition 
iret management considers that ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  the gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate properties and extraordinary items as defined by gaap  is useful to investors in providing an additional perspective on iret operating results 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation  that the value of real estate assets decreases predictably over time 
however  real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
nareit definition of ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  reflects the fact that depreciation charges required by gaap may not reflect underlying economic realities 
additionally  the exclusion  in nareit definition of ffo  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  assists iret management and investors in identifying the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of iret investments  and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
ffo is used by iret management and investors to identify trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs 
while ffo is widely used by reits as a primary performance metric  not all real estate companies use the same definition of ffo or calculate ffo in the same way 
accordingly  ffo presented here is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of iret performance  but rather should be considered as an additional  supplemental measure  and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  and is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of iret needs or its ability to service indebtedness or make distributions 
ffo applicable to common shares and limited partnership units for the fiscal year ended april  was million  compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended april  and  respectively

the company has historically met its short term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by its operating activities  and  from time to time  through draws on its lines of credit 
management considers the company ability to generate cash from property operating activities  cash out refinancing of existing properties and  from time to time  draws on its line of credit to be adequate to meet all operating requirements and to make distributions to its shareholders in accordance with the reit provisions of the internal revenue code 
budgeted expenditures for ongoing maintenance and capital improvements and renovations to our real estate portfolio are also generally expected to be funded from existing cash on hand  cash flow generated from property operations  cash out refinancing of existing properties  and or new borrowings  and the company believes it will have sufficient cash to meet its commitments over the next twelve months 
however  the commercial real estate markets continue to experience challenges including reduced occupancies and rental rates as well as some restrictions on the availability of financing 
in the event of deterioration in property operating results  or absent the company ability to successfully continue cash out refinancing of existing properties and or new borrowings  the company may need to consider additional cash preservation alternatives  including scaling back development activities  capital improvements and renovations 
budgeted expenditures for ongoing maintenance and capital improvements and renovations at our properties are also generally expected to be funded from existing cash on hand  cash flow generated from property operations  cash out refinancing of existing properties  and or new borrowings  and the company believes it will have sufficient cash to meet its commitments over the next twelve months  including an estimated million in capital expenditures excluding capital expenditures recoverable from tenants and tenant improvements 
for the fiscal year ended april   the company paid distributions of million in cash and million in common shares pursuant to our drip to common shareholders and unitholders of the operating partnership  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and ffo of million 
to the extent the company does not satisfy its long term liquidity requirements  which consist primarily of maturities under the company long term debt  construction and development activities and potential acquisition opportunities  through net cash flows provided by operating activities and its credit facilities  the company intends to satisfy such requirements through a combination of funding sources which the company believes will be available to it  including the issuance of upreit units  additional common or preferred equity  proceeds from the sale of properties  and additional long term secured or unsecured indebtedness 
however  our ability to raise funds through the sale of equity securities  the sale of properties  and additional long term secured or unsecured borrowings is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  our operating performance  and the current trading price of our common shares  and the capital and debt markets may not consistently be available at all or on terms that we consider attractive 
in particular  as a result of the economic downturn and turmoil in the capital markets  the availability of secured and unsecured loans was for a time sharply curtailed 
we cannot predict whether these conditions will recur 
as a result of general economic conditions in our markets  economic downturns affecting the ability to attract and retain tenants  unfavorable fluctuations in interest rates or our share price  unfavorable changes in the supply of competing properties  or our properties not performing as expected  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have access to capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain capital from other sources  we may not be able to pay the distribution required to maintain our status as a reit  make required principal and interest payments  make strategic acquisitions or make necessary routine capital improvements or undertake re development opportunities with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets 
in addition  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset values

as of april   the company believes it is in compliance with the facility covenants 
the company maintains compensating balances  not restricted as to withdrawal  with several financial institutions in connection with financing received from those institutions and or to ensure future credit availability 
at april   the company compensating balances totaled million and consisted of the following dacotah bank  minot  north dakota  deposit of  united community bank  minot  north dakota  deposit of  commerce bank  a minnesota banking corporation  deposit of  first international bank  watford city  north dakota  deposit of million  peoples state bank of velva  north dakota  deposit of  equity bank  minnetonka  minnesota  deposit of  associated bank  green bay  wisconsin  deposit of  venture bank  eagan  minnesota  deposit of  and american national bank  omaha  nebraska  deposit of on april  the company terminated its existing at the market atm equity program under which the company from time to time offered and sold common shares to fund acquisitions and development and redevelopment projects  to repay outstanding debt  and for other general corporate purposes 
for the three months ended april   the company issued no common shares under this program 
during the fiscal year ended april   the company issued  common shares at a weighted average price per share of for net cash proceeds of million  and paid approximately  in commissions related to the sales of these common shares

the company currently has no atm equity program in place 
during fiscal year  economic conditions in the united states continued to improve and credit markets continued to be stable  with credit availability relatively unconstrained and benchmark interest rates remaining at or near historic lows 
underwriting on commercial real estate continues to be more conservative compared to the underwriting standards employed prior to the recessionary period  however  and we continue to find recourse security more frequently required  lower amounts of proceeds available  and lenders limiting the amount of financing available in an effort to manage capital allocations and credit risk 
while we continue to expect to be able to refinance our maturing debt without significant issues  we also expect lenders to continue to employ conservative underwriting regarding asset quality  occupancy levels and tenant creditworthiness 
as we were in regard to fiscal year  we remain cautious regarding our ability in fiscal year to rely on cash out refinancing at levels we had achieved in recent years to provide funds for investment opportunities and other corporate purposes 
additionally  while to date there has been no material negative impact on our ability to borrow in our multi family segment  we continue to monitor proposals to modify the roles of the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the federal national mortgage association fannie mae in financing multi family residential properties 
we consider that one of the consequences of a modification in the agencies roles could potentially be a narrowing of their lending focus away from the smaller secondary or tertiary markets which we generally target  to multi family residential properties in major metropolitan markets 
iret obtains a majority of its multi family debt from primarily freddie mac  and we continue to plan to refinance a majority of our maturing multi family debt with these two entities  so any change in their ability or willingness to lend going forward would most likely result in higher loan costs and or more constricted availability of financing for us 
as of april   approximately  or million of our mortgage debt maturing in the next twelve months is placed on multi family residential assets  and approximately  or million  is placed on properties in our four commercial segments 
mortgage debt maturing in the first two quarters of fiscal year totals approximately million under mortgage loans secured by properties in minnesota  of this amount million was paid off on may  the company typically seeks to refinance its maturing mortgage debt  although under certain circumstances the company may choose to repay the debt rather than refinance  depending on the loan amount outstanding  company plans for the property securing the debt  interest rates and other loan terms available  and other factors specific to a particular property 
under present market conditions  the company currently expects to be able to refinance its individual mortgage loans maturing in the next twelve months  should it choose to refinance rather than pay off some or all of these loans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable rate debt obligations  and secondarily to our deposits with and investments in certain products issued by various financial institutions 
variable interest rates 
because approximately of our mortgage debt  as of april  and as of april  and  respectively  is at fixed interest rates  we have little exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk on our existing mortgage debt 
however  even though our goal is to maintain a fairly low exposure to interest rate risk  we are still vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates on any future repricing or refinancing of our fixed or variable rate debt and on future debt 
we primarily use long term more than nine years and medium term five to seven years debt as a source of capital 
we do not currently use derivative securities  interest rate swaps or any other type of hedging activity to manage our interest rate risk 
as of april   we had the following amount of future principal and interest payments due on mortgages secured by our real estate 
future principal payments in thousands  except percentages long term debt thereafter total fair value fixed rate average fixed interest rate variable rate average variable interest rate future interest payments in thousands long term debt thereafter total fixed rate variable rate as of april   the weighted average interest rate on our fixed rate and variable rate loans was and  respectively
