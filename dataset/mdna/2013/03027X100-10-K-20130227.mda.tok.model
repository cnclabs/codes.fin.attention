item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto  and the information set forth under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates below 
our continuing operations are reported in three segments  domestic rental and management  international rental and management and network and development services 
among other factors  management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit in its assessment of operating performance in each business segment 
we define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses  excluding stock based compensation recorded in costs of operations  depreciation  amortization and accretion  selling  general  administrative and development expense  and other operating expense 
we define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling  general  administrative and development expense attributable to the segment  excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses 
segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the international rental and management segment also include interest income  tv azteca  net see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
these measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income  interest expense  loss on retirement of long term obligations  other income expense  net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest  income loss on equity method investments  income taxes and discontinued operations 
executive overview our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi tenant communications sites to wireless service providers  radio and television broadcast companies  wireless data providers  government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries 
in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio  we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements 
we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third party tower operators 
we refer to this business as our rental and management operations  which accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment 
through our network development services segment  we offer tower related services domestically  including site acquisition  zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services  which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites 
we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective january  
table of contents the following table details the number of communications sites we own or operate in the countries in which we operate as of december  country number of owned sites number of operated sites united states international brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa uganda all of the sites we operate are held pursuant to long term capital leases  including those subject to purchase options 
the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial non cancellable term of five to ten years  with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter 
accordingly  nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december  is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december   we expect to generate approximately billion of non cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods  excluding the impact of straight line lease accounting 
in addition  most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease  typically annually based on a fixed percentage on average approximately in the united states  inflation  or inflation with a fixed minimum or maximum escalation for the year 
revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancellable term of the applicable agreement 
we also routinely seek to extend our leases with our tenants  which increases the non cancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues 
the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases 
as discussed above  most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts  which typically are non cancellable  however in some instances  a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee 
revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations 
during the year ended december   loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than of our rental and management operations revenues 
rental and management operations revenue growth 
the primary factors affecting the revenue growth for our domestic and international rental and management segments are recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period legacy sites  contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases  net of cancellations  new revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites  and new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new sites 

table of contents we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites  which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites 
in addition  we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers 
our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities  which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their networks as well as roll out next generation wireless technologies 
in addition  we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment criteria 
rental and management operations organic revenue growth 
consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites  our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation 
our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks 
this rate  in turn  is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs  the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital  and general economic conditions 
the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth domestic 
as a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of wireless data applications  wireless service providers in the united states continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites 
this level of wireless communications services growth has driven wireless providers in the united states to deploy consistent levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result  we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites 
we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us the deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution 
as a result  our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing networks 
wireless service providers compete based on the overall capacity and coverage of their existing wireless networks 
to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases  our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites as well as add new cell sites 
wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of on site generators  which results in additional equipment leased at the tower site 
wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum  and as a result are expected to add additional equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration 
we signed holistic master lease agreements with three of our four major tenants in the united states  which provide for consistent  long term revenue growth and a reduction in the potential impact of churn 
typically  these agreements include built in annual escalators  fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a pre determined amount of equipment on our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded 
our holistic master lease agreements build and foster strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times  thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly deploy technology on our sites 
international 
most of our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services 
as a result  demand for our communications sites is predominantly driven by continued voice network investments  new market entrants and initial third generation g data network deployments 
for example  in india  nationwide voice networks 
table of contents continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their investments in g data networks 
similarly  in ghana and uganda  wireless service providers continue to build out their voice and data networks in order to satisfy increasing demand for wireless services 
in south africa  where voice networks are in a more advanced stage of development  carriers are beginning to deploy g data networks across spectrum acquired in recent spectrum auctions 
in mexico and brazil  where nationwide voice networks have also been deployed  some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their g data networks  and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers to begin their initial investments in g data networks 
in markets such as chile  peru and colombia  recent or anticipated spectrum auctions are expected to drive investment in nationwide voice and g data networks 
in germany  our most mature international wireless market  demand is currently being driven by a government mandated rural fourth generation network build out  as well as other tenant initiatives to deploy next generation wireless services 
we believe incremental demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks 
rental and management operations new site revenue growth 
during the year ended december   we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through acquisitions and construction activities  including the acquisition and construction of approximately  sites 
in a majority of our international markets  the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased pass through revenues and expenses 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios  both domestically and internationally  to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio 
new sites acquired or constructed domestic international the majority of sites acquired or constructed in were in brazil  germany  india and uganda  in were in brazil  colombia  ghana  india  mexico and south africa  and in were in chile  colombia  india and peru 
network development services segment revenue growth 
as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations  we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our total revenues 
through our network development services segment  we offer tower related services  including site acquisition  zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services  which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites  including in connection with provider network upgrades 
rental and management operations expenses 
direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance  security and power and fuel costs  some of which may be passed through to our tenants 
these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling  general  administrative and development expenses  which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling  general  administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
in general  our domestic and international rental and management segments selling  general  administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year over year 
as a result  leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow 
we may incur additional segment selling  general  administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio 
our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities 

table of contents reit conversion 
we began operating as a reit effective january  the reit tax rules require that we derive most of our income  other than income generated by a trs  from investments in real estate  which for us primarily consists of income from the leasing of our communications sites 
under the code  maintaining reit status generally requires that no more than of the value of the reit s assets be represented by securities of one or more trss and other non qualifying assets 
a reit must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least of its reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain 
during the year ended december   we paid an aggregate of approximately million in regular cash distributions to our stockholders 
we intend to continue paying regular distributions in the amount  timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors  a number of which may be beyond our control  including our financial condition and operating cash flows  the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay  limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments  our ability to utilize nols to offset  in whole or in part  our distribution requirements  limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
for more information on the requirements to qualify as a reit  see item of this annual report under the caption business overview  and item a of this annual report under the caption risk factors if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit  we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates  which would substantially reduce funds otherwise available and certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes  which reduce our cash flows  and may have deferred and contingent tax liabilities 
non gaap financial measures included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and accretion  as adjusted adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss on discontinued operations  net  income loss from equity method investments  income tax provision benefit  other income expense  loss on retirement of long term obligations  interest expense  interest income  other operating expenses  depreciation  amortization and accretion  and stock based compensation expense 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap 
rather  adjusted ebitda is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments  it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants  it is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation  amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives  particularly where acquisitions and non operating factors are involved  it provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period to period operating performance by eliminating items which are not operational in nature  and it provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of different companies by excluding the impact of long term strategic decisions which can differ significantly from company to company  such as decisions with respect to capital structure  capital investments and the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate 
our measurement of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most directly comparable gaap measure  has been included below

stock repurchase program 
in march  our board of directors approved the buyback  pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to billion of common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million  including commissions and fees  pursuant to the buyback 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock under the buyback for an aggregate of million  including commissions and fees 

table of contents between january  and january   we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million  including commissions and fees  pursuant to the buyback 
as of january   we had repurchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock under the buyback for an aggregate of million  including commissions and fees 
under the buyback  we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements  and subject to market conditions and other factors 
to facilitate repurchases  we make purchases pursuant to trading plans under rule b of the exchange act  which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods 
we expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining billion under the buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors 
in the near term  we expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
purchases under the buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases 
sales of equity securities 
we receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans 
for the year ended december   we received an aggregate of million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercises of stock options 
distributions 
as a reit  we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain 
generally  we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income so as to not be subject to income tax or excise tax on undistributed reit taxable income 
the amount  timing and frequency of future distributions  however  will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors  a number of which may be beyond our control  including our financial condition and operating cash flows  the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay  limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments  our ability to utilize nols to offset our distribution requirements  limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant

table of contents contractual obligations 
our contractual obligations relate primarily to the commercial mortgage pass through certificates  series issued in our may securitization transaction the securitization  borrowings under our credit facilities  our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers

the colombian bridge loans are denominated in colombian pesos 
the maturity dates may be extended from time to time 
denominated in us dollars 
the south african facility is denominated in south african rand 
operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancellable initial terms  as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases  thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease 
primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet  primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash 
other non current liabilities exclude million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled 
settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe 
however  based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements  we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes  if any  to previously recorded uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   we held ten interest rate swap agreements  all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges  and which had an aggregate notional amount of million  interest rates ranging from to and expiration dates through november factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts  a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
accordingly  a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies 
in addition  our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 
restrictions under loan agreements relating to the credit facility  the credit facility and the term loan 
the loan agreements for the credit facility  the credit facility and the term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
these include limitations on additional debt  distributions and dividends  guaranties  sales of assets and liens 
the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage  senior secured leverage and interest coverage  as set forth below 
where we designate 
table of contents certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries in accordance with the respective agreements  those subsidiaries are excluded for purposes of the covenant calculations 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of to 
based on our financial performance for the months ended december   we could incur approximately billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio 
in addition  if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels  our revenues could decrease by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt as defined in the loan agreements to adjusted ebitda of to 
based on our financial performance for the months ended december   we could incur approximately billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio  effectively  however  this ratio would be limited to billion to remain in compliance with other covenants 
in addition  if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels  our revenues could decrease by approximately billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
interest coverage ratio this ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense as defined in the loan agreements of not less than to 
based on our financial performance for the months ended december   our interest expense  which was million for that period  could increase by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
in addition  if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels  our revenues could decrease by approximately million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio 
the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods 
if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis  we would be in breach of these covenants 
any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities  but would constitute a default under these credit facilities  which could result in  among other things  the amounts outstanding  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  becoming immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness 
the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for the credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 
restrictions under loan agreement relating to the securitization 
the loan agreement related to the securitization involves assets related to  broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the company the borrowers  through a private offering of billion of commercial mortgage pass through certificates  series the certificates 
as of december    broadcast and wireless communications towers are owned by the two special purpose subsidiaries 
the securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations 
among other things  the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets 
the borrowers organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities  including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent 
table of contents directors 
the securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets  promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization  and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers  including the right to conduct site investigations 
under the terms of the securitization loan agreement  the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the securitization  which must be deposited  and thereafter distributed  solely pursuant to the terms of the securitization loan 
the borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the securitization loan 
on a monthly basis  all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments  to fund required reserves  to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the securitization loan  referred to as excess cash flow  is to be released to the borrowers for distribution to us 
during the year ended december   the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately million 
in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us  the borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage dscr 
for this purpose  dscr is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the borrowers net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest  servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers must pay over the succeeding months on the securitization loan 
pursuant to one such test  if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter were x or less the cash trap dscr  then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the borrowers for distribution to us until the dscr exceeded the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters 
additionally  while the anticipated repayment date is not until april  excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an amortization period under the securitization loan until april an amortization period would commence under the securitization loan if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below x the minimum dscr 
in such a case  all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the dscr exceeded the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters  and so would not be available for distribution to us 
consequently  a failure to comply with the covenants in the securitization loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers 
additionally  a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us  which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures  including tower construction and acquisitions  pay reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program 
in addition  if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization  the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization  in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 
as of december   the borrowers dscr was x 
based on the borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december  and the amount of interest  servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding months on the securitization loan  the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately million in net cash flow before triggering a cash trap dscr  and approximately million in net cash flow before triggering an amortization period 
as discussed above  we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness 
in addition  in order to fund capital expenditures  future growth and expansion initiatives  satisfy our reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program  we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities 
if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to 
table of contents raise additional capital  we may be unable to do so  or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness 
if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise  we may not be able to fund capital expenditures  future growth and expansion initiatives  satisfy our reit distribution requirements  refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program 
in addition  our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities 
as set forth under the caption risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and  consequently  a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to impairment of assets  asset retirement obligations  accounting for acquisitions  revenue recognition  rent expense  stock based compensation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
impairment of assets assets subject to depreciation and amortization we review long lived assets  including intangibles  for impairment at least annually or whenever events  changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable 
we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows  typically at an individual tower basis 
possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues 
a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates  among other items  the tower location  the tower location demographics  the timing of additions of new tenants  lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements 
to the extent that cash flows generated under this approach are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the towers  an impairment charge is recognized for the towers and network location intangible assets 
we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 
we monitor our customer related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment  such as high levels of turnover or attrition  non renewal of a significant number of contracts  or the cancellation or termination of a relationship 
we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the customer related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows 
if we determine that the carrying value of the customer related intangible asset may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset  as compared to the asset s carrying value 
we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment 

table of contents impairment of assets goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment 
we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment 
when conducting this test  we employ a discounted cash flow analysis 
the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance  terminal sales growth rate  management s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements  the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate 
under the first step of this test  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit  as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows  to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we conduct the second step of this test  in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
during the year ended december   no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test 
the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin  except for two reporting units  whose fair value exceed the carrying value by approximately million 
for these two reporting units  we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually  which we determined to be reasonable  would impact our conclusions a reduction in projected net income  or a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital  or a reduction in terminal sales growth rate 
the goodwill recorded in these two reporting units approximated million as of december   and is the result of recently completed acquisitions 
accordingly  the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due  in part  to the timing of the underlying acquisitions s  current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the planned amounts 
due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date  the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business 
asset retirement obligations we recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs  which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located  in the period in which they are incurred  if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made  and we accrete such liability through the obligation s estimated settlement date 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or captured as a component of purchase accounting 
we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation  which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of million during the year ended december  the change in primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions 
fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows  and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense 
the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals  cost of tower removals  timing and number of land lease renewals  expected inflation rates  and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate 
while we feel the assumptions are appropriate  there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates 
we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 

table of contents acquisitions for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination  we allocate the purchase price  including any contingent consideration  to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 
for those transactions that do not meet the definition of a business combination  we allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets primarily acquired customer related and network location intangibles 
the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods 
when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired  we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age  condition and the economic useful life of the asset 
when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired  we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows  including rate and terms of renewal and attrition 
the determination of the final purchase price and acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized 
revenue recognition rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectability is reasonably assured  regardless of whether the payments from the tenants are received in equal monthly amounts 
fixed escalation clauses present in non cancellable lease agreements  excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other inflation based indices  and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are recognized on a straight line basis over the fixed  non cancellable terms of the applicable leases 
total rental and management straight line revenues for the years ended december   and approximated million  million and million  respectively 
amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases 
amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition has been met 
we derive the largest portion of our revenues  corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry  and approximately of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry 
in addition  we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas 
we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants 
in recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight line basis 
this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed 
to the extent the amounts  based on management s estimates  may not be collectible  recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved 
any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense 
accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured 
rent expense many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations  which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time 
we calculate straight line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods  if any  for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured 
certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease  if the tenant exercises its renewal option 
for towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease  we calculate our straight line ground rent over the term of the ground lease  including all renewal options required 
table of contents to fulfill the tenant lease obligation 
in addition to the straight line ground rent expense recorded  we also record an associated straight line rent liability in other non current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited 
the fair value of a stock option is determined using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock  the expected distributions  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date 
we recognize stock based compensation in either selling  general  administrative and development expense  costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets 
income taxes we will elect to be taxed as a reit under the code effective january   and will generally not be subject to federal and state income taxes on our qrss taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders provided we meet certain organization and operating requirements 
however  even as a reit  we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our trs assets 
in addition  our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted 
accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes 
to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes  deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns  which may differ from the current rate 
at december   we reversed deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our reit activities as a result of a reduction of the expected tax rate 
as a reit  we will not pay federal income tax on our qrss  because a dividends paid deduction will be available to offset our taxable income 
additionally  we will be permitted to use nols to offset our reit taxable income 
we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income 
we periodically review our deferred tax assets  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately million on deferred tax assets for certain of our subsidiaries  which primarily relates to foreign nols 
we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax asset  primarily our foreign and federal nols related to other trs entities  as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these nols during the applicable carryforward period 
valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability 
the recoverability of our us federal net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations 
accordingly  the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period  management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future  we will be required to reassess our deferred tax assets and consider an adjustment to our valuation allowances 

table of contents changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination  which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe  or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses 
we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to million 
as of december   we have classified approximately million of reserves for uncertain tax positions as other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we also classified approximately million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties as other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws  regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations 
from time to time  we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december  we consider the earnings of certain non us subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs 
we have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the us federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the united states 
should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings  we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states

a increase in current interest rates would result in an additional million of interest expense for the year ended december  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally 
any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate
