item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following table sets forth the amounts and categories of the bank s non performing assets non performing loans  non performing troubled debt restructured  and foreclosed real estate and troubled debt restructurings for the last three years 
it is the policy of the bank that all earned but uncollected interest on all past due loans is reviewed monthly to determine what portion of it should be classified as uncollectible for loans past due in excess of days 
uncollectible interest is written off monthly

as of that date  management was not aware of any other assets that would need to be disclosed as non performing assets 
delinquent loans 
the following table sets forth certain information at december    and relating to delinquencies in the bank s portfolio 
delinquent loans that are days or more past due are considered non performing assets 
for the period ending december   delinquent purchased credit impaired loans with a fair value of million were excluded from the table below

the bank s asset classification policy provides for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities of lesser quality as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss assets 
an asset is treated as a special mention when the assets are currently protected but have credit weaknesses that warrant a higher degree of attention from management 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
an insured institution is required to establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management for loans classified substandard or doubtful  as well as for other problem loans 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
the bank regularly reviews its loan portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulation 
not all of the bank s classified assets constitute non performing assets  although the balances of non performing loans as a percent of total classified is higher than in prior years 
historically  management has been conservative in its listing of assets as classified  especially in comparison to peer classification of similar assets and to actual delinquency status 
whereas classified loans for the bank historically have been a conservative list of loans warranting scrutiny  in and the classified list has become weighted heavily by loans and relationships in the lengthy process of foreclosure 
the mating of the conservative approach in monitoring problem loans and loans lingering due to foreclosure has created a larger than historical balance of classified assets 
as a result  the bank remains somewhat higher than peer on balances of loans classified 
the classification of assets listing is evaluated monthly by a committee comprised of lending personnel  the bank chief executive officer  the chief financial officer  loan review personnel  the collection officer  and the bank s internal auditor 
the list encompasses entire relationships  rather than single problem loans  and removal of loans from the list is only approved by the committee upon demonstrated performance by the borrower 
at december   the bank s classified assets  were as follows at december  in thousands substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified assets regulatory definition requires that total classified assets include classified loans  which at december  included million as substandard and million as doubtful  other real estate owned as a result of foreclosure or other legal proceedings of million  also considered substandard  and two below investment grade corporate securities  considered substandard  totaling million 
detail of classified loans by loan segment is provided in footnote to the consolidated financial statements presented later in this report on form k 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to earnings 
the provision for loan losses is determined in conjunction with management s review and evaluation of current economic conditions including those of the bank s lending area  changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio  loan delinquencies current status as well as past and anticipated trends and adequacy of collateral securing loan delinquencies  historical and estimated net charge offs and other pertinent information derived from a review of the loan portfolio 
in management s opinion  the bank s allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses from loans at december  however  there can be no assurance that regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan portfolio in the future  will not require increases in its allowances for loan losses or that changes in economic conditions will not adversely affect the bank s loan portfolio

the bank s investment portfolio excluding mortgage backed securities consists of us government and agency obligations  corporate bonds  municipal securities and federal home loan bank fhlb stock 
at december   total investments in the portfolio  as defined above and including mortgage backed securities  had a combined carrying value of approximately million  or  of the consolidated total assets 
investments reported in the financial statements of the company are held both at the bank level and at the bank s nevada subsidiaries 
all company investments are available for sale  but the intent of the company is to hold investments to maturity 
liquidity is met through a combination of deposit growth  borrowing from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis  and if needed  sale of investments held at the bank level 
securities held through the nevada subsidiaries are held primarily for investment purposes 
securities held at the bank level are held primarily for liquidity purposes 
in  liquidity needs were met primarily through deposit growth and the same held true for sales of investments over the last months have been made primarily to take advantage of gain positions on short term investments  especially those expected to be called in the near future  while funds from maturing investments were reinvested primarily into high quality mortage backed securities and long term municipals 
the portfolio increased by million from december  to the same date in  as million of us government and agency securities  most at yields of less than  were purchased at the nevada subsidiary level 
also  at the nevada subsidiary level  million in purchases of high quality mortgage and asset backed securities were offset by reductions for a slight overall increase of million 
offsetting the purchase were decreases  primarily of periodic paydown on these investments while the remainder represented sales and maturities  as the company took advantage of high gains on sale to offset extraordinary expenses associated with the acquisition of dupont state bank 
the acquisition of dupont state bank included million in available for sale securities  primarily us government and agency securities and asset backed securities 
during the fourth quarter million of these securities were sold to repay federal home loan bank of indianapolis advances  and improve the net margin of the company 
municipal securities  managed at the nevada subsidiary level  increased slightly for the year 
the carrying value of the two trust preferred investments held by the company  considered to be of higher risk than most investments  improved from million as of december  to million as of december  the net unrealized gain on the portfolio was million at december  and million at december  the following table sets forth the amortized cost and the market value of the bank s investment portfolio  excluding mortgage backed investments  at the dates indicated

the bank maintains a portfolio of mortgage backed pass through securities in the form of fhlmc  fnma and government national mortgage association gnma participation certificates 
mortgage backed pass through securities generally entitle the bank to receive a portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages and gives the bank an interest in that pool of mortgages 
fhlmc  fnma and gnma securities are each guaranteed by its respective agencies as to principal and interest 
although mortgage backed securities generally yield less than individual loans originated by the bank  they present less credit risk 
because mortgage backed securities have a lower yield relative to current market rates  retention of such investments could adversely affect the bank s earnings  particularly in a rising interest rate environment 
the mortgage backed securities portfolio is generally considered to have very low credit risk because the securities are guaranteed as to principal repayment by the issuing agency 
in addition  the bank has purchased adjustable rate mortgage backed securities as part of its effort to reduce its interest rate risk 
in a period of declining interest rates  the bank is subject to prepayment risk on such adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
the bank attempts to mitigate this prepayment risk by purchasing mortgage backed securities at or near par 
if interest rates rise in general  the interest rates on the loans backing the mortgage backed securities will also adjust upward  subject to the interest rate caps in the underlying mortgage loans 
however  the bank is still subject to interest rate risk on such securities if interest rates rise faster than to maximum annual interest rate adjustments on the underlying loans 
at december   the bank had mortgage backed securities with a carrying value of approximately million  all of which were classified as available for sale 
these mortgage backed securities may be used as collateral for borrowings and  through repayments  as a source of liquidity

deposits have traditionally been the bank s primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities 
in addition to deposits  the bank derives funds from scheduled loan payments  investment maturities  loan prepayments  retained earnings  income on earning assets  and borrowings 
while scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds  deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates  market conditions  and levels of competition 
borrowings from the fhlb of indianapolis and other sources of wholesale funding may be used in the short term to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
deposits 
deposits are attracted through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments including fixed rate certificates of deposit  now  mmdas and other transaction accounts  individual retirement accounts and savings accounts 
the bank actively solicits and advertises for deposits in jefferson  clark  floyd  jackson and jennings counties in indiana and in trimble and carroll county  kentucky 
deposits will come from all of our market areas 
deposit account terms vary  with the principal differences being the minimum balance required  the amount of time the funds remain on deposit and the interest rate 
the bank does not pay a fee for any deposits it receives 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the bank on a periodic basis 
determination of rates and terms are predicated on funds acquisition and liquidity requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and applicable regulations 
the bank relies  in part  on customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain its deposits  but also closely prices its deposits in relation to rates offered by its competitors 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market and prevailing interest rates and competition 
the variety of deposit accounts offered by the bank has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand 
the bank has become more susceptible to short term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate conscious 
the bank manages the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset liability management and profitability objectives 
historically  now and mmdas have been relatively stable sources of deposits 
during  the single largest item impacting deposit levels was the acquisition of dupont state bank and the million in deposits acquired 
that deposit base was comprise of maturity deposits totaling million  interest bearing transactional deposits totaling million and noninterest bearing deposits totaling million 
other than the impact of the acquisition  the company saw little change overall in the amount of deposits year to year 
there was  however  a change in the mix of pre merger deposits as approximately million in maturity deposits shifted to transactional deposit accounts  some into noninterest bearing accounts 
taking into consideration the impact of the acquisition on deposits in total  transactional deposits  primarily now and mmda accounts  increased significantly from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million  or 
the ability of the bank to attract and maintain certificates of deposit  and the rates paid on these deposits  have been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions 
due primarily to the acquisition  and despite the shift from maturity deposits to transactional deposits  certificate of deposit balances increased million  or  from the balance of million as of december  to million at december  as certificates of deposit repriced and new certificates were added  the lower interest rates for these items caused a significant decline in the cost of deposits 
as a result  cost of deposits for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december   a drop of basis points  period to period 
this change resulted in a weighted average rate for deposits of at december   a decline of basis points from the at december  an analysis of the company s deposit accounts by type  maturity and rate at december  is as follows type of account minimum opening balance balance at december  of deposits weighted average rate dollars in thousands withdrawable noninterest bearing accounts savings accounts mmda now accounts total withdrawable certificates original terms ira months months months months months months months months months months months months jumbo certificates total certificates total deposits the following table sets forth  by various interest rate categories  the composition of time deposits of the bank at the dates indicated at december  in thousands to to to to to to total the following table represents  by various interest rate categories  the amounts of time deposits maturing during each of the three years following december  matured certificates  which have not been renewed as of december   have been allocated based upon certain rollover assumptions

the bank focuses on generating high quality loans and then seeks the best source of funding from deposits  investments  or borrowings 
the bank had million in fhlb advances at december   as compared to million held at the same point in the average rates paid on those borrowings  however  increased basis points across the period  from as of december  to as of december   as the company prepaid million in advances 
the bank does not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining advances appropriate to meet its requirements in the future 
during the fiscal year the bank prepaid million in fhlb advances with a prepayment penalty of  with the acquisition of dupont state bank and availability of additional cash and investments  the bank chose to restructure a portion of its liabilities by selling million in available for sale securities at a gain of  the net effect allowed for an improvement of the overall net interest margin as the bank prepaid higher costing borrowings by selling lower yielding investments at a profit

employees as of december   the bank employed persons on a full time basis and persons on a part time basis 
none of the employees is represented by a collective bargaining group 
management considers its employee relations to be good 
competition the bank originates most of its loans to and accepts most of its deposits from residents of jefferson  jackson  jennings  floyd and clark counties  indiana and carroll county  ky 
the bank is subject to competition from various financial institutions  including state and national banks  state and federal savings associations  credit unions and certain non banking consumer lenders that provide similar services in these counties 
some of these institutions have significantly larger resources available to them than does the bank 
in total  there are banks and approximately credit unions located in the six county market area  including the bank 
the bank also competes with money market funds and brokerage accounts with respect to deposit accounts and with insurance companies with respect to individual retirement accounts 
the primary factors influencing competition for deposits are interest rates  service and convenience of office locations 
the bank competes for loan originations primarily through the efficiency and quality of services it provides borrowers and through interest rates and loan fees charged 
competition is affected by  among other things  the general availability of lendable funds  general and local economic conditions  current interest rate levels and other factors that are not readily predictable 
regulation and supervision general the bank is subject to examination  supervision and regulation by the indiana department of financial institutions dfi  and the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
the holding company is a bank holding company  subject to oversight by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve 
this discussion will summarize the effect of existing and probable governmental regulations on the operations of the holding company and the bank as a bank holding company and a state commercial bank  respectively 
bank holding company regulation as a registered bank holding company for the bank  the holding company is subject to the regulation and supervision of the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of  as amended bhca 
bank holding companies are required to file periodic reports with and are subject to periodic examination by the federal reserve 
under the bhca  without the prior approval of the federal reserve  the holding company may not acquire direct or indirect control of more than of the voting stock or substantially all of the assets of any company  including a bank  and may not merge or consolidate with another bank holding company 
in addition  the holding company is generally prohibited by the bhca from engaging in any nonbanking business unless such business is determined by the federal reserve to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
under the bhca  the federal reserve has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank upon the federal reserve determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company 
under the dodd frank act  a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks 
pursuant to this requirement  a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it or  for other reasons  would not be inclined to provide it 
additionally  under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  a bank holding company is required to provide limited guarantee of the compliance by any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become undercapitalized as defined in the statute with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency 
gramm leach bliley act under the gramm leach bliley act gramm leach  bank holding companies are permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
in order to engage in these new financial activities  a bank holding company must qualify and register with the federal reserve as a financial holding company by demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is well capitalized  well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
gramm leach established a system of functional regulation  under which the federal banking agencies regulate the banking activities of financial holding companies  the us securities and exchange commission regulates their securities activities and state insurance regulators regulate their insurance activities 
the holding company has no current intention to elect to become a financial holding company under gramm leach 
under gramm leach  federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
the rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties 
the privacy provisions of gramm leach affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
the holding company does not disclose any nonpublic information about any current or former customers to anyone except as permitted by law and subject to contractual confidentiality provisions which restrict the release and use of such information 
state commercial bank regulation as an indiana commercial bank  the bank is subject to federal regulation and supervision by the fdic and to state regulation and supervision by the dfi 
the bank s deposit accounts are insured by the deposit insurance fund dif  which is administered by the fdic 
both federal and indiana law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements  truth in lending and truth in savings disclosures  equal credit opportunity  fair credit reporting  trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations 
state bank activities under federal law  as implemented by regulations adopted by the fdic  fdic insured state banks are prohibited  subject to certain exceptions  from making or retaining equity investments of a type  or in an amount  that are not permissible for a national bank 
federal law  as implemented by fdic regulations  also prohibits fdic insured state banks and their subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions  from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank or its subsidiary  respectively  unless the bank meets  and could continue to meet  its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the fdic determines that the activity would not pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund of which the bank is a member 
impermissible investments and activities must be divested or discontinued within certain time frames set by the fdic 
it is not expected that these restrictions will have a material impact on the operations of the bank 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the fhlb system  which consists of regional banks 
the federal housing finance board fhfb  an independent agency  controls the fhlb system  including the fhlb of indianapolis 
the fhlb system provides a central credit facility primarily for member financial institutions 
at december   the bank s investment in stock of the fhlb of indianapolis was million 
for the fiscal year ended december   the fhlb of indianapolis paid approximately  in cash dividends to the bank 
annualized  this income would have a rate of 
the rate paid during the period ended december  was higher than the paid for the period ended december   primarily due to improvement in the financial condition of the fhlb of indianapolis in the last few years 
all fhlbs are required to provide funds to establish affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances to members to be used for lending at subsidized interest rates for low and moderate income  owner occupied housing projects  affordable rental housing  and certain other community projects 
these contributions and obligations could adversely affect the value of fhlb stock in the future 
a reduction in the value of such stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the bank s capital 
the fhlb of indianapolis serves as a reserve or central bank for its member institutions 
it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
it makes advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb and the board of directors of the fhlb of indianapolis 
interest rates charged for advances vary depending upon maturity  the cost of funds to the fhlb of indianapolis and the purpose of the borrowing 
all fhlb advances must be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the fhlb 
eligible collateral includes first mortgage loans not more than days delinquent or securities evidencing interests therein  securities including mortgage backed securities issued  insured or guaranteed by the federal government or any agency thereof  cash or fhlb deposits  certain small business and agricultural loans of smaller institutions and real estate with readily ascertainable value in which a perfected security interest may be obtained 
other forms of collateral may be accepted as additional security or  under certain circumstances  to renew outstanding advances 
all long term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing  and the fhlb has established standards of community service that members must meet to maintain access to long term advances 
at december  the bank had million in such borrowings  with an additional million available  previously approved by the board of directors 
federal reserve system the federal reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain noninterest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts  which are primarily checking and now accounts  and non personal time deposits 
the effect of these reserve requirements is to increase the bank s cost of funds 
at december   the bank was in compliance with its reserve requirements 
insurance of deposits deposits in the bank are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic up to a maximum amount  which is generally  per depositor  subject to aggregation rules 
the dodd frank act extended unlimited insurance on non interest bearing accounts through december  under this program  traditional non interest demand deposit or checking accounts that allow for an unlimited number of transfers and withdrawals at any time  whether held for a business  individual  or other type of depositor  were covered 
later  congress added lawyers trust accounts iolta to this unlimited insurance protection through december  because this program expired on december   there is no longer unlimited insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts 
deposits held in non interest bearing transaction accounts are now aggregated with interest bearing deposits the owner may hold in the same ownership category  and the combined total is insured up to  the bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments by the fdic pursuant to its regulations establishing a risk related deposit insurance assessment system  based upon the institution s capital levels and risk profile 
under the fdic s risk based assessment system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk weighted categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels  and certain other factors  with less risky institutions paying lower assessments 
an institution s initial assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
there are also adjustments to a bank s initial assessment rates based on levels of long term unsecured debt  secured liabilities in excess of of domestic deposits and  for certain institutions  brokered deposit levels 
under the rules in effect through march   initial assessments ranged from to basis points of assessable deposits  and the bank paid assessments at the rate of basis points for each of insured deposits 
however  pursuant to fdic rules adopted under the dodd frank act  effective april   initial assessments ranged from to basis points of the institution s total assets minus its tangible equity 
the bank paid deposit insurance assessments at the rate of basis points for each of insured deposits during the year ended december  no institution may pay a dividend if it is in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment 
the bank is also subject to assessment for the financing corporation fico to service the interest on its bond obligations 
the amount assessed on individual institutions  including the bank  by fico is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance according to the risk related assessment rate schedule 
these assessments will continue until the fico bonds are repaid between and during  the fico assessment rate was basis points for each of the same assessment bases applicable to the fdic assessment 
for the first quarter of  the fico assessment rate is basis points 
the bank expensed deposit insurance assessments including the fico assessments of  during the year ended december  future increases in deposit insurance premiums or changes in risk classification would increase the bank s deposit related costs 
on december   banks were required to pay the fourth quarter fdic assessment and to prepay estimated insurance assessments for the years through on that date 
the prepayment did not affect the bank s earnings on that date 
the bank paid an aggregate of million in premiums on december   million of which constituted prepaid premiums 
under the dodd frank act  the fdic is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at no less than  and must achieve the designated reserve ratio by september  the fdic must offset the effect of the increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio from to on insured depository institutions of less than billion  and may declare dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar quarter is at least  although the fdic has the authority to suspend or limit such permitted dividend declarations 
in december   the fdic adopted a final rule setting the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at of estimated insured deposits 
on october   the fdic proposed a comprehensive long range plan for deposit insurance fund management with the goals of maintaining a positive fund balance  even during periods of large fund losses  and maintaining steady  predictable assessment rates throughout economic and credit cycles 
the fdic determined not to increase assessments in by basis points  as previously proposed  but to keep the current rate schedule in effect 
in addition  the fdic proposed adopting a lower assessment rate schedule when the designated reserve ratio reaches so that the average rate over time should be about basis points 
in lieu of dividends  the fdic proposed adopting lower rate schedules when the reserve ratio reaches and  so that the average rates will decline about percent and percent  respectively 
under the dodd frank act  the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums was changed from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  affecting assessments for the last two quarters of  as well as future assessments 
tangible equity for this purpose means tier capital 
since this is a larger base than adjusted domestic deposits  assessment rates are expected to be lower for the bank as a result of these changes  which were first reflected in invoices due september  the new fdic rule to implement the revised assessment requirements includes rate schedules scaled to the increase in the assessment base  including schedules that will go into effect when the reserve ratio reaches  and 
the fdic staff has projected that the new rate schedules will be approximately revenue neutral 
the schedule would reduce the initial base assessment rate in each of the four risk based pricing categories 
for small risk category i banks  the rates would range from basis points 
the proposed rates for small institutions in risk categories ii  iii and iv would be  and basis points  respectively 
for large institutions and large  highly complex institutions  the proposed rate schedule ranges from to basis points 
there are also adjustments made to the initial assessment rates based on long term unsecured debt  depository institution debt  and brokered deposits 
the bank s assessment rate reflected in its invoices for the quarters was basis points for each of average consolidated assets less average tangible equity 
the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the fdic determines  after a hearing  that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed in writing by  or written agreement with  the fdic 
the fdic may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital 
capital requirements the federal reserve and the fdic have issued substantially similar risk based and leverage capital guidelines that are applicable to the bank 
these guidelines require a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities such as standby letters of credit of 
at least half of the total required capital must be tier capital  consisting principally of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less certain goodwill items 
the remainder tier capital may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  cumulative perpetual preferred stock  and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  the bank is subject to a tier leverage capital ratio which requires a minimum level of tier capital to adjusted average assets of in the case of financial institutions that have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating significant growth or expansion 
all other institutions are expected to maintain a ratio of at least to above the stated minimum 
pursuant to the regulations  banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk  including the volume and severity of problem loans  to which they are exposed 
the dodd frank act requires the federal reserve to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository subsidiaries  provided  however  that bank holding companies with less than million in assets are exempt from these capital requirements 
the legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today  and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within months that take into account off balance sheet activities and risks  including risks related to securitized products and derivatives 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements  which shows that  at december   the bank s capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
at december   the bank was categorized as well capitalized 
banking regulators may change these requirements from time to time  depending on the economic outlook generally and the outlook for the banking industry 
the company is unable to predict whether and when higher capital requirements would be imposed and  if so  to what levels and on what schedule 
prompt corrective regulatory action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia requires  among other things  that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  fdicia establishes five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
at december   the bank was categorized as well capitalized  meaning that its total risk based capital ratio exceeded  its tier i risk based capital ratio exceeded  its leverage ratio exceeded  and it was not subject to a regulatory order  agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
the fdic may order institutions which have insufficient capital to take corrective actions  including  among other things  submitting a capital restoration plan  limiting asset growth  placing restrictions on activities  requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock including additional voting stock or to be acquired  restricting transactions with affiliates and prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt 
institutions deemed by the fdic to be critically undercapitalized would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
dividend limitations the holding company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the primary source of the holding company s cash flow  including cash flow to pay dividends on the holding company s common stock  is the payment of dividends to the holding company by the bank 
under indiana law  the bank may pay dividends of so much of its undivided profits generally  earnings less losses  bad debts  taxes and other operating expenses as is considered expedient by the bank s board of directors 
however  the bank must obtain the approval of the dfi for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the bank during the current year  including the proposed dividend  would exceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years 
for this purpose  retained net income means net income as calculated for call report purposes  less all dividends declared for the applicable period 
the fdic has the authority to prohibit the bank from paying dividends if  in its opinion  the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank 
in addition  under federal reserve supervisory policy  a bank holding company generally should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common shares unless i the organization s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and ii the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization s capital needs  assets  quality  and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve issued a letter dated february   to bank holding companies providing that it expects banks holding companies to consult with it in advance of declaring dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns ie  such as when the dividend is not supported by earnings or involves a material increase in the dividend rate and in advance of repurchasing shares of common or preferred stock 
loans to one borrower under indiana law  the bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of its unimpaired capital and surplus 
additional amounts may be lent  not in excess of of unimpaired capital and surplus  if such loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral  including certain debt and equity securities but not including real estate 
at december   the bank did not have any loans or extensions of credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of its lending limits 
acquisitions or dispositions and branching branching by the bank requires the approval of the dfi 
under current law  indiana chartered banks may establish branches throughout the state and in other states  subject to certain limitations 
congress authorized interstate branching  with certain limitations  beginning in indiana law authorizes an indiana bank to establish one or more branches in states other than indiana through interstate merger transactions and to establish one or more interstate branches through de novo branching or the acquisition of a branch 
the dodd frank act permits the establishment of de novo branches in states where such branches could be opened by a state bank chartered by that state 
the consent of the state is no longer required 
dodd frank act on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which significantly changes the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry 
the dodd frank act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike  including several provisions that will profoundly affect how community banks  thrifts  and small bank and thrift holding companies  such as river valley bancorp  will be regulated in the future 
among other things  these provisions abolish the office of thrift supervision the ots and transfer its functions to the other federal banking agencies  relax rules regarding interstate branching  allow financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts  change the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage  impose new capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies  and impose limits on debit card interchange fees charged by large banks commonly known as the durbin amendment 
the dodd frank act created a new  independent federal agency called the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb  which is granted broad rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws  including the equal credit opportunity act  truth in lending act  real estate settlement procedures act  fair credit reporting act  fair debt collection act  the consumer financial privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act  and certain other statutes 
in july  many of the consumer financial protection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies transferred to the cfbp 
the cfbp has a large budget and staff  and has the authority to implement regulations under federal consumer protection laws and enforce those laws against financial institutions 
the cfpb will have examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with billion or more in assets 
smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the cfpb but will continue to be examined and supervised by the federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes 
the cfpb will have authority to prevent unfair  deceptive or abusive practice in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 
additionally  this bureau is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations  engage in consumer financial education  track consumer complaints  request data  and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities 
moreover  the dodd frank act authorizes the cfpb to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower s ability to repay 
in addition  the dodd frank act will allow borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the cfpb 
the cfpb has indicated that mortgage lending is an area of supervisory focus and that it will concentrate its examination and rulemaking efforts on the variety of mortgage related topics required under the dodd frank act  including steering consumers to less favorable products  discrimination  abusive or unfair lending practices  predatory lending  origination disclosures  minimum mortgage underwriting standards  mortgage loan originator compensation  and servicing practices 
the cfpb recently published several final regulations impacting the mortgage industry  including rules related to ability to pay  mortgage servicing  escrow accounts  and mortgage loan originator compensation 
the ability to repay rule makes lenders liable if they fail to assess ability to repay under a prescribed test  but also creates a safe harbor for so called qualified mortgages 
the qualified mortgages standards include a tiered cap structure that places limits on the total amount of certain fees that can be charged on a loan  a cap on debt to income ie  total monthly payments on debt to monthly gross income  exclusion of interest only products  and other requirements 
the debt to income cap does not apply for the first seven years the rule is in effect for loans that are eligible for sale to fannie mae or freddie mac or eligible for government guarantee through the fha or the veterans administration 
failure to comply with the ability to repay rule may result in possible cfpb enforcement action and special statutory damages plus actual  class action  and attorneys fees damages  all of which a borrower may claim in defense of a foreclosure action at any time 
the company s management is currently assessing the impact of these requirements on its mortgage lending business 
in addition  the federal reserve and other federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a proposed rule under the dodd frank act that would exempt qualified residential mortgages from the securitization risk retention requirements of the dodd frank act 
the final definition of what constitutes a qualified residential mortgage may impact the pricing and depth of the secondary market into which we may sell mortgages we originate 
at this time  we cannot predict the content of final cfpb and other federal agency regulations or the impact they might have on the company s financial results 
the cfpb s authority over mortgage lending  and its authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators ie  regulations issued under the truth in lending act  for example  or to rescind or ignore past regulatory guidance  could increase the company s compliance costs and litigation exposure 
the january  decision of the dc circuit court of appeals invalidating recess appointments to the national labor relations board  calls into question the recess appointment of richard cordray as head of the cfpb 
what impact this potentially invalid appointment will have on the cfpb regulations promulgated in january  or actions taken prior to that time is undetermined at this time 
the decision may also play a part in determining whether new legislation will be passed respecting the structure and funding of the cfpb  and whether director cordray will be appointed when his current term expires 
though it is not possible to predict the outcome of the recess appointment controversy  the decision will have implications for the company and the bank with respect to regulations that apply to them and to competition from other entities that may or may not be subject to regulations promulgated by the cfpb the dodd frank act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types  many of which may have an impact on the operating environment of the company in substantial and unpredictable ways 
consequently  the dodd frank act is expected to increase our cost of doing business  it may limit or expand our permissible activities  and it may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas 
the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions  including as a result of the dodd frank act  is very unpredictable at this time 
the company s management continues to actively monitor the implementation of the dodd frank act and the regulations promulgated thereunder and assess its probable impact on the business  financial condition  and results of operations of the company 
however  the ultimate effect of the dodd frank act on the financial services industry in general  and the company in particular  remains uncertain 
interchange fees for debit cards under the dodd frank act  interchange fees for debit card transactions must be reasonable and proportional to the issuer s incremental cost incurred with respect to the transaction plus certain fraud related costs 
although institutions with total assets of less than billion are exempt from this requirement  competitive pressures may require smaller depository institutions to reduce fees with respect to these debit card transactions 
transactions with affiliates under indiana law  the bank is subject to sections h  a and b of the federal reserve act  which restrict financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies  such as the bancorp 
the statute limits credit transactions between a bank and its executive officers and its affiliates  prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices  and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank extension of credit to an affiliate 
federal securities law the shares of common stock of the holding company have been registered with the sec under the securities exchange act the act 
the holding company is subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the act and the rules of the sec thereunder 
if the holding company has fewer than shareholders  it may deregister its shares under the act and cease to be subject to the foregoing requirements 
shares of common stock held by persons who are affiliates of the holding company may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with the resale restrictions of rule under the securities act of if the holding company meets the current public information requirements under rule  each affiliate of the holding company who complies with the other conditions of rule including those that require the affiliate s sale to be aggregated with those of certain other persons would be able to sell in the public market  without registration  a number of shares not to exceed  in any three month period  the greater of i of the outstanding shares of the holding company or ii the average weekly volume of trading in such shares during the preceding four calendar weeks 
under the dodd frank act  beginning in  the holding company will be required to provide its shareholders an opportunity to vote on the executive compensation payable to its named executive officers and on golden parachute payments made in connection with mergers or acquisitions 
these votes will be non binding and advisory 
beginning in  the holding company must also permit shareholders to determine on an advisory basis whether such votes should be held every one  two  or three years 
community reinvestment act matters federal law requires that ratings of depository institutions under the community reinvestment act of cra be disclosed 
the disclosure includes both a four unit descriptive rating specifically  outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve  and substantial noncompliance and a written evaluation of an institution s performance 
each fhlb is required to establish standards of community investment or service that its members must maintain for continued access to long term advances from the fhlbs 
the standards take into account a member s performance under the cra and its record of lending to first time home buyers 
as of the date of its most recent regulatory examination  the bank was rated satisfactory with respect to its cra compliance 
other future legislation and change in regulations various other legislation  including proposals to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies  is from time to time introduced 
this legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the holding company and the bank in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions and other financial institutions 
the holding company cannot accurately predict whether any of this potential legislation will ultimately be enacted  and  if enacted  the ultimate effect that it  or implementing regulations  would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the holding company or the bank

under indiana law  the bank may pay dividends of so much of its undivided profits generally  earnings less losses  bad debts  taxes and other operating expenses as is considered expedient by the bank s board of directors 
however  the bank must obtain the approval of the indiana department of financial institutions for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the bank during the current year  including the proposed dividend  would exceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years 
for this purpose  retained net income means net income as calculated for call report purposes  less all dividends declared for the applicable period 
in addition  the bank may not pay a dividend if it would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account which was established for the purpose of granting a limited priority claim on the assets of river valley financial  in the event of a complete liquidation  to those members of river valley financial before its conversion from mutual to stock form who continue to maintain a savings account at river valley financial 
the fdic has the authority to prohibit the bank from paying dividends if  in its opinion  the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank 
any dividend distributions by the bank to the holding company in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a distribution from the bank s accumulated bad debt reserves  which could result in increased federal income tax liability for the bank 
since the holding company has no independent operation or other subsidiaries to generate income  its ability to accumulate earnings for the payment of cash dividends to its shareholders directly depends upon the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the holding company and upon the earnings on its investment securities 
generally  there is no federal reserve regulatory restriction on the payment of dividends by the holding company unless there is a determination by the federal reserve that there is reasonable cause to believe that the payment of dividends constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of the bank 
in addition  under federal reserve supervisory policy  a bank holding company generally should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common shares unless i the organization s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and ii the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization s capital needs  assets  quality  and overall financial condition 
however  the federal reserve issued a letter dated february   to bank holding companies providing that it expects banks holding companies to consult with it in advance of declaring dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns ie  such as when the dividend is not supported by earnings or involves a material increase in the dividend rate and in advance of repurchasing shares of common or preferred stock 
indiana law  moreover  would prohibit the holding company from paying a dividend  if  after giving effect to the payment of that dividend  the holding company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or the holding company s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus preferential rights of holders of preferred stock  if any 
in november  the company issued  shares of its fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a
