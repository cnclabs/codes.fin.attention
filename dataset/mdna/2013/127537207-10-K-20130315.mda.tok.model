item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

back to top c narrative description of business our business strategy is to pursue the development of our landholdings for their highest and best uses 
at present  our development activities include water resource  land and agricultural development 
water resource development our portfolio of water resources is located in proximity to the colorado river and the colorado river aqueduct cra  the principal source of imported water for southern california  and provides us with the opportunity to participate in a variety of water supply  water storage  and conservation programs with public agencies and other partners 
the cadiz valley water conservation  recovery and storage project we own approximately  acres of land and the subsurface strata  inclusive of the unsaturated soils and appurtenant water rights in the cadiz and fenner valleys of eastern san bernardino county the cadiz fenner property 
the aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation both rain and snow within a watershed of approximately  square miles 
see item  properties the cadiz fenner valley property 
the cadiz valley water conservation  recovery and storage project the water project or project is designed to supply  capture and conserve billions of gallons of renewable native groundwater currently being lost annually to evaporation from the aquifer system underlying our cadiz fenner property  and provide a reliable water supply to water users in southern california 
by implementing established groundwater management practices  the water project will create a new  sustainable water supply for project participants without adversely impacting the aquifer system or the desert environment 
the total quantity of groundwater to be recovered and conveyed to project participants will not exceed a long term annual average of  acre feet per year for years 
the project also offers participants the ability to carry over their annual supply  and store it in the groundwater basin from year to year 
a second phase of the project  phase ii  will offer approximately one million acre feet of storage capacity that can be used to store imported water supplies 
water project facilities required for phase i of the project primarily include  among other things high yield wells designed to efficiently recover available native groundwater from beneath the water project area  a mile water conveyance pipeline to deliver water from the well field to the cra  and an energy source to provide power to the well field  pipeline and pumping plant  
back to top if an imported water storage component of the project is ultimately implemented in phase ii  the following additional facilities would be required  among other things a pumping plant to pump water through the conveyance pipeline from the cra to the project well field  and spreading basins  which are shallow settling ponds that will be configured to efficiently percolate water from the ground surface down to the water table using subsurface storage capacity for the storage of water 
in general  several elements are needed to implement such a project a water conveyance pipeline right of way from the water project area to a delivery system  storage and supply agreements with one or more public water agencies or private water utilities  environmental regulatory permits  and construction and working capital financing 
as described below  the first three elements have been progressed on a concurrent basis 
the fourth is dependent on actions arising from the completion of the first three 
a water conveyance pipeline right of way from the water project area to a delivery system in september  we secured a right of way for the water project s water conveyance pipeline by entering into a lease agreement with the arizona california railroad company arzc 
the agreement allows for the use of a portion of the railroad s right of way to construct and operate a water conveyance pipeline for a period up to years 
the pipeline would be used to convey water between our cadiz valley property and the cra in rice  california 
as part of the lease agreement  the arzc would also receive water from the project for a variety of railroad purposes  including fire suppression and other safety and maintenance uses 
we are also exploring the potential to utilize an unused natural gas pipeline as described in overview above that exists in the project area  to which we hold an ownership right  as a means to access additional distribution systems 
initial feasibility studies indicate that this pipeline could be used as a component of the project to distribute water to project participants or import water for storage at the project area in phase ii 
the potential use of this pipeline by the project was preliminarily analyzed as part of the project s environmental impact report eir see other development opportunities 
storage and supply agreements with one or more public water agencies or private water utilities in and  we entered into option and environmental cost sharing agreements with six water providers santa margarita water district smwd  golden state water company a wholly owned subsidiary of american states water 
nyse awr  three valleys municipal water district  suburban water systems a wholly owned subsidiary of southwest water company  jurupa community services district and california water service company  the third largest investor owned american water utility 
the six water providers serve more than one million customers in cities throughout california s san bernardino  riverside  los angeles  orange and ventura counties 

back to top under the terms of the agreements with the six water providers  upon completion of the water project s ceqa review and certification of the final environmental impact report final eir  which occurred on july   each agency has the right to acquire an annual supply of  acre feet of water at a pre determined formula competitive with their incremental cost of new water 
in addition  the agencies have options to acquire storage rights in the water project to allow them to manage their supplies to complement their other water resources 
following ceqa certification  smwd was the first participant to adopt resolutions approving a water purchase and sale agreement for  acre fee of water 
the structure of the smwd purchase agreement calls for an annually adjusted water supply payment of up to af including identified income streams  plus their pro rata portion of the capital recovery charge and operating and maintenance costs 
the capital recovery charge is calculated by amortizing the total capital investment by the company over a year term 
approximately of the water to be conserved annually by the project is now either under a water purchase and sale agreement or remains under option 
we are currently working with the other participating agencies to convert their option agreements to definitive economic agreements 
we are also in discussions with additional water providers interested in acquiring rights to the remaining available project supplies  as well as with third parties regarding the imported storage aspect of this project 
environmental permits in order to properly develop and quantify the sustainability of the water project  and prior to initiating the formal permitting process for the water project  we commissioned environmental consulting firm chm hill to complete a comprehensive study of the water resources at the project area 
following a year of analysis  chm hill released its study of the aquifer system in february utilizing new models produced by the us geological survey in and  the study estimated the total groundwater in storage in the aquifer system to be between and million acre feet  a quantity on par with lake mead  the nation s largest surface reservoir 
the study also identified a renewable annual supply of native groundwater in the aquifer system currently being lost to evaporation 
chm hill s findings  which were peer reviewed by leading groundwater experts  confirmed that the aquifer system could sustainably support the water project 
further  and also prior to beginning the formal environmental permitting process  we entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the natural heritage institute nhi  a leading global environmental organization committed to protecting aquatic ecosystems  to assist with our efforts to sustainably manage the development of our cadiz fenner property 
as part of this green compact  we will follow stringent plans for groundwater management and habitat conservation  and create a groundwater management plan for the water project 
as discussed in  above  we have entered into environmental cost sharing agreements with all participating water providers 
the environmental cost sharing agreements created a framework for funds to be committed by each participant to share in the costs associated with the ceqa review work 
smwd served as the lead agency for the review process 
esa associates  a leading environmental consulting firm  prepared the water project s environmental review documentation 

back to top the ceqa process began in february with the issuance of a notice of preparation nop of a draft environmental impact report draft eir by smwd 
smwd held two public scoping meetings in march and released the draft eir in december the draft eir analyzed potential impacts to environmental resources at the project area  including critical resources of the desert environment such as vegetation  mountain springs  and water and air quality 
the analysis of the project considered peer reviewed technical reports  independently collected data  existing reports and the project s state of the art groundwater management  monitoring and mitigation plan gmmmp 
smwd conducted a day public comment period for the draft eir  hosting two public comment meetings and an informational workshop in january and february the public comment period concluded in march in may  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the county and smwd  creating the framework for finalizing the gmmmp in accordance with the county s desert groundwater ordinance 
at the beginning of july  smwd released the final eir and responses to public comments 
the final eir summarized that  with the exception of unavoidable short term construction emissions  by implementing the measures developed in the gmmmp  the project will avoid significant impacts to desert resources 
a public hearing was held on july  by the smwd board of directors to take public testimony and consider certification of the final eir 
on july   the smwd board of directors certified the final eir 
following smwd s certification of the final eir  the san bernardino county board of supervisors voted on october  to approve the gmmmp for the project and adopted certain findings under ceqa  becoming the first responsible agency to take an approving action pursuant to the certified eir 
san bernardino county served as a responsible agency in the ceqa review process as the local government entity responsible for oversight over groundwater resources in the cadiz valley 
metropolitan  also a responsible agency  will take action under ceqa prior to construction regarding the terms and conditions of the project s use of the cra 
project water supplies will enter metropolitan s cra in accordance with its published engineering and design standards and subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory 
construction and working capital as part of the water purchase and sale agreement with smwd referred to in  above  smwd is further authorized to continue next steps with the company  which includes final permitting  design and construction 
as described above  construction of phase i of the project would primarily consist of wellfield facilities at the water project site  a conveyance pipeline extending approximately miles along the right of way described in  above  from the wellfield to the cra  and an energy source to pump water through the conveyance pipeline between the project well field and the cra 
the construction of these facilities will require capital financing  which is expected to be entirely provided with lower cost senior debt  secured by the new facility assets 
the march refinancing of the company s corporate term debt see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources now provides us the flexibility to incorporate water project construction financing within our current debt structure 

back to top existing wells at the cadiz valley property currently in use for our agricultural operations will be integrated into the water project well field  reducing the number of wells that must be constructed prior to project implementation 
these wells will be upgraded from diesel power to natural gas power over the next months to advance the overall construction timeline 
existing pipeline asset as described above see general development of the business  we currently hold ownership rights to a mile existing idle natural gas pipeline from the cadiz valley to barstow  california that would be converted for the transportation of water 
in september  we entered into two separate agreements with el paso natural gas epng  a subsidiary of kinder morgan inc  and questar corporation questar providing us with options to purchase approximately miles of idle  natural gas pipelines for million 
the questar agreement granted us rights to purchase an mile line in riverside county for million 
based on our evaluation of these lines we allowed the option agreement with questar to expire and we pursued plans for the epng line as described below 
the option agreement with epng granted us rights to purchase a mile pipeline between bakersfield and cadiz  california for million 
initial feasibility studies indicated that upon conversion the inch line could transport between  and  acre feet of water per year between the water project area and various points along the central and northern california water transportation network 
in february  we made a million payment to epng to extend our option to purchase the mile line until april in december  we entered into a new agreement with epng dividing the mile pipeline in barstow  california  with the company gaining ownership rights to the mile eastern segment between barstow and the cadiz valley and returning to epng rights to the mile western segment for its own use 
the mile eastern portion from the cadiz valley to barstow was identified as the most critical segment of the line for accessing the state s water transportation infrastructure 
the barstow area serves as a hub for water delivered from northern and central california to communities in southern california s high desert 
in consideration of the new agreement  epng reduced the purchase price of the mile eastern segment to a nominal amount of one dollar  plus previous option payments totaling million already made by cadiz 
the remaining purchase price of one dollar is payable before expiration of the option period in april in addition  if epng files for regulatory approval of any new use of the mile western segment by december  epng will make an additional payment to the company of million  payable on the date the application for regulatory approval is filed 

back to top the mile cadiz barstow creates significant opportunities for our water resource development efforts 
once converted to water use  the pipeline can be used to directly connect the cadiz area to northern and central california water sources  serving a growing need for additional locations for storage of water south of the bay delta region 
in addition  the mile pipeline creates new opportunities to deliver water  either directly or via exchange  to potential customers in san bernardino and kern counties  areas which do not currently have an interconnection point with the project 
when both the mile line and the mile pipeline to the cra become operational  cadiz would link the two major water delivery systems in california providing flexible opportunities for both supply and storage 
the entire epng pipeline was evaluated in the water project s eir during the ceqa process at a programmatic level 
any use of the line would be conducted in conformity with the project s gmmmp and is subject to further ceqa evaluation see cadiz valley water conservation  recovery and storage project above 
agricultural development within the cadiz fenner property   acres have been zoned for agriculture 
the infrastructure currently includes seven wells that are interconnected within a portion of this acreage  with total annual production capacity of approximately  acre feet of water 
additionally  there are housing and kitchen facilities that support up to employees 
if the entire  acres were developed and irrigated  total water usage would be approximately   acre feet per year depending on the crop mix 
the underlying groundwater  fertile soil  and desert temperatures are well suited for a wide variety of fruits and vegetables 
permanent crops currently include acres of vineyard used to produce dried on the vine raisins and acres of lemon orchards 
both of these crops are farmed using sustainable agricultural practices 
we currently derive our agricultural revenues through the sale of our products in bulk or through independent packing facilities 
we incur all of the costs necessary to produce and harvest our organic raisin crop 
these raisins are then sold in bulk to a raisin processing facility 
we also incur all of the costs necessary to produce our lemon crop 
once harvested  the lemons are shipped in bulk to a packing and sales facility 
in  we entered into a lease agreement with a third party to develop additional acres of lemon orchards  approximately one half of the new orchard acreage has been planted to date 
we expect to receive lease income once the new lemon orchards reach commercial production through a profit sharing agreement within the lease 
agricultural revenues will continue to vary from year to year based on the number of acres in development  crop yields  and prices 
we do not expect that our agricultural revenues are likely to be material to our overall results of operations once the water project is fully operational 
however  our agricultural operations are expected to be maintained in complement with the water project to provide added value to project operations 
additional eastern mojave properties we also own approximately  acres outside of the cadiz fenner valley area in other parts of the mojave desert in eastern san bernardino county 

back to top our primary landholding outside of the cadiz area is approximately  acres in the piute valley 
this landholding is located approximately miles from the resort community of laughlin  nevada  and about miles from the colorado river town of needles  california 
extensive hydrological studies  including the drilling and testing of a full scale production well  have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high quality groundwater 
the aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation both rain and snow within a watershed of approximately square miles and could be suitable for a water supply project  agricultural development or solar energy production 
certain of these properties are located in or adjacent to areas designated by the federal government as critical desert tortoise habitat and or desert wilderness areas and are also suitable candidates for preservation and conservation 
additionally  we own acreage located near danby dry lake  approximately miles southeast of our cadiz fenner valley properties 
the danby dry lake property is located approximately miles north of the cra 
initial hydrological studies indicate that the area has excellent potential for a water supply project 
certain of the properties in this area may also be suitable for agricultural development and or preservation and conservation 
land conservation bank as stated above  approximately  acres of our properties not currently being developed are located within areas designated by the federal government as critical desert tortoise habitat and or desert wilderness areas 
we are currently exploring the potential to make certain of these properties available in a land mitigation or conservation bank  which would provide credits that can be acquired by entities that must acquire land to mitigate or offset impactful development in other areas 
for example  this bank could potentially service the mitigation requirements of numerous utility scale solar development projects being considered throughout riverside and san bernardino counties  including projects within the recently approved federal riverside east solar energy zone 
other opportunities over the longer term  we believe the population of southern california  nevada and arizona will continue to grow  and that  in time  the economics of commercial and residential development or solar energy generation at our properties may become attractive 
moreover  other opportunities in business or infrastructure complementary to our current objectives could provide new opportunities for our business 
we remain committed to the sustainable use of our land and water assets  and will continue to explore all opportunities for environmentally responsible development of these assets 
we cannot predict with certainty which of these various opportunities will ultimately be utilized 
seasonality our water resource development activities are not seasonal in nature 
our farming operations are limited to the cultivation of lemons and grapes raisins and spring and fall plantings of vegetables on the cadiz valley properties 
these operations are subject to the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry 

back to top competition we face competition for the acquisition  development and sale of our properties from a number of competitors 
we may also face competition in the development of water resources and siting of renewable energy facilities associated with our properties 
since california has scarce water resources and an increasing demand for available water  we believe that location  price and reliability of delivery are the principal competitive factors affecting transfers of water in california 
employees as of december   we employed full time employees ie those individuals working more than  hours per year 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
regulation our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local laws and regulations 
as we proceed with the development of our properties  including the water project  we will be required to satisfy various regulatory authorities that we are in compliance with the laws  regulations and policies enforced by such authorities 
groundwater development  and the export of surplus groundwater for sale to entities such as public water agencies  is subject to regulation by specific existing statutes  in addition to general environmental statutes applicable to all development projects 
additionally  we must obtain a variety of approvals and permits from state and federal governments with respect to issues that may include environmental issues  issues related to special status species  issues related to the public trust  and others 
because of the discretionary nature of these approvals and concerns  which may be raised by various governmental officials  public interest groups and other interested parties during both the development and the approval process  our ability to develop properties and realize income from our projects  including the water project  could be delayed  reduced or eliminated 
access to our information our annual  quarterly and current reports  proxy statements and other information are filed with the securities and exchange commission sec and are available free of charge through our web site  www

risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks  including those described below 
our development activities have not generated significant revenues at present  our development activities include water resource  agricultural and solar energy development at our san bernardino county properties 
we have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date and we do not know when  if ever  we will receive operating revenues sufficient to offset the costs of our development activities 
as a result  we continue to incur a net loss from operations 
we may never generate significant revenues or become profitable unless we are able to successfully implement programs to develop our land assets and related water resources we do not know the terms  if any  upon which we may be able to proceed with our water and other development programs 
regardless of the form of our water development programs  the circumstances under which supplies or storage of water can be developed and the profitability of any supply or storage project are subject to significant uncertainties  including the risk of variable water supplies and changing water allocation priorities 
additional risks include our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and permits  litigation by environmental or other groups  unforeseen technical difficulties  general market conditions for water supplies  and the time needed to generate significant operating revenues from such programs after operations commence 
the development of our properties is heavily regulated  requires governmental approvals and permits that could be denied  and may have competing governmental interests and objectives in developing our land assets and related water resources  we are subject to local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  resource protection  environmental impacts  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  construction and similar matters 
our development activities are subject to the risk of adverse interpretations or changes to us federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies 
further  our development activities require governmental approvals and permits 
if such permits were to be denied or granted subject to unfavorable conditions or restrictions  our ability to successfully implement our development programs would be adversely impacted 
the opposition of government officials may adversely affect our ability to obtain needed government approvals and permits upon satisfactory terms in a timely manner 
in this regard  federal government appropriations currently preclude spending for any proposal to store water for the purpose of export or for any activities associated with the approval of rights of way on lands managed by the needles field office of the us bureau of land management the blm 
federal government appropriations also direct the us department of the interior the doi to confirm that the water project s proposed use of a portion of arzc s for its conveyance pipeline is within the scope of arzc s right of way 
according to existing federal law and direction from the doi in memorandum opinion m a railroad has the authority to grant third party uses within its rights of way without blm approval if those uses will serve a railroad purpose 
the project and pipeline will further numerous railroad purposes  including fire suppression and access to water for railroad business operations  and the arzc has provided information regarding these purposes to the blm 
as a result  we do not believe federal right of way approval is required to implement the project  however  this may be subject to challenge 

back to top additionally  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge proposed plans and approvals 
opposition from third parties will cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely 
in california  third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
we are currently named as a real party in interest in eight lawsuits challenging the various water project approvals granted to date and expect to be party to various legal proceedings arising in the general course of our business related to the development of the water project 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental and third party interests and agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects  certain groups may remain opposed to our development plans 
our failure to make timely payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness may result in a foreclosure on our assets as of december   we had indebtedness outstanding to our senior secured lenders of approximately million 
this debt was refinanced in march see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  and remains secured by our assets 
to the extent that we do not make principal and interest payments on the indebtedness when due in  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness  we may default on our obligations 
the conversion of our outstanding convertible bonds into common stock would dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders in connection with our debt refinance see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  we issued approximately million in bonds the convertible bonds principal and accrued interest under the convertible bonds can be converted into common stock at per share at the election of our lenders 
an election by our lenders to convert all or a portion of principal and accrued interest under these convertible bonds into common stock will dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders up to million shares as of march   and up to an additional million shares if held to maturity 

back to top we may not be able to obtain the financing we need to implement our asset development programs based upon our current and anticipated usage of cash resources  we have sufficient funds to meet our expected working capital needs until mid we will continue to require additional working capital to meet our cash resource needs until such time as our asset development programs produce revenues 
if we cannot raise funds if and when needed  we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses  which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company 
we cannot assure you that our current lenders  or any other lenders  will give us additional credit should we seek it 
if we are unable to obtain additional credit  we may engage in further financings 
our ability to obtain financing will depend  among other things  on the status of our asset development programs and general conditions in the capital markets at the time funding is sought 
although we currently expect our capital sources to be sufficient to meet our near term liquidity needs  there can be no assurance that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied 
any further equity or convertible debt financings would result in the dilution of ownership interests of our current stockholders 
the issuance of equity securities under management equity incentive plans will impact earnings our compensation programs for management emphasize long term incentives  primarily through the issuance of equity securities and options to purchase equity securities 
it is expected that plans involving the issuance of shares  options  or both will be submitted from time to time to our stockholders for approval 
in the event that any such plans are approved and implemented  the issuance of shares and options under such plans may result in the dilution of the ownership interest of other stockholders and will  under currently applicable accounting rules  result in a charge to earnings based on the value of our common stock at the time of issue and the fair value of options at the time of their award 
the expense would be recorded over the vesting period of each stock and option grant

unresolved staff comments not applicable at this time 
item properties following is a description of our significant properties 
the cadiz fenner valley property since  we have acquired approximately  acres of largely contiguous land in the cadiz and fenner valleys of eastern san bernardino county  california the cadiz fenner property 
this area is located approximately miles north of the colorado river aqueduct cra 
in  we conducted investigations of the feasibility of agricultural development of this land 
these investigations confirmed the availability of high quality groundwater in quantities appropriate for agricultural development 
additional independent geotechnical and engineering studies conducted since have confirmed that the cadiz fenner property overlies an aquifer system that is ideally suited for the conservation  recovery and delivery of indigenous groundwater  as well as the storage of conserved or imported water  as contemplated by the water project 
see item  business narrative description of business water resource development

overview we are a land and water resource development company with  acres of land in three areas of eastern san bernardino county  california 
virtually all of this land is underlain by high quality  naturally recharging groundwater resources  and is situated in proximity to the colorado river and the colorado river aqueduct cra  the major source of imported water for southern california 
our main objective is to realize the highest and best use of these land and water resources in an environmentally responsible way 
for more than years  we have maintained an agricultural development at our  acre property in the cadiz valley  relying upon groundwater from the underlying aquifer system for irrigation 
in  we secured permits to develop agriculture on up to  acres of the cadiz valley property and withdraw more than one million acre feet of groundwater from the underlying aquifer system 
since that time  we have maintained various levels of agriculture at the property and this operation has provided our principal source of revenue 
in addition to our sustainable agricultural operations  we believe that the long term value of our land assets can best be derived through the development of a combination of water supply and storage projects at our properties 
the primary factors that drive the value of such projects are continued population growth and sustained pressure on water supplies throughout california  including environmental restrictions and regulatory shortages on each of the state s three primary water sources the state water project  the colorado river and the los angeles aqueduct 
southern california s water providers rely on these imported sources for a majority of their water supplies  but deliveries from all three systems have been below capacity over the last several years 
availability of supplies in california also differs greatly from year to year due to natural hydrological variability 
for example  state water project deliveries are presently limited to just of capacity from due to ongoing environmental restrictions and below average precipitation 
with the region s population expected to continue to grow  southern california water providers are seeking new  reliable supply solutions to address anticipated limitations of traditional water supplies and to plan for long term water needs 

back to top at present  our water development efforts are primarily focused on the cadiz valley water conservation  recovery and storage project water project or project  which will capture and conserve millions of acre feet of native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system beneath our cadiz valley property and deliver it to water providers throughout southern california see water resource development 
we believe that the ultimate implementation of this water project will create the primary source of our future cash flow and  accordingly  our working capital requirements relate largely to the development activities associated with this water project 
we also continue to explore additional uses of our land and water resource assets  including additional agricultural opportunities  renewable energy power generation opportunities  and the development of a land conservation bank on our properties outside the water project area 
in addition to these development efforts  we will also pursue strategic investments in complementary business or infrastructure to meet our objectives 
we cannot predict with certainty when or if these objectives will be realized 
water resource development the water project is designed to supply  capture and conserve billions of gallons of renewable native groundwater currently being lost annually to evaporation from the aquifer system underlying our cadiz fenner property  and provide a reliable water supply to water users in southern california 
by implementing established groundwater management practices  the water project will create a new  sustainable water supply for project participants without adversely impacting the aquifer system or the desert environment 
the total quantity of groundwater to be recovered and conveyed to project participants will not exceed a long term annual average of  acre feet per year for years 
the project also offers participants the ability to carry over their annual supply and store it in the groundwater basin from year to year 
a second phase of the project  phase ii  will offer approximately one million acre feet of storage capacity that can be used to store imported water supplies 
water project facilities required for phase i of the project primarily include  among other things high yield wells designed to efficiently recover available native groundwater from beneath the water project area  a mile water conveyance pipeline to deliver water from the well field to the cra  and an energy source to provide power to the well field  pipeline and pumping plant 
if an imported water storage component of the project is ultimately implemented in phase ii  the following additional facilities would be required  among other things a pumping plant to pump water through the conveyance pipeline from the cra to the project well field  and spreading basins  which are shallow settling ponds that will be configured to efficiently percolate water from the ground surface down to the water table using subsurface storage capacity for the storage of water 

back to top in general  several elements are needed to implement such a project a water conveyance pipeline right of way from the water project area to a delivery system  storage and supply agreements with one or more public water agencies or private water utilities  environmental regulatory permits  and construction and working capital financing 
as described below  the first three elements have been progressed on a concurrent basis 
the fourth is dependent on actions arising from the completion of the first three 
a water conveyance pipeline right of way from the water project area to a delivery system in september  we secured a right of way for the water project s water conveyance pipeline by entering into a lease agreement with the arizona california railroad company arzc 
the agreement allows for the use of a portion of the railroad s right of way to construct and operate a water conveyance pipeline for a period up to years 
the pipeline would be used to convey water between our cadiz valley property and the cra in rice  california 
as part of the lease agreement  the arzc would also receive water from the project for a variety of railroad purposes  including fire suppression and other safety and maintenance uses 
we are also exploring the potential to utilize an unused natural gas pipeline as described in overview above that exists in the project area  to which we hold an ownership right  as a means to access additional distribution systems 
initial feasibility studies indicate that this pipeline could be used as a component of the project to distribute water to project participants or import water for storage at the project area in phase ii 
the potential use of this pipeline by the project was preliminarily analyzed as part of the project s environmental impact report eir see other development opportunities 
storage and supply agreements with one or more public water agencies or private water utilities in and  we entered into option and environmental cost sharing agreements with six water providers santa margarita water district smwd  golden state water company a wholly owned subsidiary of american states water 
nyse awr  three valleys municipal water district  suburban water systems a wholly owned subsidiary of southwest water company  jurupa community services district and california water service company  the third largest investor owned american water utility 
the six water providers serve more than one million customers in cities throughout california s san bernardino  riverside  los angeles  orange and ventura counties 
under the terms of the agreements with the six water providers  upon completion of the water project s ceqa review and certification of the final environmental impact report final eir  which occurred on july   each agency has the right to acquire an annual supply of  acre feet of water at a pre determined formula competitive with their incremental cost of new water 
in addition  the agencies have options to acquire storage rights in the water project to allow them to manage their supplies to complement their other water resources 
following ceqa certification  smwd was the first participant to adopt resolutions approving a water purchase and sale agreement for  acre fee of water 
the structure of the smwd purchase agreement calls for an annually adjusted water supply payment of up to af including identified income streams  plus their pro rata portion of the capital recovery charge and operating and maintenance costs 
the capital recovery charge is calculated by amortizing the total capital investment by the company over a year term 

back to top approximately of the water to be conserved annually by the project is now either under a water purchase and sale agreement or remains under option 
we are currently working with other participating agencies to convert their option agreements to definitive economic agreements 
we are also in discussions with additional water providers interested in acquiring rights to the remaining available project supplies  as well as with third parties regarding the imported storage aspect of this project 
environmental permits in order to properly develop and quantify the sustainability of the water project  and prior to initiating the formal permitting process for the water project  we commissioned environmental consulting firm chm hill to complete a comprehensive study of the water resources at the project area 
following a year of analysis  chm hill released its study of the aquifer system in february utilizing new models produced by the us geological survey in and  the study estimated the total groundwater in storage in the aquifer system to be between and million acre feet  a quantity on par with lake mead  the nation s largest surface reservoir 
the study also identified a renewable annual supply of native groundwater in the aquifer system currently being lost to evaporation 
chm hill s findings  which were peer reviewed by leading groundwater experts  confirmed that the aquifer system could sustainably support the water project 
further  and also prior to beginning the formal environmental permitting process  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the natural heritage institute nhi  a leading global environmental organization committed to protecting aquatic ecosystems  to assist with our efforts to sustainably manage the development of our cadiz fenner property 
as part of this green compact  we will follow stringent plans for groundwater management and habitat conservation  and create a groundwater management plan for the water project 
as discussed in  above  we have entered into environmental cost sharing agreements with all participating water providers 
the environmental cost sharing agreements created a framework for funds to be committed by each participant to share in the costs associated with the ceqa review work 
smwd served as the lead agency for the review process 
esa associates  a leading environmental consulting firm  prepared the water project s environmental review documentation 
the ceqa process began in february with the issuance of a notice of preparation nop of a draft environmental impact report draft eir by smwd 
smwd held two public scoping meetings in march and released the draft eir in december the draft eir analyzed potential impacts to environmental resources at the project area  including critical resources of the desert environment such as vegetation  mountain springs  and water and air quality 
the analysis of the project considered peer reviewed technical reports  independently collected data  existing reports and the project s state of the art groundwater management  monitoring and mitigation plan gmmmp 

back to top smwd conducted a day public comment period for the draft eir  hosting two public comment meetings and an informational workshop in january and february the public comment period concluded in march in may  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the county and smwd  creating the framework for finalizing the gmmmp in accordance with the county s desert groundwater ordinance 
at the beginning of july  smwd released the final eir and responses to public comments 
the final eir summarized that  with the exception of unavoidable short term construction emissions  by implementing the measures developed in the gmmmp  the project will avoid significant impacts to desert resources 
a public hearing was held on july  by the smwd board of directors to take public testimony and consider certification of the final eir 
on july   the smwd board of directors certified the final eir 
following smwd s certification of the final eir  the san bernardino county board of supervisors voted on october  to approve the gmmmp for the project and adopted certain findings under ceqa  becoming the first responsible agency to take an approving action pursuant to the certified eir 
san bernardino county served as a responsible agency in the ceqa review process as the local government entity responsible for oversight over groundwater resources in the cadiz valley 
metropolitan water district of southern california metropolitan  also a responsible agency  will take action under ceqa prior to construction regarding the terms and conditions of the project s use of the cra 
project water supplies will enter metropolitan s cra in accordance with its published engineering and design standards and subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory 
construction and working capital as part of the water purchase and sale agreement with smwd referred to in  above  smwd further authorized to continue next steps with the company  which includes final permitting  design and construction 
as described above  construction of phase i of the project would primarily consist of well field facilities at the water project site  a conveyance pipeline extending approximately miles along the right of way described in  above  from the well field to the cra  and an energy source to pump water through the conveyance pipeline between the project well field and the cra 
the construction of these facilities will require capital financing  which is expected to be entirely provided with lower cost senior debt  secured by the new facility assets 
the march refinancing of our corporate term debt see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  now provides us the flexibility to incorporate water project construction financing within our current debt structure 
existing wells at the cadiz valley property currently in use for our agricultural operations will be integrated into the water project well field  reducing the number of wells that must be constructed prior to project implementation 
these wells will be upgraded from diesel power to natural gas power over the next months to advance the overall construction timeline 

back to top existing pipeline asset we currently hold ownership rights to a mile existing idle natural gas pipeline from the cadiz valley to barstow  california that would be converted for the transportation of water 
in september  we entered into two separate agreements with el paso natural gas epng  a subsidiary of kinder morgan inc  and questar corporation questar providing us with options to purchase approximately miles of idle  natural gas pipelines for million 
the questar agreement granted us rights to purchase an mile line in riverside county for million 
based on our evaluation of these lines we allowed the option agreement with questar to expire and we pursued plans for the epng line as described below 
the option agreement with epng granted us rights to purchase a mile pipeline between bakersfield and cadiz  california for million 
initial feasibility studies indicated that upon conversion the inch line could transport between  and  acre feet of water per year between the water project area and various points along the central and northern california water transportation network 
in february  we made a million payment to epng to extend our option to purchase the mile line until april in december  we entered into a new agreement with epng dividing the mile pipeline in barstow  california  with the company gaining ownership rights to the mile eastern segment between barstow and the cadiz valley and returning to epng rights to the mile western segment for its own use 
the mile eastern portion from the cadiz valley to barstow was identified as the most critical segment of the line for accessing the state s water transportation infrastructure 
the barstow area serves as a hub for water delivered from northern and central california to communities in southern california s high desert 
in consideration of the new agreement  epng reduced the purchase price of the mile eastern segment to a nominal amount of one dollar  plus previous option payments totaling million already made by cadiz 
the remaining purchase price of one dollar is payable before expiration of the option period in april in addition  if epng files for regulatory approval of any new use of the mile western segment by december  epng will make an additional payment to the company of million  payable on the date the application for regulatory approval is filed 
the mile cadiz barstow creates significant opportunities for our water resource development efforts 
once converted to water use  the pipeline can be used to directly connect the cadiz area to northern and central california water sources  serving a growing need for additional locations for storage of water south of the bay delta region 
in addition  the mile pipeline creates new opportunities to deliver water  either directly or via exchange  to potential customers in san bernardino and kern counties  areas which do not currently have an interconnection point with the project 
when both the mile line and the mile pipeline to the cra become operational  cadiz would link the two major water delivery systems in california providing flexible opportunities for both supply and storage 
the entire epng pipeline was evaluated in the water project s eir during the ceqa process at a programmatic level 
any use of the line would be conducted in conformity with the project s gmmmp and is subject to further ceqa evaluation see water resource development above 

back to top agricultural development within the cadiz fenner property   acres have been zoned for agriculture 
the infrastructure currently includes seven wells that are interconnected within a portion of this acreage  with total annual production capacity of approximately  acre feet of water 
additionally  there are housing and kitchen facilities that support up to employees 
if the entire  acres were developed and irrigated  total water usage would be approximately   acre feet per year depending on the crop mix 
the underlying groundwater  fertile soil  and desert temperatures are well suited for a wide variety of fruits and vegetables 
permanent crops currently include acres of vineyard used to produce dried on the vine raisins and acres of lemon orchards 
both of these crops are farmed using sustainable agricultural practices 
we currently derive our agricultural revenues through the sale of our products in bulk or through independent packing facilities 
we incur all of the costs necessary to produce and harvest our organic raisin crop 
these raisins are then sold in bulk to a raisin processing facility 
we also incur all of the costs necessary to produce our lemon crop 
once harvested  the lemons are shipped in bulk to a packing and sales facility 
in  we entered into a lease agreement with a third party to develop additional acres of lemon orchards  approximately one half of the new orchard acreage has been planted to date 
we expect to receive lease income once the new lemon orchards reach commercial production through a profit sharing agreement within the lease 
agricultural revenues will continue to vary from year to year based on the number of acres in development  crop yields  and prices 
we do not expect that our agricultural revenues are likely to be material to our overall results of operations once the water project is fully operational 
however  our agricultural operations are expected to be maintained in complement with the water project to provide added value to project operations 
additional eastern mojave properties we also own approximately  acres outside of the cadiz fenner valley area in other parts of the mojave desert in eastern san bernardino county 
our primary landholding outside of the cadiz area is approximately  acres in the piute valley 
this landholding is located approximately miles from the resort community of laughlin  nevada  and about miles from the colorado river town of needles  california 
extensive hydrological studies  including the drilling and testing of a full scale production well  have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high quality groundwater 
the aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation both rain and snow within a watershed of approximately square miles and could be suitable for a water supply project  agricultural development or solar energy production 
certain of these properties are located in or adjacent to areas designated by the federal government as critical desert tortoise habitat and or desert wilderness areas and are suitable candidates for preservation and conservation 

back to top additionally  we own acreage located near danby dry lake  approximately miles southeast of our cadiz fenner valley properties 
the danby dry lake property is located approximately miles north of the cra 
initial hydrological studies indicate that the area has excellent potential for a water supply project 
certain of the properties in this area may also be suitable for agricultural development and or preservation and conservation 
land conservation bank as stated above  approximately  acres of our properties not currently being developed are located within areas designated by the federal government as critical desert tortoise habitat and or desert wilderness areas 
we are currently exploring the potential to make certain of these properties available in a land mitigation or conservation bank  which would provide credits that can be acquired by entities that must acquire land to mitigate or offset impactful development in other areas 
for example  this bank could potentially service the mitigation requirements of numerous utility scale solar development projects being considered throughout riverside and san bernardino counties  including projects within the recently approved federal riverside east solar energy zone 
other opportunities over the longer term  we believe the population of southern california  nevada and arizona will continue to grow  and that  in time  the economics of commercial and residential development or solar energy generation at our properties may become attractive 
moreover  other opportunities in business or infrastructure complementary to our current objectives could provide new opportunities for our business 
we remain committed to the sustainable use of our land and water assets  and will continue to explore all opportunities for environmentally responsible development of these assets 
we cannot predict with certainty which of these various opportunities will ultimately be utilized 
results of operations a year ended december  compared to year ended december  we have not received significant revenues from our water resource and real estate development activity to date 
our revenues have been limited to our agricultural operations 
as a result  we continue to incur a loss from operations 
we had revenues of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the net loss totaled million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  the higher loss was primarily due to additional legal and consulting fees related to water development efforts in connection with the certification of the final environmental impact report  litigation costs and due diligence costs associated with the feasibility of converting the natural gas pipelines  which we currently have an ownership right  to water transportation facilities see existing pipeline asset above 
our primary expenses are our ongoing overhead costs ie  general and administrative expense and our interest expense 
we will continue to incur non cash expenses in connection with our management and director equity incentive compensation plans 

back to top revenues 
revenue totaled million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  revenues included million of revenues related to citrus crop sales  which were down million from the prior year due to significant weather related damage to citrus crops in the growing season  and million of revenues related to raisin sales  which were up million from the prior year primarily due to a larger raisin crop in in comparison to the raisin crop 
cost of sales 
cost of sales totaled million during the year ended december   compared with million during the year ended december  the lower cost of sales for the year ended december   related largely to the lower lemon harvesting related to the smaller size of the lemon crop which was due to significant weather related damage 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   totaled million compared with million for the year ended december  non cash compensation costs related to stock and option awards are included in general and administrative expenses 
compensation costs from stock and option awards for the year ended december   totaled million compared with million for the year ended december  the expense reflects the vesting schedules of the stock and option awards under the equity incentive plan 
other general and administrative expenses  exclusive of stock based compensation costs  totaled million in the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to additional legal and consulting fees related to water development efforts in connection with the certification of the final environmental impact report  litigation costs and due diligence costs associated with the feasibility of converting the natural gas pipelines  which we currently have an ownership right  to water transportation facilities see existing pipeline asset above

back to top the interest on outstanding debt increased from million to million due to the increase in debt outstanding under our new working capital facility in prior debt refinancings 
deferred loan costs  which are primarily legal fees  are amortized over the life of each loan agreement 
in june  we refinanced our term loan with ing capital llc ing with a new senior secured convertible term loan with a different lender 
as a result  thousand of legal fees was capitalized and is amortized over the year life of the loan agreement 
an additional thousand of lender fees was capitalized when the term loan was modified in october these fees are amortized over the remaining life of the term loan 
in june and october  the term loan was modified as to certain of its conversion features 
as a result of these convertible debt arrangements  the change in conversion value between the original and modified instrument totaled approximately million  which was recorded as additional debt discount with a corresponding amount recorded as additional paid in capital 
such debt discount is accreted to the redemption value of the instrument over the remaining term of the loan as additional interest expense 
in connection with the modification transaction in october  we recorded a derivative liability related to the conversion option 
the fair value of the derivative liability was marked to market at the end of each reporting period with the associated change in fair value recorded as other income expense 
on july   we entered into an amendment to the facility eliminating the availability to the company of the unused million portion of the facility 
as a result  the conversion option related to the unused portion of the facility no longer exists and a derivative liability is no longer being recorded 
on october   we increased the capacity of the term loan with an additional million facility 
as a result of this transaction  an additional thousand of lender fees was capitalized and is amortized over the remaining term of the loan 
concurrently with the funding of the facility  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase shares of common stock 
the value of the warrants totaled approximately thousand and was recorded as additional debt discount with a corresponding amount recorded as additional paid in capital 
b year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had revenues of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the net loss totaled million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  the higher loss was primarily due to additional legal and consulting fees related to water development efforts and higher net interest expense  partially offset by lower stock based non cash compensation costs related to options issued under the equity incentive plan 
revenues 
revenue totaled million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  revenues included million of revenues related to citrus crop sales  which were up million from the prior year primarily due to the larger and longer lemon harvest season in comparison to the lemon harvest season  and million of revenues related to raisin sales  which were down million from the prior year primarily due to a smaller raisin crop in in comparison to the raisin crop 

back to top cost of sales 
cost of sales totaled million during the year ended december   compared with million during the year ended december  the higher cost of sales for the year ended december   related largely to the higher lemon harvesting related to the larger size of the lemon crop and the earlier timing of the lemon crop  which incurred substantially all costs in general and administrative expenses

back to top prior debt refinancings 
deferred loan costs  which are primarily legal fees  are amortized over the life of each loan agreement 
in june  we refinanced our term loan with ing capital llc ing with a new senior secured convertible term loan with a different lender

liquidity and capital resources a current financing arrangements as we have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date  we have been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource and other development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence 
historically  we have addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements  private equity placements and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants 
we have also worked with our secured lenders to structure our debt in a way which allows us to continue development of the water project and minimize the dilution of the ownership interests of common stockholders 
we refinanced our term debt in march see note to the consolidated financial statements subsequent events 
the major components of the refinancing included a million senior term loan secured by the underlying assets of the company that will accrue interest at per annum and require no principal or interest payments before maturity in march  and a million convertible bond that will accrue interest at per annum with no principal or interest payments required before maturity in march  and approximately million in new working capital provided as part of the convertible bond issuance 
we believe that by breaking our debt into two components  we now have the flexibility to incorporate project financing for the water project  as necessary  into our current debt structure 
while the new million senior term loan would be required to be taken out by any necessary project financing  the million convertible bond has been designed to allow project financing to be placed ahead of it in terms of priority 
the million of new working capital provides us with the resources to continue to move through our pre construction phase  including resolution of outstanding administrative ceqa litigation  facility engineering and design  and the finalization of water supply purchase agreements with all water project participants 

back to top the new financing replaced a term loan that was first entered into in june  consisting of a million five year zero coupon senior secured convertible term loan with peloton partners llp through an affiliate and another lender the term loan 
on april   we were advised that peloton had assigned its interest in the term loan to an affiliate of lampe conway company llc lampe conway  and lampe conway subsequently replaced peloton as administrative agent of the loan 
during the period the term loan was outstanding  it was expanded and modified and consisted of the following tranches as of december  tranche principal amount in thousands conversion price per share potential number of shares issuable tranche a tranche a a tranche a b non convertible tranche b tranche b tranche b a tranche b b non convertible tranche c tranche c tranche d non convertible both the new senior secured loan and the convertible bond contain representations  warranties and covenants that are typical for agreements of this type  including restrictions that would limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  pay dividends or make restricted payments  dispose of assets  make investments and merge or consolidate with another person 
however  while there are affirmative covenants  there are no financial maintenance covenants and no restrictions on our ability to issue additional common stock to fund future working capital needs 
the debt covenants associated with the new loans were negotiated by the parties with a view towards our operating and financial condition as it existed at the time the agreements were executed 
at december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants 
as a result of the modifications of the convertible debt arrangement in june and october  the change in conversion value between the original and modified instrument totaling approximately million was recorded as additional debt discount with a corresponding amount recorded as additional paid in capital 
such debt discount is accreted to the redemption value of the instrument over the remaining term of the loan as additional interest expense 
in connection with the modification transaction in october  we recorded a derivative liability related to the conversion option 
the fair value of the derivative liability was marked to market at the end of each reporting period with the associated change in fair value recorded as other income expense 
on july   we entered into an amendment to the facility eliminating the availability to the company of the unused million portion of the facility 
as a result  the conversion option related to the unused portion of the facility no longer exists and a derivative liability is no longer being recorded 
in connection with the october additional debt facility  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase shares of common stock 
the value of the warrant totaled approximately thousand and was recorded as additional debt discount with a corresponding amount recorded as additional paid in capital 

back to top in  we raised a total of million in working capital through three equity issuances 
on july   we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share for total proceeds of million 
on november   we raised million in a private placement of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
for every three shares of common stock issued  we issued common stock purchase warrant entitling the holder to purchase  commencing days from the date of the issuance and prior to december   one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on december   we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share for total proceeds of million 
as we continue to actively pursue our business strategy  additional financing may continue to be required 
see outlook  below 
the covenants in the term debt do not prohibit our use of additional equity financing and allow us to retain of the proceeds of any equity financing 
we do not expect the loan covenants to materially limit our ability to finance our water development activities 
at december   we had no outstanding credit facilities other than the convertible term loan 
cash used for operating activities 
cash used for operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the cash was primarily used to fund i general and administrative expenses related to our water development efforts  including the certification of the final environmental impact report  ii litigation costs  iii due diligence costs associated with exploring the feasibility of converting the natural gas pipelines  which we currently have an option to purchase  to water transportation facilities  and iv million in cash payments related to the extension of an option agreement with el paso natural gas see other development opportunities 
cash used for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities in the year ended december   was million  compared with million for the year ended december  the period included additional investments in well field and environmental work 
cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the results include million in proceeds received under our working capital facility 
the results include million in proceeds received under our working capital facility  million in proceeds from the issuance of shares under a shelf takedown offering  and million in proceeds from a private placement 
see current financing arrangements above 
b outlook short term outlook 
the million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in march provides us with sufficient funds to meet our expected working capital needs until mid should we require additional working capital to fund operations  we expect to continue our historical practice of structuring our financing arrangements to match the anticipated needs of our development activities 
see long term outlook 
no assurances can be given  however  as to the availability or terms of any few financing 

back to top long term outlook 
in the longer term  we will need to raise additional capital to finance working capital needs  capital expenditures and any payments due under our new term debt at maturity in march or our new convertible bond at maturity in march see current financing arrangements above 
our future working capital needs will depend upon the specific measures we pursue in the entitlement and development of our water resources and other developments 
future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the progress of the water project 
we will evaluate the amount of cash needed  and the manner in which such cash will be raised  on an ongoing basis 
we may meet any future cash requirements through a variety of means  including equity or debt placements  or through the sale or other disposition of assets 
equity placements would be undertaken only to the extent necessary  so as to minimize the dilutive effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders 
limitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us 
sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities 
although we currently expect our sources of capital to be sufficient to meet our near term liquidity needs  there can be no assurance that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied 
if the company cannot raise needed funds  it might be forced to make substantial reductions in its operating expenses  which could adversely affect its ability to implement its current business plan and ultimately its viability as a company 
c critical accounting policies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements based on all relevant information available at the time and giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
management has concluded that the following critical accounting policies described below affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
intangible and other long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
goodwill 
as a result of a merger in may between two companies  which eventually became known as cadiz inc  goodwill in the amount of  was recorded 
approximately  of this amount was amortized until the adoption of accounting standards codification  intangibles goodwill and other asc on january  
back to top valuation of goodwill and long lived assets 
the company assesses long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the impairment is measured by using the projected discounted cash flow method 
the company reevaluates the carrying value of its water program annually 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of december  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable  using the market method  as well as the discounted cash flow method 
the company uses a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any for the company 
the step calculation  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of the company to its net carrying value book values  including goodwill  on the measurement date 
if the fair value of the company is less than its carrying value  step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 
the step calculation of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the estimated fair value above the fair value of the company identified assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of its assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
to date  the company has not generated significant revenue from its water development programs  and it has a history of net operating losses 
as such  the company has generated significant deferred tax assets  including large net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income taxes for which it has recorded a full valuation allowance 
management is currently working on water storage  water supply  agriculture and solar energy development projects  including the water project  that are designed to generate future taxable income  although there can be no guarantee that this will occur 
if taxable income is generated in future years  some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed  and an increase in net income would consequently be reported 
stock based compensation 
the company applies the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted to employees and consultants 
for employees  the fair value is then charged to expense on the straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for consultants  the fair value is remeasured at each reporting period and recorded as a liability until the award is settled 

back to top asc also requires the company to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation as opposed to only recognizing forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur 
the remaining vesting periods are relatively short  and the potential impact of forfeitures is not material
