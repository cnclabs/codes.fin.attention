management overview during  we continued to execute on our business plan of growing revenue and ebitda of the reis services business at an accelerating rate over our growth was the result of contributions from three products reis se  the company s core offering  and to a lesser but still meaningful extent  from our data redistribution relationships and our small business offering  reisreports 
for reis se  we continue to maintain an overall trailing twelve month renewal rate of approximately  while 
table of contents achieving record levels of new business and total contract signings during we increased the number of reis se subscribers to  including selling to new banks that were not previously customers 
our data redistribution initiative continues to provide additional opportunities to sell reis s proprietary content through the platforms of financial information vendors with whom we have existing relationships  and we are looking to expand these relationships further in we continue to refine our reisreports product  including recruiting senior management with significant experience in relevant aspects of web marketing  and we expect further acceleration in the growth of this product in to sustain our robust growth  our team is focused on providing must have  quality data and analytics 
the cornerstones of our business model include the consistent introduction of new content in the form of new geographic markets and property types  and the roll out of powerful analytic modules that help our customers make superior business and investment decisions 
by making investments in our databases and web sites during  we are positioned to launch new content  functionality and analytics that we can deliver across our multiple distribution platforms  further distancing reis s product offerings from those of our competitors 
reis continues to demonstrate high levels of revenue visibility  strong ebitda margins and significant cash generation ability  attributes that we believe will result in meaningful value creation for our shareholders 
our multi year business plan recognizes that our core assets include our databases  our premier brand  a subscriber base comprised of the world s leading institutional investors  our superior technology  and the human capital within the reis organization 
we have made prudent capital investments in our business and expect to continue to do so in as we look to continue to grow revenue and ebitda in and beyond 
our cash balance  which was reduced substantially in due to the  aggregate litigation settlement payments and  final debt repayments  was approximately  at december  we expect that balance to grow during as we retain the cash generated by our high margin  recurring revenue information business 
the following information provides additional insight into our performance 
critical business metrics of the reis services business management considers certain metrics in evaluating the performance of the reis services business 
these metrics are revenue  ebitda which is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitda margin 
following is a presentation of these historical metrics for the reis services business see below for a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for both the reis services segment and on a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented here 
amounts in thousands  excluding percentages for the three months ended december  percentage increase increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the three months ended december  september  increase percentage increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin for the years ended december  percentage increase increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin 
table of contents amounts in thousands  excluding percentages for the years ended december  percentage increase increase revenue ebitda ebitda margin reis services s revenue increased by approximately  or  from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of and  or  for the year ended december  over the comparable annual period 
the revenue increase over the corresponding prior quarterly period is the th consecutive quarterly increase in revenue over the prior year s quarter 
in addition  revenue increased by approximately  or  from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of these revenue increases reflect incremental new business as the fourth quarter and year produced the highest level of new contract signings in the company s history reflected in the growth in the number of reis se subscribers from at december  to subscribers at december   revenue growth from our data redistribution initiatives  revenue growth from reisreports  custom project revenue in in excess of amounts as more fully described below and the cumulative impact of the increased volume of contract signings in and throughout the company s overall renewal rate for the trailing twelve months ended december  was  as compared to for the corresponding period in for institutional subscribers  the renewal rates were and at december  and  respectively 
the revenue growth for the fourth quarter and annual periods reflected incremental revenue from one specific custom project of  and  respectively 
excluding this custom project from our reported revenue would result  on a pro forma basis  in revenue growth of in the fourth quarter of and for the annual period in contrast with our reported amounts of growth of and  respectively 
we do not expect to have custom work of this magnitude in the first quarter of  and therefore  we expect that revenue and ebitda will decrease from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of however  on a pro forma basis  excluding the custom revenue referred to above  we expect revenue and ebitda to grow in those consecutive periods 
we do not expect an interruption in revenue and ebitda growth in the first quarter of over the first quarter of the increase in annual revenue was approximately  or  from the year ended december  the annual revenue increases reflected positive improvements in overall renewal rates as the trailing twelve month renewal rate improved to at december  as compared to for the trailing twelve months ended december  for institutional subscribers  the renewal rates improved to at december  from at december   additional new business  sales from reisreports  and the cumulative impact of the strength of contract signings in and throughout reis s revenue model is based primarily on annual subscriptions that are paid in accordance with contractual billing terms 
reis recognizes revenue from its contracts on a ratable basis  for example  one twelfth of the value of a one year contract is recognized monthly 
therefore  increases in the dollar value of new contracts are spread evenly over the life of a contract  thereby moderating an immediate impact on revenue 
historically  the largest percentage of our contracts are executed in the fourth quarter of each year 
our contract pricing model is based on actual and projected report consumption  we believe it is generally not as susceptible to economic downturns and personnel reductions at our subscribers as a model based upon individual user licenses 
we typically impose contractual restrictions limiting our immediate exposure during existing contract terms to revenue reductions due to mergers and consolidations 
however  we have been  and we may in the future be impacted by consolidation among our subscribers and potential subscribers  or in the event that subscribers enter bankruptcy or otherwise go out of business 
two additional metrics management utilizes in understanding the business and future performance are deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract 
analyzing these amounts can provide additional insight into reis services s financial performance 
deferred revenue  which is a gaap basis accounting concept and is reported by the company on the consolidated balance sheet  represents revenue from annual or longer term contracts for which we have billed and or received payments from our subscribers related to services we will be providing over the remaining contract period 
it does not include future revenue under non cancellable contracts for which we do not yet have the contractual right to bill  this aggregate number we refer to as aggregate revenue under contract 
deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining life of a contract 
the following table reconciles deferred revenue to aggregate revenue under contract at december  and  respectively 

table of contents december  deferred revenue gaap basis amounts under non cancellable contracts for which the company does not yet have the contractual right to bill at the period end a aggregate revenue under contract a amounts are billable subsequent to december of each year and represent i non cancellable contracts for subscribers with multi year subscriptions where the future years are not yet billable  or ii subscribers with non cancellable annual subscriptions with interim billing terms 
included in aggregate revenue under contract at december  was approximately  related to amounts under contract for the forward twelve month period through december  the remainder reflects amounts under contract beyond december  the forward twelve month aggregate revenue under contract amount is approximately of revenue on a trailing twelve month basis at december  for comparison purposes  at december  and  the forward twelve month aggregate revenue under contract of  and  respectively  and as a percentage of that year s revenue was approximately and  respectively 
both deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract are influenced by the timing and dollar value of contracts signed and billed  the quantity and timing of contracts that are multi year  and the impact of recording revenue ratably over the life of a multi year contract  which moderates the effect of price increases after the first year 
coupled with record new business and contract signings in  the company signed more multi year contracts in both number of contracts and gross dollar value in than in any previous annual period 
these factors resulted in the increase in both deferred revenue and aggregate revenue under contract in ebitda for the three months ended december  was  an increase of  or  over the fourth quarter amount and increased  or  in the year ended december  over the comparable annual period 
on a consecutive quarter basis  ebitda increased  or in the fourth quarter over the third quarter these ebitda increases were driven by the revenue growth as described above  offset by increasing employment related costs in over  the net effect of which improved our ebitda margins over the prior year periods to and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
ebitda in the fourth quarter and annual periods was similarly impacted from the aforementioned incremental custom work 
excluding only that incremental custom revenue from our reported ebitda  would result  on a pro forma basis  in ebitda growth of in the fourth quarter of and for the annual period in contrast with our reported amounts of growth of and  respectively 
ebitda of reis services for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  over the corresponding period 
this increase was directly influenced by the increase in revenue for the year ended december  over  as described above  while maintaining ebitda margins for the reis services segment at approximately 
reconciliations of income from continuing operations to ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation 
although ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  senior management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda to measure operational and management performance 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are appropriate metrics that may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported gaap basis financial information to assist investors in evaluating and understanding the performance of the reis services segment  the primary business of the company and the company s continuing consolidated results  from year to year or period to period  as applicable 
further  these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization expenses  as well as other non operating items  such as interest income  interest expense and income taxes and  in the case of adjusted ebitda  isolates non cash charges for stock based compensation 
management also believes that disclosing ebitda and adjusted ebitda will provide better comparability to other companies in the information services sector 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are presented both for the reis services business and on a consolidated basis 
we believe that these metrics  for reis services  provide the reader with valuable information for evaluating the financial performance of the core reis services business  excluding public company costs  and to make assessments about the intrinsic value of that stand alone business to a potential acquirer 
management primarily monitors and measures its performance  and is compensated  based on the results of the 
table of contents reis services business 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda  on a consolidated basis  allow the reader to make assessments about the current trading value of the company s common stock  including expenses related to operating as a public company 
however  investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income loss  income from continuing operations  operating income  or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not calculated in accordance with gaap  they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

table of contents the income tax benefit from continuing operations during the year ended december  of  reflects an aggregate deferred federal  state and local income tax benefit as a result of the partial release of the company s valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reversed the valuation allowance recorded against a portion of its nol carryforwards 
the decision to reverse this amount of the valuation allowance was made after management determined  based on an assessment of continuing operations  profitability and forecasts of future taxable income  that these deferred tax assets would be realized 
the income tax benefit from continuing operations during the year ended december  of  reflects the resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit as a result of the expiration of the applicable state s statute of limitations 
the loss from discontinued operations of  reflects a charge of  recorded at december  in connection with the construction defect litigation at our gold peak development project as more fully described in item legal proceedings  offset by a gain on the sale of the east lyme project in a bulk transaction in april of  and net other income of  primarily from the release of unused warranty accruals on home sales at the east lyme project 
the income from discontinued operations of  primarily reflects the sale of the claverack project in a bulk transaction in february for a gain of  the sale of one home and two lots at east lyme in and the reversal of certain employment related contractual obligations for amounts less than prior period accruals  offset by operating expenses and related general and administrative expenses 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the net deferred tax asset was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  of which  and  is reflected as a net current asset and  and  is reflected as a net non current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the respective dates 
the significant portion of the deferred tax items primarily relates to nol carryforwards  federal amt credit carryforwards  stock based compensation  and liability reserves  all as they relate to deferred tax assets  and the deferred tax liability resulting from the intangible assets recorded at the time of the merger 
the company has aggregate federal  state and local nol carryforwards aggregating approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
these nols include nols generated subsequent to the merger  losses from private reis prior to the merger  losses obtained from the company s merger with vlp and the company s operating losses prior to the merger 
at december   approximately  of these federal nols are subject to an annual limitation  whereas the remaining balance of approximately  is not subject to such a limitation 
there is an annual limitation on the use of nols after an ownership change  pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
as a result of the merger  the company experienced such an ownership change which resulted in a new annual limitation of  however  because of the accumulation of annual limitations  it is expected that the use of nols will not be limited by expiration 
a substantial nol was realized during the year ended december  as a result of the gold peak litigation settlement discussed in note a further requirement of the tax rules is that after a corporation experiences an ownership change  it must satisfy the continuity of business enterprise  or cobe  requirement which generally requires that a corporation continue its historic business or use a significant portion of its historic business assets in its business for the two year period beginning on the date of the ownership change to be able to utilize nols generated prior to such ownership change 
the company believes that the cobe requirement was met through the required two year period subsequent to the ownership change  and utilized an aggregate of approximately  of these pre merger nols in its federal tax return filings for and  with appropriate disclosure 
in february  the internal revenue service irs completed an audit of the company s federal income tax return 
the tax year included the end of the two year period subsequent to the merger 
the irs issued a no change letter related to the company s tax return  thereby accepting the company s position that the two year cobe requirement was met 
consequently  as of december   the company had restored approximately  of nols  the tax benefit of which was approximately  with an equal amount of valuation allowance 
there was no impact to the december  consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statements of income as a result of this event 
the company does not have any near term expirations of nols  the next nol expiration is in for approximately  of federal nols 
included in federal and state nols at december  is approximately  attributable to excess tax deductions from the issuance of common shares as non cash compensation 
the tax benefits attributable to those nols will be credited directly to additional paid in capital when utilized to offset taxes payable 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  management has determined that a valuation allowance of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  was necessary 
the allowance at december  and relates primarily to nol carryforwards  amt credits and  in  liability reserves 
the decrease in 
table of contents the allowance in is primarily attributable to the  increase in deferred tax assets expected to be realized in the years subsequent to december   offset in part by the litigation settlement payments made in  net of recoveries  which resulted in an increase to the nol 
the decrease in the allowance in is primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowance against deferred assets expected to be utilized in the three years subsequent to december   as discussed above  of  a reduction in the effective tax rate utilized by the company approximately  and utilizing the tax loss on the sale of the company s east lyme project for which an allowance was provided for  related to the net liability in  offset by the allowance provided for the net litigation liability at december  as part of its assessment to reduce a portion of the valuation allowance and reflect deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december   management considered many factors  including the completion of sales in of assets in its residential development activities segment  the trend of pre tax income from both continuing operations and income before taxes  on a consolidated basis without consideration of discontinued operations reporting  and the predictability of future pre tax income for the next three years 
the company re assessed these factors at december   including the predictability of future pre tax income for the next five years 
based upon these factors  and consideration of uncertainties that could affect the ultimate usability of the deferred tax assets  management has concluded to record an aggregate deferred tax asset of  and  at december  and  respectively 
in order to be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future  the company considered its historic trend in revenue and ebitda growth rates  the expected level of future amortization and depreciation expense and the expectation that there should be minimal financial impact from the discontinued operations 
if revenue and ebitda growth is not achieved to the extent expected  or at all  if ebitda margins materially decline  or if material losses occur as a result of our discontinued operations  the ability to fully utilize these assets in future years could be affected 
there is no expectation of future taxable income being derived from a source other than ordinary and recurring operations of the company s business to be able to utilize deferred tax assets 
management was unable to conclude that all of its deferred tax assets would be realized  and therefore has maintained a valuation allowance of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company will continue to evaluate the amount of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets during and subsequent years based on such factors as historic profitability levels and forecasts of future taxable income 
the company s reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  including estimated interest  was  and  at december  and  respectively 
interest related to these tax provisions was included in general and administrative expenses 
in  the benefit of  related to the resolution of related unrecognized tax benefits 
the company recorded an additional provision  including interest  of  in as a result of a determination that the company would be liable for additional taxes in new york city for any years that are open and under audit by new york state 
no additional expense was recorded in debt bank loan in connection with the merger agreement  private reis entered into a credit agreement  dated october   with the bank of montreal  chicago branch  as administrative agent  and bmo capital markets  as lead arranger  which provided for a term loan of up to an aggregate of  and revolving loans up to an aggregate of  loan proceeds were used to finance  of the cash portion of the merger consideration

selected significant accounting policies management has identified the following accounting policies which it believes are significant in understanding the company s activities  financial position and operating results 
principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
investments in entities where the company does not have a controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these investments were initially recorded at cost and were subsequently adjusted for the company s proportionate share of the investment s income loss and additional contributions or distributions 
all intercompany accounts and transactions among the company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
discontinued operations the company determined  as a result of the april sale of property in east lyme  connecticut  that the residential development activities segment  including certain general and administrative costs that supported that segment s operations  should be presented as a discontinued operation 
as a result of this determination and the fact that the historic operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  the operating results of the residential development activities segment and related general and administrative costs are aggregated for separate presentation apart from continuing operating results of the company in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
intangible assets  amortization and impairment web site development costs the company expenses all internet web site costs incurred during the preliminary project stage 
thereafter  all direct external and internal development and implementation costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over their remaining estimated useful lives  not exceeding three years 
the value ascribed to the web site intangible asset acquired at the time of the merger was amortized on a straight line basis over three years  and during  this ascribed value was fully amortized 
amortization of all capitalized web site development costs is charged to product development expense 
database costs the company capitalizes costs for the development of its database in connection with the identification and addition of new real estate properties and sale transactions which provide a future economic benefit 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over a three or five year period 
costs of updating and maintaining information on existing properties in the database are expensed as incurred 
the value ascribed to the database intangible asset acquired at the time of the merger was amortized on a straight line basis over three or five years 
the ascribed value having a three and five year amortizable life was fully amortized in and  respectively 
amortization of all capitalized database costs is charged to cost of sales 
customer relationships the value ascribed to customer relationships acquired at the time of the merger is amortized over years on an accelerated basis and is charged to sales and marketing expense 
lease value the value ascribed to the below market terms of the office lease existing at the time of the merger is amortized over the remaining term of the acquired office lease which was approximately nine years 
amortization is charged to general and administrative expenses 

table of contents goodwill and intangible asset impairment goodwill and a major portion of the other intangible assets were recorded at the time of the merger 
as a result of the tax treatment of the merger  goodwill and the acquired intangible assets are not deductible for income tax purposes 
goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually  or after a triggering event has occurred  requiring such a calculation 
a qualitative assessment can be utilized to determine if a more detailed two step calculation is required 
if the qualitative assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill  then no further evaluation would be necessary 
if  after performing the qualitative assessment  the company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill  then the first step of the two step test would be necessary 
the first step is a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned with the reporting unit s carrying value 
the fair values used in this evaluation would be estimates based upon market projections for the reporting unit 
these market projections would utilize a number of estimates and assumptions  such as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples  market comparisons  and quoted market prices 
if the fair value of the reporting unit were to exceed its carrying value  goodwill would not be deemed to be impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  a second step would be required to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
the company early adopted the qualitative assessment guidance for goodwill in  which did not impact the consolidated financial statements  other than disclosure  and utilized the qualitative assessment for its evaluation 
there was no goodwill impairment identified in  or intangible assets  with determinable useful lives  are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
in addition  the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset would be considered impaired 
an impairment charge would be determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
there was no intangible asset impairment identified in  or revenue recognition and related items the company s subscription revenue is derived principally from subscriptions to its web based services for its reis se product and is recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period  which is typically one year but can be as long as months 
revenues from ad hoc and custom reports or projects are recognized as completed and delivered to the customers  provided that no significant company obligations remain 
revenues from reisreports are recognized monthly as billed for monthly subscribers  or recognized as revenue ratably over the related contractual period for subscriptions in excess of one month 
deferred revenue represents the portion of a subscription billed or collected in advance under the terms of the respective contract  which will be recognized in future periods 
if a customer does not meet the payment obligations of a contract  any related accounts receivable and deferred revenue are written off at that time and the net amount  after considering any recovery of accounts receivable  is charged to cost of sales 
cost of sales of subscription revenue principally consists of salaries and related expenses for the company s researchers who collect and analyze the commercial real estate data that is the basis for the company s information services 
additionally  cost of sales includes the amortization of the database technology intangible asset 
revenue from sales of real estate in and  including single family homes and sales of lots individually or in bulk  were recognized at closing subject to receipt of down payments and other requirements in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines 
interest revenue is recorded on an accrual basis 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances with respect to deferred income tax assets are recorded when deemed appropriate and adjusted based upon periodic evaluations 

table of contents the company evaluates its tax positions in accordance with applicable current accounting literature 
recognition of uncertain tax positions step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained or there is a satisfactory resolution of the tax position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure has been to changes in interest rates 
this risk may be managed by limiting the company s financing exposures  to the extent possible  by purchasing interest rate caps when deemed appropriate 
at december  and  the company s only exposure to interest rates was variable rate based debt 
this exposure has historically been minimized through the use of interest rate caps 
the interest rate cap on the bank loan expired at june  and the company has not purchased any additional interest rate caps subsequent to that expiration 
the following table presents the effect of a increase in the applicable base rates of outstanding variable rate debt at december   no debt was outstanding at december  amounts in thousands balance at december  libor at december  additional interest incurred variable rate debt bank loan  a a reflects additional interest which could be incurred annually on the then outstanding loan balance amount as a result of a increase in libor 
it does not take into consideration future periodic repayments 
although the interest rate cap expired at june   our interest rate exposure on the bank loan was limited and diminished significantly as a result of increased scheduled principal repayments during through its final repayment in june management obtained replacement financing in october  but no amounts have been drawn under the revolver during reis holds cash and cash equivalents at various regional and national banking institutions 
management monitors the institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
management s emphasis is primarily on safety of principal 
management  in its discretion  has diversified reis s cash and cash equivalents among banking institutions to potentially minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
cash balances held at banking institutions with which we do business may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while management monitors the cash balances in these bank accounts  such cash balances could be impacted if the underlying banks fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets
