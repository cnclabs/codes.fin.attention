item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the results of our operations are included in two separately reportable segments  system one and in center 
other business activities relate primarily to the manufacturing of dialyzers for sale to asahi  certain business development activities  including our early work on establishing centers of excellence which are dialysis clinics focused on the provision of home therapies  including home hemodialysis  and certain corporate expenses  specifically research and development and general and administrative expenses  which are excluded from the segment operating performance measures 
in the system one segment we derive our revenues from the sale and rental of the system one and pureflow sl equipment and the sale of disposable products in the home and critical care markets 
the home market is devoted to the treatment of esrd patients within a homelike setting  while the critical care market is devoted to the treatment of hospital based patients with acute kidney failure or fluid overload 
in the in center segment  we derive our revenues from the sale of blood tubing sets and needles for hemodialysis primarily for the treatment of esrd patients at dialysis centers and needles for apheresis  which is referred to as the in center market 
financial performance during  we grew our revenues from million during to million during  with growth occurring in each market home  critical care and in center 
home revenues continue to drive the growth increasing million  or  during compared to  driven by an increase in the number of patients prescribed to use and centers offering the system one 
we have continued to increase both the average number of patients at existing centers and centers offering the system one  primarily through existing relationships with service providers  including davita and fresenius 
critical care market revenues increased million  or  during compared to  primarily due to increased sales of disposables from our growing installed base of system one equipment 
in  we expect to see continued growth in our system one revenues  primarily driven by the annuity nature of our business  as well as the life sustaining  non elective nature of dialysis therapy 
our two largest customers in the home market  davita and fresenius  will be important to that growth 
if the purchasing patterns of either of these customers adversely change  our business will be adversely affected  at least in the near term 
in center revenues increased million  or  during compared to driven by increased sales of needle products due to increased end user demand 
we expect future demand will continue to be susceptible to fluctuation as a result of increased competition and variations in inventory management policies with both our distributors and end users 
we continue to see improvements in our financial performance below the revenue line 
we have not yet achieved profitable operating margins  but we continue to improve gross profit as a percentage of revenues from during to during to during the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was mainly attributable to higher relative sales of higher margin products  lower product costs and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar  partially offset by costs incurred by manufacturing transition costs related to the startup of the new dialyzer manufacturing plant in germany and costs related to the earthquakes in the second quarter of affecting our manufacturing facility in northern italy 
while we expect to continue to improve gross profit as a percentage of revenues as a result of various initiatives  including the expansion and rationalization of our manufacturing network  these improvements will 
table of contents continue to be offset in the short term by associated costs and will be impacted favorably and unfavorably by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar 
we are encouraged by the improvements to our operating margins and are continuing to work toward our long term goal of achieving profitable operating margins 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to improve our operating margins or achieve positive operating margins 
improvements to our operating margins depend principally upon continued improvements in gross margins  growing revenues  and the leverage of our operating infrastructure including after taking into account the effects of any investment in selling and marketing or research and development activities or investment in new business development  including with respect to centers of excellence 
additionally  our operating margins will be negatively impacted beginning in due to the medical device excise tax which will be assessed on nearly all of our products sold in the us statement of comprehensive loss components revenues in the system one segment we derive our revenues from the sale and rental of equipment and the sale of disposable products in the home and critical care markets 
in the home market  customers purchase or rent the system one equipment  including cycler and pureflow sl  and then purchase the related disposable products based on a specific patient prescription 
in the critical care market  we sell or rent the system one and related disposables to hospital customers 
in the in center segment  we derive our revenues from the sale of needles and blood tubing sets 
nearly all of our sales in the in center segment are through supply and distribution contracts with distributors 
in the home market the majority of our revenue is derived from recurring sales of disposable products 
for customers that purchase the system one  we recognize revenue from the equipment sale ratably over the expected service obligation period 
for customers that rent the system one  we recognize revenue on a monthly basis 
we recognize revenues related to the disposable products upon delivery 
over time  as more home patients are treated with the system one and more systems are placed in patient homes  we expect to derive a growing recurring revenue stream from the sale of related disposables 
our contracts with dialysis centers in the home market for esrd home dialysis patients generally include terms providing for the sale of disposable products to accommodate up to the number of prescribed treatments per month per patient and the purchase or monthly rental of system one cyclers and  in most instances  our pureflow sl hardware 
these contracts typically have a term of one to seven years  and may be renewed on a month to month basis thereafter  subject to a day termination notice 
under these contracts  if home hemodialysis is prescribed  supplies are shipped directly to patient homes and paid for by the treating dialysis center 
we also include vacation delivery terms  providing for the shipment of products to a designated vacation destination for a specified number of vacation days 
we derive a small amount of revenues from the sale of supplementary products and services such as ancillaries  reserve inventory and special deliveries 
in the critical care market we recognize revenues from direct product sales at the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
our contracts with hospitals generally include terms providing for the sale of our system one hardware and disposables  although we also provide a hardware rental option 
these contracts typically have a term of one year 
we derive a small amount of revenues from the sale of one and two year service contracts following the expiration of our standard one year warranty period for system one hardware 
to further support service in the critical care market  we have a bio medical training program  whereby we train bio medical engineers on how to service and repair certain aspects of the system one in the critical care setting 
bio medical training is typically provided under a two year contract following the expiration of our standard one year warranty period for system one hardware 
as more system one equipment is placed within hospitals  we expect to continue to derive a growing recurring revenue stream from the sale of disposable 
table of contents cartridges and fluids as well as  to a much lesser degree  from the sale of service and bio medical training contracts 
in the in center segment nearly all sales to end users are structured through supply and distribution contracts with several significant distributors  however  in many instances we have direct contractual relationships with our end user customers 
these contracts typically contain minimum volume commitments with negotiated pricing triggers at different volume tiers 
in addition to contractually determined volume discounts  we offer certain customers rebates based on sales to specific end users and discounts for early payment 
our revenues are presented net of these rebates and discounts 
as of december   we had million and million reserved against trade accounts receivable for future rebates and discounts for customers in our in center and system one segments  respectively 
we recorded million  million  and million during  and  respectively  as a reduction of in center segment revenues and million  million and million during  and  respectively  as a reduction of system one segment revenues in connection with rebates and discounts 
the majority of our revenues have been generated from sales to customers in the us we sell our system one and certain of our other products internationally  primarily through distributors 
for sales to our international distributors that occurred prior to january   we recognize revenues from the equipment sale ratably over the expected term of our remaining service obligation  which is five years 
for sales occurring on or after january   we recognize revenues from equipment sales at the time of shipment or  if applicable  delivery in accordance with contract terms 
disposable product revenues has continually been recognized upon delivery 
we also manufacture and sell dialyzers to asahi and recognize revenues at time of shipment in accordance with contract terms 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of direct product costs  material and labor required to manufacture our products  service of system one equipment that we sell or rent to customers and manufacturing overhead 
it also includes the cost of inspecting  servicing and repairing system one equipment prior to sale or during the warranty period and stock based compensation for certain personnel 
the cost of our products depends on several factors  including the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  the cost at which we can obtain labor and products from third party suppliers  product reliability and related servicing costs and the design of our products 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for sales and marketing personnel  travel  promotional and marketing materials and other expenses associated with providing clinical training to our customers 
included in selling and marketing are the costs of clinical educators  usually nurses  we employ to teach our customers about our products and prepare our customers to instruct their patients and their partners in the operation of our products and customer service and technical support personnel 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for research and development personnel  supplies  materials and expenses associated with product design and development  clinical studies  regulatory submissions  reporting and compliance and expenses incurred for outside consultants or firms who furnish services related to these activities 
distribution 
distribution expenses include the freight costs of delivering our products to our customers or our customers patients  depending on the market and the specific agreements with our customers  salary  benefits and stock based compensation for distribution personnel and the cost of any equipment lost or damaged in the distribution process 
we use common carriers and freight companies to deliver our products and do not 
table of contents operate our own delivery service 
also included in this category are the expenses of shipping products under warranty from customers back to our service center for repair and the related expense of shipping a replacement product to our customers or their patients 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  benefits and stock based compensation for our executive management  legal and finance and accounting staff  fees of outside legal counsel  fees for our annual audit and tax services  and general expenses to operate the business  including insurance and other corporate related expenses 
also included in general and administrative expenses beginning in will be tax expenses incurred related to the medical device excise tax 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues our revenues for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  system one segment home critical care total system one segment in center segment other total in the home market  revenues increased million  or  during compared to  driven by the increase in the number of patients prescribed to use and centers offering the system one 
during  we increased both the number of patients at existing centers and centers offering the system one  primarily through our existing relationships with service providers  including davita and fresenius 
critical care market revenues increased million  or  during compared to  primarily due to increased sales of disposables from our growing number of system one equipment placed within hospitals  partially offset by lower sales of our system one equipment 
sales of our system one equipment in the critical care market are subject to fluctuation due to timing of sales and the overall capital spending environment 
we expect future demand for our products and revenue growth in both the home and critical care markets to be strong as we further penetrate these markets  expand internationally  and leverage the annuity nature of our business 
however  this revenue growth will be slightly offset on an ongoing basis by lower deferred revenue recognized on previously sold system one equipment in the us home market as a result of equipment reaching the end of its relative revenue amortization period 
further  the us dialysis market is highly consolidated with davita and fresenius providing treatment to approximately two thirds of us dialysis patients 
our customers in the us home market have a range of treatment options available  including traditional in center dialysis and peritoneal dialysis 
convincing our customers  in particular davita and fresenius  to make investments in their training infrastructure to expand their offering of home hemodialysis using our system one will be important to our continued revenue growth in the future 
if the purchasing patterns of either davita or fresenius adversely change  our business would be negatively affected  at least in the near term 
additionally  our system one revenue will continue to be susceptible to fluctuations in international equipment sales and changes in inventory levels at our international distributors 
in center segment revenues increased million  or  during compared to the increase in revenues was driven by higher sales of needles due to increased end user demand 
while revenues continue to be susceptible to fluctuations in inventory levels at our distributors  end user demand of both our blood tubing sets 
table of contents and our needle products continues to grow at a rate equal to or greater than the growth in the esrd population 
however  we expect future revenues will continue to be susceptible to fluctuation as a result of increased competition and variations in inventory management policies with both our distributors and end users 
in center revenues will also be negatively impacted  at least in the near term  if we are unable to negotiate an extension of davita s needle purchase agreement with us which is scheduled to terminate in april other revenues relate to dialyzers sold to asahi pursuant to our dialyzer production agreement 
gross profit our gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  system one segment in center segment subtotal other n a gross profit gross profit increased million  or  and increased as an overall percentage of revenue during compared to driven in large part by the system one segment 
gross profit for the system one segment increased million  or  during compared to in addition to the impact of increased revenues  the improvement in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the system one segment was attributable to several factors  including lower product costs driven by certain cost savings initiatives  improvement in product design and reliability and continued leveraging of our manufacturing infrastructure  favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations versus the us dollar and increased relative sales of higher margin products 
gross profit for the in center segment increased million  or 
in addition to the impact of increased revenues  the improvement of gross profits and gross profit as a percentage of revenues in the in center segment was attributable to favorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations versus the us dollar  favorable pricing for certain products and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by costs related to the earthquakes in the second quarter of affecting our manufacturing facility in northern italy 
the other category relates to the manufacturing of dialyzers for sale to asahi and includes related start up production costs for the new manufacturing plant in germany 
we expect that this relationship should provide us with long term cost efficiencies through increased dialyzer production volumes 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenues will continue to improve in the long term for three general reasons  all of which we expect will reduce costs in the future 
first  we expect to introduce additional process improvements and product design changes that have inherently lower costs than the costs associated with our current products 
second  we anticipate that increased volume  expansion and improved leverage of our manufacturing operations and rationalization of our supply chain will lead to lower costs and better purchasing terms and prices 
finally  we expect to continue to improve product reliability  which would reduce unit service costs 
however  there is no certainty that our expectations or the projected timing associated with our expectations will be achieved with respect to these cost reduction plans 
further  these improvements in gross profit as a percentage of revenues may be offset in the short term for five general reasons  all of which could negatively impact gross profit 
first  we manufacture a large majority of our products internationally and purchase products from foreign companies in other than us dollars and  therefore  our product costs are subject 
table of contents to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
any unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar would negatively impact our gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
second  we expect that we will continue to incur higher transportation costs driven by increased prices from carriers and changes in fuel prices 
third  we may see an increase in service costs as the existing system one equipment ages and increases in the cost of certain raw materials 
we may not be able to pass these costs along to our customers through higher prices for our products 
fourth  we expect future demand for our products to continue to grow  however  higher relative sales of lower margin products  including the sale of dialyzers to asahi  and certain pricing strategies would have a negative impact on gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
finally  rationalization and consolidation of our manufacturing operations  in an effort to drive long term gross margin improvement  will require us to incur additional costs in the short term 
selling and marketing our selling and marketing expenses and selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  system one segment in center segment other  n a n a total selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  during compared to the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily the result of increased personnel and personnel related costs and increased spending due to expanded marketing programs within both segments 
selling and marketing expenses for the system one segment decreased as a percentage of revenues during compared to due to our initiative to continue to leverage our infrastructure 
selling and marketing expenses for the in center segment remained consistent as a percentage of revenues during compared to due to our efforts to continue to broaden our marketing programs while still leveraging our existing infrastructure 
selling and marketing expenses for our other category relates primarily to personnel and personnel related costs related to business development activities  including our centers of excellence initiative 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we increase public awareness of the system one in the home market  broaden our marketing and business development initiatives  and support growth in international markets 
research and development our research and development expenses and research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  research and development research and development expenses increased million  or  during compared to but remained consistent as a percentage of revenues 
the increase was primarily due to increased personnel and personnel related costs and increased project related spending 
for the near term  we expect research and development expenses will increase as we seek to further develop and enhance our system one  invest in our peritoneal dialysis product development program and expand our product portfolio 

table of contents distribution our distribution expenses and distribution expenses as a percentage of revenues for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  system one segment in center segment total distribution distribution expenses increased million  or  during compared to due to increased business volumes but remained consistent as a percentage of revenues 
distribution expenses for the system one segment remained consistent as a percentage of revenues 
distribution network efficiencies were offset by higher carrier rates 
distribution expenses for the in center segment decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues primarily due to decreased costs associated with shipping certain of our products from our international manufacturing locations to our customers 
we expect that distribution expenses over the long term will increase at a lower rate than revenues due to expected efficiencies gained from increased business volume and improved reliability of system one equipment 
however  these favorable impacts may be offset by overall increases in fuel costs and enhanced distribution services 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million  or  during compared to but remained constant as a percentage of revenues 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased professional services  personnel and personnel related costs and other related infrastructure costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase beginning in due to the medical device excise tax which will be assessed on nearly all of our products sold in the us however  over time we expect general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues as we continue to leverage our existing infrastructure 
other expense interest expense decreased million during compared to in may  we repaid our term loan with asahi through the issuance of shares of our common stock 
interest expense ceased upon repayment  however  the repayment resulted in the early recognition of approximately million of unamortized debt discount during the second quarter of the change in other expense income  net during both periods is derived primarily by foreign currency gains and losses 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million in and million in relates to the profitable operations of certain foreign entities and changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions

the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was attributable to several factors  including lower product manufacturing and service costs driven by continued leveraging of our manufacturing infrastructure  certain cost saving initiatives and improvements in product design and reliability  and lower depreciation expense on our field equipment assets resulting from the change in the useful life of certain of these assets from five to seven years 

table of contents gross profit for the in center segment increased in absolute dollars but decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues during compared to the change in gross profit was driven by increased revenues offset by costs incurred relating to the transition of certain blood tubing sets from a contract manufacturer to our own manufacturing facility  increased freight costs and increased resin costs as a result of higher oil prices

the change in other expense income  net during both periods is derived primarily by foreign currency gains and losses 
provision for foreign income taxes the provision for income taxes of million in and million in relates primarily to the profitable operations of certain of our foreign entities 
liquidity and capital resources we have operated at a loss since our inception in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and we had cash and cash equivalents of million  with nearly all of that cash located in the us  and working capital of million 
over the past several years  we have improved our cash flows from operating activities and continue to work towards our long term goal of sustained positive cash flows from operating activities 
we believe  based on current projections and the current nature of our business  that we have the required resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements including any investment in selling and marketing activities to increase public awareness in the system one  research and development activities to develop new products and enhance our existing products and our centers of excellence initiative 
our ongoing cash requirements include funding normal working capital requirements including inventory and field equipment assets 
field equipment assets include system one equipment rented to customers in the home market 
table of contents and our service pool of equipment which is equipment owned and maintained by us that is swapped for equipment owned or rented by our customers that needs repair or maintenance 
while a majority of our home market customers have committed to purchase  rather than rent  the significant majority of their future system one equipment requirements thereby reducing our working capital cash requirements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to expand or sustain this level of equipment placements that are purchased rather than rented 
additionally  any excess rental or service swap equipment would increase our working capital requirements 
investments in purchases of property and equipment have increased within the last two years as a result of our efforts to rationalize  consolidate and expand our manufacturing operations 
the level of investment in property and equipment in the future will be dependent on our manufacturing requirements for existing and new products and the level of activity with respect to our centers of excellence initiative 
we have a loan and security agreement with svb for a million revolving line of credit with an original maturity date of april  on may   we entered into an amendment to this agreement which extended the maturity date to march  and reduced the interest rate on borrowings to prime with a floor of 
financial covenants and other terms remain essentially unchanged 
the agreement  as amended  has certain financial covenants  contains certain customary events of default and is secured by all or substantially all of our assets 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants  there were no outstanding borrowings against the credit commitment  and we had million of the credit commitment available for borrowing 
on may   we repaid in full all principal and interest in the aggregate amount of million under our term loan and security agreement dated june  with asahi through the issuance of  shares of our common stock  which after the retention by the company of  shares for the payment of certain minimum withholding taxes  resulted in a net issuance to asahi of  shares 
as a result  the term loan and security agreement was terminated 
the shares were issued pursuant to a subscription  sale and purchase agreement between us and asahi dated may  in connection with the issuance of the shares  we entered into a registration rights agreement with asahi 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  subject to certain conditions  we were required to register these shares for resale under a registration statement filed with the sec  which we have done  and to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration statement continuously effective until such time as all of the shares have been publicly sold or may be sold pursuant to rule without restrictions  whichever is earlier 
pursuant to our dialyzer production agreement entered into in may with asahi we agreed to oversee the construction of a new manufacturing facility in germany funded by asahi and operate the facility upon its completion 
construction was completed during the fourth quarter of at which time we began manufacturing dialyzers in this new facility for our own use and for sale to asahi 
we are required to pay asahi a fixed amount per dialyzer manufactured for our own use in the new facility  with such payments capped at fifty percent of the cost of the new facility paid by asahi  or approximately million 
if the agreement is terminated by us  asahi has the option to require us to purchase the new facility from them or if the agreement is terminated by asahi  we have the option to purchase the new facility from them 
in either case the purchase price is equal to one hundred percent of the then net book value of the new facility  as calculated in accordance with gaap 
we maintain postemployment benefit plans for employees in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the plans provide lump sum benefits  payable based on statutory regulations for voluntary or involuntary termination

net cash provided by used in operating activities increased by million during net loss after adjustments for non cash charges  such as depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense  had a favorable impact on cash flows increasing to a positive million during versus a positive million during additionally  working capital requirements decreased with lower inventory requirements and higher total liabilities relative to the prior year  including accrued expenses and other liabilities 
we expect working capital to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to various factors including inventory requirements and timing of payments from our customers and to our vendors 
cash flow from deferred revenues decreased million during compared to  reflecting an increase of million of amortization of deferred revenues into revenues from million during to million during and lower sales of new home equipment during compared to as a result of the timing of patient additions and the timing of conversion of rental equipment to sold equipment 
non cash transfers from inventory to field equipment for the placement of units with our customers decreased million during compared to non cash transfers from field equipment to deferred costs of revenues decreased million during compared to these activities fluctuate due to the timing of home patient additions  efficiencies in our customers utilization of purchased equipment and equipment levels required for our service pool 
net cash used in investing activities 
for each of the periods above  net cash used in investing activities reflected purchases of property and equipment  primarily for our manufacturing facilities as a result of our efforts to rationalize  consolidate and expand our manufacturing operations  along with purchases of equipment for research and development and information technology 
the increase of million in purchases of property and equipment during compared to was driven by capital improvements to and expansion of certain of our manufacturing facilities to accommodate the increased demand for our streamline blood tubing sets and capital spending on our new corporate headquarters

the contractual commitments included in the table above do not include postemployment benefit obligations and unrecognized tax benefits 
we maintain postemployment benefit plans for employees in certain foreign subsidiaries and may be required to make cash outlays related to the settlement of these obligations 
however  the timing of such cash outlays is uncertain 
please see footnote to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for further details 
we may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
please see footnote to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for further details 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales and services when earned 
revenues are recognized when a there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the product has been shipped or services and supplies have been provided to the customer  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents certain agreements with distributors allow for product returns and credits 
for shipment of product sold to distributors  revenue is recognized at the time of sale if a reasonable estimate of future returns or credit can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of future returns or credit cannot be made  we recognize revenue using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  revenue and related costs of revenue is deferred until the final resale of such products to end customers 
in addition to contractually determined volume discounts  in many agreements we offer rebates based on sales to specific end customers and discounts for early payment 
rebates and discounts are recorded as a reduction of sales and trade accounts receivable  based on our best estimate of the amount of probable future rebate or discount on current sales 
we enter into multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of equipment  related disposables and services 
effective january   we adopted accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  as required  using the prospective method as permitted under the guidance 
accordingly  this guidance is being applied to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  the impact of adopting this amended guidance on our results of operations has been limited to products sold internationally through distributors in the system one segment  which revenue has not been significant in the current or historical periods 
asu no 
amended the previous guidance for multiple element arrangements 
pursuant to the amended guidance in asu our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer  and the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective selling price  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
under the amended guidance we determine selling price using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price is used 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists for a unit of accounting  we use best estimated selling price besp 
we generally expect that we will not be able to establish third party evidence due to the nature of our products and the markets in which we compete  and  as such  we typically will determine selling price using vsoe or besp 
we determine besp for an individual element based on consideration of both market and company specific factors  including the selling price and profit margin for similar products  the cost to produce the deliverable and the anticipated margin on that deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold 
the adoption of the amended guidance did not change the accounting for arrangements entered into prior to january  therefore  these arrangements with multiple elements were divided into separate units of accounting if there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items and if other criteria were met  including whether the delivered element had stand alone value to the customer 
if either criteria were not met  the arrangement was accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the fees received upon the completion of delivery of equipment were deferred and are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our remaining obligation and direct costs relating to the delivered equipment are amortized over the same period as the related revenue  while disposable products revenue is recognized on a monthly basis upon delivery 
system one segment we derive revenue in the home market from the sales of hemodialysis therapy to customers in which the customer either purchases or rents the system one and or pureflow sl hardware and purchases a specified number of disposable products and service 
for customers that purchase the system one and pureflow sl hardware  in the home us market  due to the depot service model whereby equipment requiring service is picked up and a replacement device is shipped to 
table of contents the site of care  we recognize fees received from equipment sale as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our remaining service obligation and direct costs relating to the delivered equipment are deferred and amortized over the same expected period as the related revenue 
disposable products revenue is recognized on a monthly basis upon delivery 
under the rental arrangements revenue is recognized on a monthly basis in accordance with agreed upon contract terms and pursuant to binding customer purchase orders and fixed payment terms 
our sales arrangements with our international distributors are structured as direct product sales and have no significant post delivery obligations with the exception of standard warranty obligations 
however  under the previous guidance  for arrangements entered into prior to january  we determined that we could not account for the sale of equipment as a separate unit of accounting and  therefore  the fees received upon the completion of delivery of equipment were deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our remaining service obligation and direct costs relating to the delivered equipment were amortized over the same expected period as the related revenue 
under the amended guidance  for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january   we will recognize revenues and related direct costs upon delivery in accordance with contract terms 
disposable product revenue is recognized on a monthly basis upon delivery under both the previous and amended guidance 
in the critical care market  we structure sales of the system one and disposable products as direct product sales and have no significant post delivery obligations with the exception of standard warranty obligations 
revenue from direct product sales is recognized upon delivery in accordance with contract terms 
certain of these arrangements provide for training  technical support and extended warranty services to our customers 
we recognize training and technical support revenue when the related services are performed 
in the case of extended warranty  the service revenue is recognized ratably over the warranty period 
in center segment our in center segment sales are structured as direct product sales primarily through distributors  and we have no significant post delivery obligations with the exception of standard warranty obligations 
revenue from direct product sales is recognized upon delivery in accordance with contract terms 
some of our distribution contracts for the in center segment contain minimum volume commitments with negotiated pricing discounts at different volume tiers 
each agreement may be canceled upon a material breach  subject to certain curing rights  and in many instances minimum volume commitments can be reduced or eliminated upon certain events 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or estimated market 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and related cost and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on remaining shelf life and estimated forecast of product demand 
we also review our inventory value to determine if it reflects lower of cost or market  with market determined based on net realizable value 
appropriate consideration is given to inventory items sold at negative gross margins  purchase commitments and other factors in evaluating net realizable value 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid development and technological advances as well as regulatory and quality manufacturing guidelines that could result in obsolescence of inventory 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate 
field equipment field equipment consists of equipment being utilized under disposable based rental agreements as well as service pool cyclers 
service pool cyclers are cyclers owned and maintained by us that are swapped for cyclers that need repairs or maintenance by us while being rented or owned by a patient 
we continually monitor the number of cyclers in the service pool  as well as cyclers that are in transit or otherwise not being used by a patient  and assess whether there are any indicators of impairment for such equipment 
we also review field 
table of contents equipment carrying value for reasonableness 
we consider factors such as actual equipment disposals and our ability to verify the equipment s existence in the field to identify lost equipment 
charges for lost equipment are included in distribution expenses 
we capitalize field equipment at cost and amortize field equipment through cost of revenues using the straight line method over an estimated useful life 
we review the estimated useful life of our field equipment periodically for reasonableness and make changes when appropriate 
factors considered in determining the reasonableness of the useful life include expected future design improvements  equipment age and actual equipment disposals 
accounting for stock based awards stock based compensation expense is estimated as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which generally equals the vesting period  based on the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimating the fair value for stock options requires judgment  including the expected term of our stock options  volatility of our stock  expected dividends  risk free interest rates over the expected term of the options and the expected forfeiture rate 
in connection with our performance based programs  we make assumptions principally related to the number of awards that are expected to vest after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met 
valuation of intangibles and other long lived assets for our long lived assets including intangible assets  we assess the carrying value of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future results  significant negative industry factors and significant changes in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long lived assets 
if an impairment review is triggered  we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
this test includes first a qualitative assessment and then  if necessary  a quantitative assessment to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
factors considered in the qualitative assessment include  but are not limited to  both macroeconomic conditions and entity specific conditions 
for the quantitative assessment  the reporting unit s fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach 
our reporting units are our system one and in center operating segments 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments including the identification of reporting units and determination of the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units based on estimates of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon various factors including the positive performance of our reporting units and positive industry and economic trends 
accounting for income taxes we periodically assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
if our 
table of contents judgment as to the likely resolution of the position changes  if the matter is ultimately settled or if the statute of limitation expires  the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change  resolution or expiration occurs 
we conduct business globally and file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  various states and foreign jurisdictions 
we evaluate the need for foreign income tax provisions or reserves based on our evaluation of inter company transfer pricing 
we evaluate the need for valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets based on positive and negative evidence about our ability to realize deferred tax attributes 
we have accumulated significant losses since our inception in utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to limitations and certain tax years in the respective tax jurisdictions remain open to examination 
recent accounting pronouncements a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk is currently limited to our investments 
however  this risk is mitigated given our investment portfolio currently consists of treasury obligation money market funds 
we manage our investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
our investment policy specifies the credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our revenues and a majority of our expenses are denominated in us dollars 
however  we operate a manufacturing and research facility in germany  a manufacturing and service facility in mexico and a manufacturing facility in italy and we purchase materials for those facilities and pay our employees at those facilities in euros and pesos 
in addition  we purchase products for resale in the us from foreign companies and have agreed to pay them in currencies other than the us dollar  including the euro and the thai baht 
as a result  we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  a hypothetical adverse change in the euro  peso and thai baht could have the effect of reducing our gross profit by approximately million 
to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations certain of our long term supply agreements include foreign exchange risk sharing at different exchange rate levels limiting our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
in we also began using foreign exchange forward contracts on peso denominated expenses to further reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
these contracts are entered into with large financial institutions and have a duration of up to twelve months 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value  with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in cost of revenues in the same period as the related hedged item is recognized 
as of december   the notional amount of our outstanding contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was approximately million 
based on our analysis  a hypothetical adverse foreign exchange rate movement of percent against our contracts would have resulted in a net loss in fair value of these contracts of approximately million 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to certain foreign currency denominated receivable and payable balances 
we utilize natural hedges to mitigate this exposure
