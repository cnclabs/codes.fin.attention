our major areas of technical capability include systems architecture and development  network engineering  cyber security  and cloud analytics and tools contracts our portfolio of contracts is highly diversified consisting of a range of contract vehicles through which our clients may contract for our services  with no single contract accounting for more than of our revenue in any of fiscal  fiscal  or fiscal  and no single task order under any contract accounting for more than of our revenue in any of fiscal  fiscal  or fiscal there are two predominant contracting methods by which the us government procures services definite contracts and indefinite contract vehicles 
each of these is described below definite contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products 
the us government procures services and solutions through single award  definite contracts that specify the scope of services that will be delivered and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services 
when an agency recognizes a need for services or products  it develops an acquisition plan  which details the means by which it will procure those services or products 
during the acquisition process  the agency may release a request for information to determine if qualified bidders exist  a draft request for a proposal to allow industry to comment on the scope of work and acquisition strategy  and finally a formal request for a proposal 
following the evaluation of submitted proposals  the agency will award the contract to the winning bidder 
indefinite contract vehicles provide for the issuance by the client of orders for services or products under the terms of the contract 
indefinite contracts are formally known as id iq contracts and are often referred to as contract vehicles or ordering contracts 
id iq contracts may be awarded to one contractor single award or several contractors multiple award 
under a multiple award id iq contract  there is no guarantee of work as contract holders must compete for individual work orders 
id iq contracts will often include pre established labor categories and rates  and the ordering process is streamlined usually taking less than a month from recognition of a need to an established order with a contractor 
id iq contracts often have multi year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts  thereby enabling but not committing the us government to purchase substantial amounts of products and services from one or more contractors in a streamlined procurement process 
gwacs and gsa schedules are id iq contracts that are open to all us government agencies 
contract holders compete for individual task orders under both types of id iq contract vehicles 
prices labor rates are pre established under gsa schedules  while prices under gwacs may be pre established or determined by task order proposal 
agencies may solicit companies directly under gsa schedules and  under gwacs  must work through the agency that operates the gwac or receive a delegation of authority to use the gwac 
gsa schedules are administered by the general services administration and support a wide range of products and services 
gwacs are used to procure it products and services and are administered by the agency soliciting the services or products  with permission from the office of management and budget

funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized  less revenue previously recognized on these contracts 
unfunded backlog 
unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
priced options 
priced contract options represent of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
backlog does not include any task orders under id iq contracts  including gwacs and gsa schedules  except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts 
the following table summarizes the value of our contract backlog at the respective dates presented as of march  in millions funded unfunded priced options total backlog reflects a reduction by management to the revenue value of orders for services under two existing single award id iq contracts the company has had for several years  based on an established pattern of funding under these contracts by the us government 
we may never realize all of the revenue that is included in our total backlog  and there is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog and priced options

risk factors risks related to our business we may not realize the full value of our backlog  which may result in lower than expected revenue 
competition due to its size  the government services market is highly fragmented  and competition within the government professional services industry has intensified 
in addition to professional service companies like our own that focus principally on the provision of services to the us government  other companies active in our markets include large defense contractors  diversified consulting  technology  and outsourcing service providers  and small businesses 
changing government policies and market dynamics are also helping to reshape the competitive landscape 
some large prime contractors are beginning to divest their professional services business units due to the us government s increased sensitivity to organizational conflicts of interest and these divested companies will be free to compete with us without their former organizational conflicts of interest constraints 
the formal adoption of the federal acquisition regulation  or far  organizational conflicts of interest rules or additional more restrictive rules by us government agencies could cause further such divestitures which could further increase competition in our markets 
at the other end of the spectrum are small businesses 
small businesses are growing in the government services industry due in large part to a push by both the obama and bush administrations to bolster the economy by helping small business owners 
finally  due to the foregoing factors and the drive in our markets to quickly build competencies in growth areas and achieve economies of scale  we believe that consolidation activity among market participants will increase 
in the course of doing business  we compete and collaborate with companies of all types and sizes 
we strive to maintain positive and productive relationships with these organizations 
some of them hire us as a subcontractor  and we hire some of them to work with us as our subcontractors 
our major competitors include i contractors focused principally on the provision of services to the us government  such as caci international  inc  l communications holdings  inc  mantech international corp  sra international  inc  and tasc inc  ii large defense contractors which provide both products and services to the us government  such as general dynamics corp  lockheed martin corp  northrop grumman corp  and raytheon co  and iii diversified service providers  such as accenture  computer sciences corp  deloitte consulting llp  and saic  inc we compete on the basis of our technical expertise and client knowledge  our ability to successfully recruit appropriately skilled and experienced talent  our ability to deliver cost effective multi faceted services in a timely manner  our reputation and relationship with our clients  past performance  security clearances  and the size and scale of our company 
in addition  in order to maintain our competitive position  we routinely review our operating structure  capabilities and strategy to determine whether we are effectively meeting the needs of existing clients  effectively responding to developments in our markets  and successfully building a platform intended to provide the foundation for the future growth of our business 
patents and proprietary information our management and technology consulting services and related products are not generally dependent upon patent protection 
we claim a proprietary interest in certain of our service offerings and related products  methodologies  and know how 
we have a few patents but we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on the protection of such patents 
additionally  we have a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive position  and we endeavor to protect this proprietary information 
while protecting trade secrets and proprietary information is important  we are not materially dependent on any specific trade secret or group of trade secrets

regulation as a contractor to the us government  as well as state and local governments  we are heavily regulated in most fields in which we operate 
we deal with numerous us government agencies and entities  and when working with these and other entities  we must comply with and are affected by unique laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration  and performance of us government contracts 
some significant laws and regulations that affect us include far  and agency regulations supplemental to the far  which regulate the formation  administration  and performance of us government contracts 
for example  far requires contractors to establish a code of business ethics and conduct  implement a comprehensive internal control system  and report to the government when the contractor has credible evidence that a principal  employee  agent  or subcontractor  in connection with a government contract  has violated certain federal criminal laws  violated the civil false claims act  or has received a significant overpayment  the false claims act and false statements act  which impose civil and criminal liability for presenting false or fraudulent claims for payments or reimbursement  and making false statements to the us government  respectively  the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with the negotiation of a contract  modification  or task order  the procurement integrity act  which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and certain internal government procurement sensitive information  and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government procurement officials  post government employment laws and regulations  which restrict the ability of a contractor to recruit and hire current employees of the us government and deploy former employees of the us government  laws  regulations  and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes or determined to be controlled unclassified information or for official use only and the export of certain products  services  and technical data  including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work  laws  regulations  and executive orders regulating the handling  use  and dissemination of personally identifiable information in the course of performing a us government contract  laws  regulations  and executive orders governing organizational conflicts of interest that may restrict our ability to compete for certain us government contracts because of the work that we currently perform for the us government or may require that we take measures such as firewalling off certain employees or restricting their future work activities due to the current work that they perform under a us government contract  the contractor business systems rule  which authorizes department of defense clients to withhold a portion of our payments if we are determined to have a significant deficiency in our accounting  cost estimating  purchasing  earned value management  material management and accounting  and or property management system  and the cost accounting standards and cost principles  which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based us government contracts and require consistency of accounting practices over time 
given the magnitude of our revenue derived from contracts with the department of defense  the defense contract audit agency  or dcaa  is our cognizant government audit agency 
the dcaa audits the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies including  among other areas  compensation 
as a result of its audits  the dcaa may determine that a portion of our employee compensation is unallowable 
see item a 
risk factors risk related to our industry our contracts  performance and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits  reviews  investigations and cost adjustments by the us government  which could reduce our revenue  disrupt our business or otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the us government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time 
in order to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  all of our employees are required to attend ethics training at least annually  as well as other compliance training relevant to their position 
internationally  we are subject to special us government laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act  local government regulations and procurement policies and practices  including regulations relating to import export control  investments  exchange controls  and repatriation of earnings  as well as varying currency  political  and economic risks 
us government contracts are  by their terms  subject to termination by the us government either for its convenience or default by the contractor 
in addition  us government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations 
congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a september fiscal year basis  even though contract performance may take many years 
as is common in the industry  our company is subject to business risks  including changes in governmental appropriations  national defense policies  service modernization plans  and availability of funds 
any of these factors could materially adversely affect our company s business with the us government in the future 
the us government has a broad range of actions that it can instigate in order to enforce its procurement policies 
these include proposing a contractor or certain of its operations for debarment or suspending or debarring a contractor or certain of its operations from future government business 
on february   our san antonio office was proposed for debarment by the us air force and listed on the government s excluded parties list system epls website 
although the government s action did not terminate ongoing work under existing contracts  it affected the ability of our san antonio office to attain new government business 
this matter arose from actions of a former government employee hired by us who inappropriately retained and shared sensitive information about a pending government procurement in violation of the company s policies and high standards of ethical conduct 
on april   our operating subsidiary  booz allen hamilton inc  entered in an administrative agreement with the us air force  which lifted the proposed debarment and removed our san antonio office from the us government s excluded parties list system 
as a result  our san antonio office is now eligible to compete for new contracts with the us federal government 
pursuant to the administrative agreement  we accepted responsibility for the incident that gave rise to the proposed debarment and related matters 
in addition  we agreed to implement firm wide enhancements to our ethics and compliance program  including future improvements identified by external advisors  to significantly mitigate the possibility of a re occurrence of such issues 
during the three year term of the administrative agreement  which began on april  or  if the air force determines at any time during such three year period that the company is not fully compliant with the administrative agreement  from the reestablishment of full compliance as determined by the air force  we have agreed  among other things  to file quarterly reports with the air force regarding the implementation of our remedial measures and adhere to a number of provisions relating to the disclosure of violations of the law or employee misconduct under our ethics and compliance program 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations  some of which are highly complex  and our failure to comply could result in fines or civil or criminal penalties or suspension or debarment by the us government that could result in our inability to continue to work on or receive us government contracts  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations

risk factors you should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below  as well as other information included in this annual report  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
this annual report also contains forward looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of specific factors  including the risks and uncertainties described below 
risks related to our business we depend on contracts with us government agencies for substantially all of our revenue 
if our relationships with such agencies are harmed  our future revenue and operating profits would decline 
the us government is our primary client  with revenue from contracts and task orders  either as a prime or a subcontractor  with us government agencies accounting for of our revenue for fiscal our belief is that the successful future growth of our business will continue to depend primarily on our ability to be awarded work under us government contracts  as we expect this will be the primary source of all of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
for this reason  any issue that compromises our relationship with the us government generally or any us government agency that we serve would cause our revenue to decline 
among the key factors in maintaining our relationship with us government agencies are our performance on contracts and task orders  the strength of our professional reputation  compliance with applicable laws and regulations  and the strength of our relationships with client personnel 
in addition  the mishandling or the perception of mishandling of sensitive information  such as our failure to maintain the confidentiality of the existence of our business relationships with certain of our clients or a failure to maintain adequate protection against security breaches  including those resulting from cyber attacks  could harm our relationship with us government agencies 
if a client is not satisfied with the quality or type of work performed by us  a subcontractor  or other third parties who provide services or products for a specific project  the client might seek to terminate the contract prior to its scheduled expiration date  provide a negative assessment of our performance to government maintained contractor past performance data repositories  fail to award us additional business under existing contracts or otherwise  and direct future business to our competitors 
furthermore  we may incur additional costs to address any such situation and the profitability of that work might be impaired 
to the extent that our performance does not meet client expectations  or our reputation or relationships with any of our clients is impaired  our revenue and operating profits could materially decline 
us government spending and mission priorities could change in a manner that adversely affects our future revenue and limits our growth prospects 
our business depends upon continued us government expenditures on defense  intelligence  and civil programs for which we provide support 
these expenditures have not remained constant over time  have been reduced in certain periods and  recently  have been affected by the us government s efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting federal government programs generally 
our business  prospects  financial condition  or operating results could be materially harmed  among other causes  by the following budgetary constraints  including congressionally mandated automatic spending cuts  affecting us government spending generally  or specific agencies in particular  and changes in available funding  a shift in expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support  reduced us government outsourcing of functions that we are currently contracted to provide  including as a result of increased insourcing  further efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting federal government programs  changes in us government programs that we support or related requirements  a continuation of recent efforts by the us government to decrease spending for management support service contracts  us government shutdowns due to a failure by elected officials to fund the government such as that which was threatened in march of or which occurred during government fiscal year or weather related closures in the washington  dc area such as that which occurred in october and other potential delays in the appropriations process  us government agencies awarding contracts on a technically acceptable lowest cost basis in order to reduce expenditures  delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices  an inability by the us government to fund its operations as a result of a failure to increase the federal government s debt ceiling  a credit downgrade of us government obligations or for any other reason  and changes in the political climate and general economic conditions  including a slowdown of the economy or unstable economic conditions and responses to conditions  such as emergency spending  that reduce funds available for other government priorities 
the us government budget deficits  the national debt  and the prevailing economic condition  and actions taken to address them  could continue to negatively affect the us government expenditures on defense  intelligence  and civil programs for which we provide support 
the department of defense is one of our significant clients and cost cutting  including through consolidation and elimination of duplicative organizations and insourcing  has become a major initiative for the department of defense 
in particular  the secretary of defense directed the department of defense to reduce funding for service support contractors by per year from to furthermore  the budget control act of as amended by the american taxpayer relief act requires a ten year billion reduction to baseline spending of the department of defense and provides for automatic spending cuts referred to as sequestration totaling approximately trillion between and  including an estimated billion in federal defense spending cuts over this time period 
the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act   which provides funding for federal government agencies through the end of the current us government fiscal year ending september   implements the approximately billion in mandated sequestration cuts  including approximately billion in reduced funding to the department of defense 
there remains uncertainty as to how exactly budget cuts  including sequestration  will impact us  and we are therefore unable to predict the extent of the impact of such cuts on our business and results of operations 
however  a reduction in the amount of services that we are contracted to provide to the department of defense as a result of any of these related initiatives  legislation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  in response to an office of management and budget mandate  government agencies have reduced management support services spending by approximately billion since if federal awards for management support services continue to decline  our revenue and operating profits may materially decline and further efforts by the office of management and budget to decrease federal awards for management support services could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
these or other factors could cause our defense  intelligence  or civil clients to decrease the number of new contracts awarded generally and fail to award us new contracts  reduce their purchases under our existing contracts  exercise their right to terminate our contracts  or not exercise options to renew our contracts  any of which could cause a material decline in our revenue 
we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations  some of which are highly complex  and our failure to comply could result in fines or civil or criminal penalties or suspension or debarment by the us government that could result in our inability to continue to work on or receive us government contracts  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
as a us government contractor  we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration  and performance of us government contracts  which affect how we do business with our clients 
such laws and regulations may potentially impose added costs on our business and our failure to comply with them may lead to civil or criminal penalties  termination of our us government contracts  and or suspension or debarment from contracting with federal agencies 
some significant laws and regulations that affect us include far  and agency regulations supplemental to the far  which regulate the formation  administration  and performance of us government contracts 
for example  far requires contractors to establish a code of business ethics and conduct  implement a comprehensive internal control system  and report to the government when the contractor has credible evidence that a principal  employee  agent  or subcontractor  in connection with a government contract  has violated certain federal criminal laws  violated the civil false claims act  or has received a significant overpayment  the false claims act and false statements act  which impose civil and criminal liability for presenting false or fraudulent claims for payments or reimbursement  and making false statements to the us government  respectively  the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with the negotiation of a contract  modification  or task order  post government employment laws and regulations  which restrict the ability of a contractor to recruit  hire  and deploy former employees of the us government  laws  regulations  and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products  services  and technical data  including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work  and the far cost accounting standards and cost principles  which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based us government contracts and require consistency of accounting practices over time 
in addition  the us government adopts new laws  rules  and regulations from time to time that could have a material impact on our results of operations 
our performance under our us government contracts and our compliance with the terms of those contracts and applicable laws and regulations are subject to periodic audit  review  and investigation by various agencies of the us government and the current environment has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and sanctions for non compliance by such agencies generally 
in addition  from time to time we report potential or actual violations of applicable laws and regulations to the relevant governmental authority 
any such report of a potential or actual violation of applicable laws or regulations could lead to an audit  review  or investigation by the relevant agencies of the us government 
if such an audit  review  or investigation uncovers a violation of a law or regulation  or improper or illegal activities relating to our us government contracts  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions  including the termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  the triggering of price reduction clauses  withholding of payments  suspension of payments  fines and suspension  or debarment from contracting with us government agencies 
such penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in the industry and there is inherent uncertainty as to the outcome of any particular audit  review  or investigation 
if we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation  our profitability  cash position  and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
further  if the us government were to initiate suspension or debarment proceedings against us or if we are indicted for or convicted of illegal activities relating to our us government contracts following an audit  review  or investigation  we may lose our ability to be awarded contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts for a period of time which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we could also suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us  which would impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts 
see item business regulation 
we derive a majority of our revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process  and our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively in the process or if there are delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us 
we derive a majority of our revenue from us government contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes 
we do not expect this to change for the foreseeable future 
our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
the competitive bidding process involves risk and significant costs to businesses operating in this environment  including the necessity to expend resources  make financial commitments such as procuring leased premises and bid on engagements in advance of the completion of their design  which may result in unforeseen difficulties in execution  cost overruns and  in the case of an unsuccessful competition  the loss of committed costs  the substantial cost and managerial time and effort spent to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us  the ability to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to service any contract we are awarded  the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge contract awards made to us pursuant to competitive bidding  and the risk that any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications  or in termination  reduction  or modification of the awarded contract  and any opportunity cost of bidding and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursue 
in circumstances where contracts are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire  we still may not be provided the opportunity to bid on those contracts if the us government determines to extend the existing contract 
if we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process  we may not be able to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for the duration of those contracts to the extent that there is no additional demand for such services 
an inability to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the current competitive environment has resulted in an increase in the number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards 
it can take many months for the relevant us government agency to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive 
bid protests may result in significant expense to us  contract modification or loss of an awarded contract as a result of the award being overturned 
even where we do not lose the awarded contract  the resulting delay in the start up and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated 
we may lose gsa schedules or our position as a prime contractor on one or more of our gwacs 
we believe that one of the key elements of our success is our position as the holder of gsa schedules  and as a prime contractor under two gwacs as of march  our ability to maintain our existing business and win new business depends on our ability to maintain our position as a gsa schedule contractor and a prime contractor on gwacs 
the loss of any of our gsa schedules or our prime contractor position on any of our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to win new business and our operating results 
in addition  if the us government elects to use a contract vehicle that we do not hold  we will not be able to compete for work under that contract vehicle as a prime contractor 
we may earn less revenue than projected  or no revenue  under certain of our contracts 
many of our contracts with our clients are id iq contracts  including gsa schedules and gwacs 
id iq contracts provide for the issuance by the client of orders for services or products under the contract  and often contain multi year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts  which allow but do not commit the us government to purchase products and services from contractors 
our ability to generate revenue under each of these types of contracts depends upon our ability to be awarded task orders for specific services by the client 
id iq contracts may be awarded to one contractor single award or several contractors multiple award 
multiple contractors must compete under multiple award id iq contracts for task orders to provide particular services  and contractors earn revenue only to the extent that they successfully compete for these task orders 
in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  our revenue under our gsa schedules and gwacs accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
a failure to be awarded task orders under such contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate or otherwise recover the expenses  time  and resources for our contracts 
we enter into three general types of us government contracts for our services cost reimbursable  time and materials  and fixed price 
for fiscal  we derived of our revenue from cost reimbursable contracts  from time and materials contracts and from fixed price contracts 
each of these types of contracts  to varying degrees  involves the risk that we could underestimate our cost of fulfilling the contract  which may reduce the profit we earn or lead to a financial loss on the contract and adversely affect our operating results 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs up to a ceiling and paid a fee  which may be fixed or performance based 
if our actual costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or applicable regulations  we may not be able to recover those costs 
in particular  there is increasing focus by the us government on the extent to which government contractors  including us  are able to receive reimbursement for employee compensation 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain allowable expenses 
we assume financial risk on time and materials contracts because our costs of performance may exceed these negotiated hourly rates 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a pre determined price 
compared to time and materials and cost reimbursable contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities because we receive the benefits of any cost savings  but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of any cost overruns 
the us government has generally indicated that it intends to increase its use of fixed price contract procurements 
because we assume the risk for cost overruns and contingent losses on fixed price contracts  an increase in the percentage of fixed price contracts in our contract mix would increase our risk of suffering losses 
additionally  our profits could be adversely affected if our costs under any of these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract 
we have recorded provisions in our consolidated financial statements for losses on our contracts  as required under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  but our contract loss provisions may not be adequate to cover all actual losses that we may incur in the future 
our professional reputation is critical to our business  and any harm to our reputation could decrease the amount of business the us government does with us  which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and growth prospects 
we depend on our contracts with us government agencies for substantially all of our revenue and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed  our future revenue and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected 
our reputation and relationship with the us government is a key factor in maintaining and growing revenue under contracts with the us government 
negative press reports regarding poor contract performance  employee misconduct  information security breaches  or other aspects of our business  or regarding government contractors generally  could harm our reputation 
if our reputation with these agencies is negatively affected  or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason  such actions would decrease the amount of business that the us government does with us  which would have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and growth prospects 
we use estimates in recognizing revenue and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenue  our profitability may be adversely affected 
revenue from our fixed price contracts is primarily recognized using the percentage of completion method with progress toward completion of a particular contract based on actual costs incurred relative to total estimated costs to be incurred over the life of the contract 
revenue from our cost plus award fee contracts are based on our estimation of award fees over the life of the contract 
estimating costs at completion and award fees on our long term contracts is complex and involves significant judgment 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses  experience is gained  and additional information becomes known  even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change 
any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known 
in the event updated estimates indicate that we will experience a loss on the contract  we recognize the estimated loss at the time it is determined 
additional information may subsequently indicate that the loss is more or less than initially recognized  which requires further adjustments in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in the underlying assumptions  circumstances  or estimates could result in adjustments that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
we may not realize the full value of our backlog  which may result in lower than expected revenue 
as of march   our total backlog was billion  of which billion was funded 
we define backlog to include the following three components funded backlog 
funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized  less revenue previously recognized on these contracts 
unfunded backlog 
unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
priced options 
priced contract options represent of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
backlog does not include any task orders under id iq contracts  including gwacs and gsa schedules  except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts 
we historically have not realized all of the revenue included in our total backlog  and we may not realize all of the revenue included in our total backlog in the future 
there is a somewhat higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog and priced options 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period 
this is because the actual receipt  timing  and amount of revenue under contracts included in backlog are subject to various contingencies  including congressional appropriations  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  delays in the completion of the us government s budgeting process and the use of continuing resolutions could adversely affect our ability to timely recognize revenue under our contracts included in backlog 
furthermore  the actual receipt of revenue from contracts included in backlog may never occur or may be delayed because a program schedule could change or the program could be canceled  a contract s funding or scope could be reduced  modified  delayed  or terminated early  including as a result of a lack of appropriated funds or as a result of cost cutting initiatives and other efforts to reduce us government spending such as the initiatives announced by the secretary of defense in march and or the automatic federal defense spending cuts required by sequestration  in the case of funded backlog  the period of performance for the contract has expired  in the case of unfunded backlog  funding may not be available  or  in the case of priced options  our clients may not exercise their options 
in addition  consulting staff headcount growth is the primary means by which we are able to recognize revenue growth 
any inability to hire additional appropriately qualified personnel or failure to timely and effectively deploy such additional personnel against funded backlog could negatively affect our ability to grow our revenue 
furthermore  even if our backlog results in revenue  the contracts may not be profitable 
we may fail to attract  train and retain skilled and qualified employees with appropriate security clearances  which may impair our ability to generate revenue  effectively serve our clients  and execute our growth strategy 
our business depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly qualified individuals who may have advanced degrees in areas such as information technology as well as appropriate security clearances 
we compete for such qualified personnel with other us government contractors  the us government  and private industry  and such competition is intense 
personnel with the requisites skills  qualifications  or security clearance may be in short supply or generally unavailable 
in addition  our ability to recruit  hire  and internally deploy former employees of the us government is subject to complex laws and regulations  which may serve as an impediment to our ability to attract such former employees  and failure to comply with these laws and regulations may expose us and our employees to civil or criminal penalties 
if we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  or fail to deploy such employees or obtain their appropriate security clearances in a timely manner  our ability to maintain and grow our business and to effectively serve our clients could be limited and our future revenue and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  to the extent that we are unable to make necessary permanent hires to appropriately serve our clients  we could be required to engage larger numbers of contracted personnel  which could reduce our profit margins 
if we are able to attract sufficient numbers of qualified new hires  training and retention costs may place significant demands on our resources 
in addition  to the extent that we experience attrition in our employee ranks  we may realize only a limited or no return on such invested resources  and we would have to expend additional resources to hire and train replacement employees 
the loss of services of key personnel could also impair our ability to perform required services under some of our contracts and to retain such contracts  as well as our ability to win new business 
we may fail to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances which may adversely affect our ability to perform on certain contracts 
many us government programs require contractors to have security clearances 
depending on the level of required clearance  security clearances can be difficult and time consuming to obtain 
if we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances  we may not be able to win new business  and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them 
to the extent we are not able to obtain and maintain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract  we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts  or effectively rebid on expiring contracts  as well as lose existing contracts  which may adversely affect our operating results and inhibit the execution of our growth strategy 
our profitability could suffer if we are not able to timely and effectively utilize our employees 
the cost of providing our services  including the degree to which our employees are utilized  affects our profitability 
the degree to which we are able to utilize our employees in a timely manner or at all is affected by a number of factors  including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire  assimilate  and deploy new employees  our ability to forecast demand for our services and to maintain and deploy headcount that is aligned with demand  including employees with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects  our employees inability to obtain or retain necessary security clearances  our ability to manage attrition  and our need to devote time and resources to training  business development  and other non chargeable activities 
if our employees are under utilized  our profit margin and profitability could suffer 
additionally  if our employees are over utilized  it could have a material adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition  which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business 
we may lose one or more members of our senior management team or fail to develop new leaders  which could cause the disruption of the management of our business 
we believe that the future success of our business and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued contributions of the members of our senior management and the continued development of new members of senior management 
we rely on our senior management to generate business and execute programs successfully 
in addition  the relationships and reputation that many members of our senior management team have established and maintain with our clients are important to our business and our ability to identify new business opportunities 
we do not have any employment agreements providing for a specific term of employment with any member of our senior management 
the loss of any member of our senior management or our failure to continue to develop new members could impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts  to maintain good client relations  and to otherwise manage our business 
our employees or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities  which could harm our ability to conduct business with the us government 
we are exposed to the risk that employee or subcontractor fraud or other misconduct could occur 
misconduct by employees or subcontractors could include intentional or unintentional failures to comply with us government procurement regulations  engaging in unauthorized activities  or falsifying time records 
employee or subcontractor misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or classified information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or classified information 
it is not always possible to deter employee or subcontractor misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses  which could materially harm our business 
as a result of such misconduct  our employees could lose their security clearance and we could face fines and civil or criminal penalties  loss of facility clearance accreditation  and suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government  as well as reputational harm  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
see  for example  item business regulation for a description of the recently resolved debarment proceedings against our san antonio office 
we face intense competition from many competitors  which could cause us to lose business  lower prices and suffer employee departures 
our business operates in a highly competitive industry  and we generally compete with a wide variety of us government contractors  including large defense contractors  diversified service providers  and small businesses 
we also face competition from entrants into our markets including companies divested by large prime contractors in response to increasing scrutiny of organizational conflicts of interest issues and from market participants formed by or benefiting from industry consolidation 
some of these companies possess greater financial resources and larger technical staffs  and others have smaller and more specialized staffs 
these competitors could  among other things divert sales from us by winning very large scale government contracts  a risk that is enhanced by the recent trend in government procurement practices to bundle services into larger contracts  force us to charge lower prices in order to win or maintain contracts  seek to hire our employees  or adversely affect our relationships with current clients  including our ability to continue to win competitively awarded engagements where we are the incumbent 
if we lose business to our competitors or are forced to lower our prices or suffer employee departures  our revenue and our operating profits could decline 
in addition  we may face competition from our subcontractors who  from time to time  seek to obtain prime contractor status on contracts for which they currently serve as a subcontractor to us 
if one or more of our current subcontractors are awarded prime contractor status on such contracts in the future  it could divert sales from us and could force us to charge lower prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
our failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors  or the failure of contractors with which we have entered into a sub or prime contractor relationship to meet their obligations to us or our clients  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
maintaining strong relationships with other us government contractors  who may also be our competitors  is important to our business and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition  and operating results 
to the extent that we fail to maintain good relations with our subcontractors or other prime contractors due to either perceived or actual performance failures or other conduct  they may refuse to hire us as a subcontractor in the future or to work with us as our subcontractor 
in addition  other contractors may choose not to use us as a subcontractor or choose not to perform work for us as a subcontractor for any number of additional reasons  including because they choose to establish relationships with our competitors or because they choose to directly offer services that compete with our business 
as a prime contractor  we often rely on other companies to perform some of the work under a contract  and we expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for portions of our delivery of services and revenue in the foreseeable future 
if our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations  our operating results and future growth prospects could be impaired 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from  among other things  the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor  client concerns about the subcontractor  our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract  or our hiring of a subcontractor s personnel 
in addition  if any of our subcontractors fail to deliver the agreed upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services on a timely basis  our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized 
material losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a client terminating a contract for default 
a termination for default could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
we estimate that revenue derived from contracts under which we acted as a subcontractor to other companies represented of our revenue for fiscal as a subcontractor  we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract  and poor performance on the contract could tarnish our reputation  even when we perform as required  and could cause other contractors to choose not to hire us as a subcontractor in the future 
in addition  if the us government terminates or reduces other prime contractors programs or does not award them new contracts  subcontracting opportunities available to us could decrease  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
adverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes could result in materially adverse monetary damages or injunctive relief and damage our reputation 
we are subject to  and may become a party to  a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
for example  over time  we have had disputes with current and former employees involving alleged violations of civil rights  wage and hour  and worker s compensation laws 
further  as more fully described under item legal proceedings  six former officers and stockholders who had departed the firm prior to the acquisition have filed suits against our company and certain of our current and former directors and officers 
each of the suits arises out of the acquisition and alleges that the former stockholders are entitled to certain payments that they would have received if they had held their stock at the time of acquisition 
the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 
any claims or litigation  even if fully indemnified or insured  could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 
the litigation and other claims described under the item legal proceedings are subject to future developments and management s view of these matters may change in the future 
systems that we develop  integrate  or maintain could experience security breaches which may damage our reputation with our clients and hinder future contract win rates 
many of the systems we develop  integrate  or maintain involve managing and protecting information involved in intelligence  national security  and other sensitive or classified government functions 
the cyber and security threats that our clients face have grown more frequent and sophisticated 
a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business  damage our reputation  and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for us government clients 
damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work or any liability resulting from a security breach in one of the systems we develop  install  or maintain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
internal system or service failures  including as a result of cyber or other security threats  could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients  which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we create  implement  and maintain information technology and engineering systems  and provide services that are often critical to our clients operations  some of which involve classified or other sensitive information and may be conducted in war zones or other hazardous environments 
as a result  we are subject to systems or service failures  not only resulting from our own failures or the failures of third party service providers  natural disasters  power shortages  or terrorist attacks  but also from continuous exposure to cyber and other security threats  including computer viruses  attacks by computer hackers or physical break ins 
there has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the cyber and security threats we face  with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent  which may target us because  as a us government contractor  we hold classified or other sensitive information 
as a result  we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption with respect to classified or other sensitive information resulting from an attack by computer hackers  foreign governments  and cyber terrorists 
we have been the target of these types of attacks in the past and future attacks are likely to occur 
if successful  these types of attacks on our network or other systems or service failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  due to  among other things  the loss of client or proprietary data  interruptions or delays in our clients businesses  and damage to our reputation 
in addition  the failure or disruption of our systems  communications  or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if our systems  services  or other applications have significant defects or errors  are successfully attacked by cyber and other security threats  suffer delivery delays  or otherwise fail to meet our clients expectations  we may lose revenue due to adverse client reaction  be required to provide additional services to a client at no charge  incur additional costs related to monitoring and increasing our cybersecurity  lose revenue due to the deployment of internal staff for remediation efforts instead of client assignments  receive negative publicity  which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients  be unable to successfully market services that are reliant on the creation and maintaining of secure information technology systems to us government  international  and commercial clients  suffer claims for substantial damages  particularly as a result of any successful network or systems breach and exfiltration of client information  or incur significant costs complying with applicable federal or state law  including laws governing protection of personal information 
in addition to any costs resulting from contract performance or required corrective action  these failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenue if they result in clients postponing subsequently scheduled work or canceling or failing to renew contracts 
our errors and omissions insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to some types of future claims 
the successful assertion of any large claim against us could seriously harm our business 
even if not successful  these claims could result in significant legal and other costs  may be a distraction to our management  and may harm our client relationships 
in certain new business areas  we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance and may decide not to accept or solicit business in these areas 
the growth of our us and international business entails risks  including those associated with new relationships  clients  capabilities  service offerings  and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values 
we are focused on growing our presence in our addressable markets by expanding our relationships with existing clients  developing new clients by leveraging our core competencies  further developing our existing capabilities and service offerings and creating new capabilities and service offerings to address our clients emerging needs  and undertaking business development efforts focused on identifying near term developments and long term trends that may pose significant challenges for our clients 
these efforts entail inherent risks associated with innovation and competition from other participants in those areas  potential failure to help our clients respond to the challenges they face  our ability to comply with uncertain evolving legal standards applicable to certain of our service offerings  including those in the cybersecurity area  and  with respect to potential international growth  risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions  such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations and applicable us regulation and economic  legal  and political conditions in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
as we attempt to develop new relationships  clients  capabilities  and service offerings  these efforts could harm our results of operations due to  among other things  a diversion of our focus and resources and actual costs and opportunity costs of pursuing these opportunities in lieu of others and these efforts could ultimately be unsuccessful 
in addition  our ability to grow our business by leveraging our operating model to efficiently and effectively deploy our people across our client base is largely dependent on our ability to maintain our collaborative culture 
to the extent that we are unable to maintain our culture for any reason  we may be unable to grow our business 
any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  with the growth of our us and international operations  we are now providing client services and undertaking business development efforts in numerous and disparate geographic locations both domestically and internationally 
our ability to effectively serve our clients is dependent upon our ability to successfully leverage our operating model across all of these and any future locations  maintain effective management controls over all of our locations to ensure  among other things  compliance with applicable laws  rules and regulations  and instill our core values in all of our personnel at each of these and any future locations 
any inability to ensure any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our international operations are subject to special us government laws and regulations  such as the foreign corrupt practices act  and regulations and procurement policies and practices  including regulations to import export control  which may expose us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 
our international operations are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act  or the fcpa  and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we have operations and deal with governmental customers in countries known to experience corruption  including certain emerging countries in the middle east 
our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees  consultants or contractors that could be in violation of various laws including the fcpa  even though these parties are not always subject to our control 
we are also subject to import export control regulations restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products  services  and technical data  including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work 
if we were to fail to comply with the fcpa or the applicable import export control regulations  we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties  including fines for our company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers  and the possible loss of export or import privileges which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
changes to our operating structure  capabilities or strategy intended to address our clients needs  respond to developments in our markets and grow our business may not be successful 
we routinely review our operating structure  capabilities and strategy to determine whether we are effectively meeting the needs of existing clients  effectively responding to developments in our markets and successfully building a platform intended to provide the foundation for the future growth of our business 
the outcome of any such review is difficult to predict and the extent of changes to our business following such a review  if any  are dependent in part upon the nature and extent of the review 
as disclosed under item business  effective april   we implemented a restructured operating matrix to better align our service offerings and capabilities with our clients needs and better match our addressable markets 
the implementation of these changes  and the implementation of other future changes to our operating structure  capabilities  strategy or any other aspect of our business following an internal review  may materially alter various aspects of our business or our business model as an entirety and there can be no assurance that any such changes will be successful or that they will not ultimately have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we and our subsidiaries may incur debt in the future  which could substantially reduce our profitability  limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities  and reduce the value of your investment 
as of march   we had approximately billion of debt outstanding 
the instruments governing our indebtedness may not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt in the future or other obligations that do not constitute indebtedness  which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks 
in addition  we may  increase the borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit agreement without the consent of any person other than the institutions agreeing to provide all or any portion of such increase  to an amount not to exceed million  subject to certain closing conditions including pro forma compliance with financial covenants 
the amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences  including  but not limited to our ability to satisfy obligations to lenders may be impaired  resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of our indebtedness  our ability to obtain additional financing for refinancing of existing indebtedness  working capital  capital expenditures  product and service development  acquisitions  general corporate purposes  and other purposes may be impaired  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt  we may be increasingly vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates  our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and the industry may be limited  and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to other firms in our industry 
our senior secured credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with them 
our senior secured credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants relating to  among other things  interest coverage and leverage ratios  as well as limitations on mergers  consolidations and dissolutions  sales of assets  investments and acquisitions  indebtedness and liens  dividends  repurchase of shares of capital stock and options to purchase shares of capital stock  transactions with affiliates  sale and leaseback transactions  and restricted payments 
the revolving credit facility matures on december  the tranche a and tranche b term facilities mature on december  and july   respectively 
failure to meet these financial and operating covenants could result from  among other things  changes in our results of operations  the incurrence of debt  or changes in general economic conditions  which may be beyond our control 
these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders  which could harm our business and operations 
many of our contracts with the us government are classified or subject to other security restrictions  which may limit investor insight into portions of our business 
for fiscal  we derived a substantial portion of our revenue from contracts with the us government that are classified or subject to security restrictions that preclude the dissemination of certain information 
in addition  a significant number of our employees have security clearances which preclude them from providing information regarding certain of our clients and services provided to such clients to other of our employees without security clearances and investors 
because we are limited in our ability to provide information about these contracts and services  the various risks associated with these contracts or services or any dispute or claims relating to such contracts or services  you may not have important information concerning our business  which will limit your insight into a substantial portion of our business and therefore may be less able to fully evaluate the risks related to that portion of our business 
if we cannot collect our receivables or if payment is delayed  our business may be adversely affected by our inability to generate cash flow  provide working capital  or continue our business operations 
we depend on the timely collection of our receivables to generate cash flow  provide working capital  and continue our business operations 
if the us government or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of invoices for any reason  our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
the us government may delay or fail to pay invoices for a number of reasons  including lack of appropriated funds  lack of an approved budget  or as a result of audit findings by government regulatory agencies 
some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly fewer financial resources than we do  which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or that payment may be delayed 
recent efforts by the us government to revise its organizational conflict of interest rules could limit our ability to successfully compete for new contracts or task orders  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
recent efforts by the us government to reform its procurement practices have focused  among other areas  on the separation of certain types of work to facilitate objectivity and avoid or mitigate organizational conflicts of interest and the strengthening of regulations governing organizational conflicts of interest 
organizational conflicts of interest may arise from circumstances in which a contractor has impaired objectivity during performance  unfair access to non public information  or the ability to set the ground rules for another procurement for which the contractor competes 
a focus on organizational conflicts of interest issues has resulted in legislation and a proposed regulation aimed at increasing organizational conflicts of interest requirements  including  among other things  separating sellers of products and providers of advisory services in major defense acquisition programs 
in addition  the us government is working to adopt a far rule to address organizational conflicts of interest issues that will apply to all government contractors  including us  in department of defense and other procurements 
a future far rule may also increase the restrictions in current organizational conflicts of interest regulations and rules 
to the extent that proposed and future organizational conflicts of interest laws  regulations  and rules  limit our ability to successfully compete for new contracts or task orders with the us government  either because of organizational conflicts of interest issues arising from our business  or because companies with which we are affiliated  including through carlyle  or with which we otherwise conduct business  create organizational conflicts of interest issues for us  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
acquisitions could result in operating difficulties or other adverse consequences to our business 
as part of our operating strategy  we may continue to selectively pursue acquisitions 
this could pose many risks  including we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates at prices we consider attractive  we may not be able to compete successfully for identified acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  or accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business  future acquisitions may require us to issue common stock or spend significant cash  resulting in dilution of ownership or additional debt leverage  we may have difficulty retaining an acquired company s key employees or clients  we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses  resulting in unforeseen difficulties  such as incompatible accounting  information management  or other control systems  and greater expenses than expected  acquisitions may disrupt our business or distract our management from other responsibilities  as a result of an acquisition  we may incur additional debt and we may need to record write downs from future impairments of intangible assets  each of which could reduce our future reported earnings  and we may have difficulty integrating personnel from the acquired company with our people and our core values 
in connection with any acquisition that we make  there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess  and we may fail to discover any failure of a target company to have fulfilled its contractual obligations to the us government or other clients 
acquired entities may not operate profitably or result in improved operating performance 
additionally  we may not realize anticipated synergies  business growth opportunities  cost savings  and other benefits we anticipate  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
risks related to our industry our us government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government to discontinue contract performance  and if lost contracts are not replaced  our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated 
us government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government clients with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
these rights and remedies allow government clients  among other things  to terminate existing contracts  with short notice  for convenience as well as for default  reduce orders under or otherwise modify contracts  for contracts subject to the truth in negotiations act  reduce the contract price or cost where it was increased because a contractor or subcontractor furnished cost or pricing data during negotiations that was not complete  accurate  and current  for some contracts  i demand a refund  make a forward price adjustment  or terminate a contract for default if a contractor provided inaccurate or incomplete data during the contract negotiation process and ii reduce the contract price under certain triggering circumstances  including the revision of price lists or other documents upon which the contract award was predicated  terminate our facility security clearances and thereby prevent us from receiving classified contracts  cancel multi year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable  decline to exercise an option to renew a multi year contract or issue task orders in connection with id iq contracts  claim rights in solutions  systems  and technology produced by us  appropriate such work product for their continued use without continuing to contract for our services and disclose such work product to third parties  including other us government agencies and our competitors  which could harm our competitive position  prohibit future procurement awards with a particular agency due to a finding of organizational conflicts of interest based upon prior related work performed for the agency that would give a contractor an unfair advantage over competing contractors  or the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor s judgment  subject the award of contracts to protest by competitors  which may require the contracting federal agency or department to suspend our performance pending the outcome of the protest and may also result in a requirement to resubmit offers for the contract or in the termination  reduction  or modification of the awarded contract  suspend or debar us from doing business with the us government  and control or prohibit the export of our services 
recent and potential future budget cuts  the impact of sequestration and recent efforts by the office of management and budget to decrease federal awards for management support services  may cause agencies with which we currently have contracts to terminate  reduce the number of task orders under or fail to renew such contracts 
if a us government client were to unexpectedly terminate  cancel  or decline to exercise an option to renew with respect to one or more of our significant contracts  or suspend or debar us from doing business with the us government  our revenue and operating results would be materially harmed 
the us government may revise its procurement  contract or other practices in a manner adverse to us 
the us government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract laws  rules  and regulations  such as cost accounting standards  organizational conflicts of interest  and other rules governing inherently governmental functions at any time  reduce  delay  or cancel procurement programs resulting from us government efforts to improve procurement practices and efficiency  limit the creation of new government wide or agency specific multiple award contracts  face restrictions or pressure from government employees and their unions regarding the amount of services the us government may obtain from private contractors  award contracts on a technically acceptable lowest cost basis in order to reduce expenditures  and we may not be the lowest cost provider of services  adopt new socio economic requirements  including setting aside funds to small  disadvantaged businesses  change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements  and at its option  terminate or decline to renew our contracts 
in addition  any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenue and profit margin 
in addition  changes to the procurement system could cause delays in the procurement decision making process 
any such changes to the us government s procurement practices or the adoption of new contracting rules or practices could impair our ability to obtain new or re compete contracts and any such changes or increased associated costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
as part of its cost cutting initiative  the department of defense has issued guidance regarding changes to the procurement process that is intended to control cost growth throughout the acquisition cycle by developing a competitive strategy for each program 
because this initiative may significantly change the way the us government solicits  negotiates  and manages its contracts  it could result in an increase in competitive pressure and decreased profitability on contracts and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the us government may prefer minority owned  small and small disadvantaged businesses  therefore  we may not win contracts we bid for 
as a result of the small business administration set aside program  the us government may decide to restrict certain procurements only to bidders that qualify as minority owned  small  or small disadvantaged businesses 
as a result  we would not be eligible to perform as a prime contractor on those programs and would be restricted to a maximum of of the work as a subcontractor on those programs 
an increase in the amount of procurements under the small business administration set aside program may impact our ability to bid on new procurements as a prime contractor or restrict our ability to recomplete on incumbent work that is placed in the set aside program 
our contracts  performance  and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits  reviews  investigations  and cost adjustments by the us government  which could reduce our revenue  disrupt our business or otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operation 
us government agencies routinely audit  review  and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems 
these agencies review our performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards  including applicable government cost accounting standards 
these agencies also review our compliance with government regulations and policies  and the dcaa audits  among other areas  the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies  including our purchasing  property  estimating  earned value and accounting systems 
these internal control systems could focus on significant elements of costs  such as executive compensation 
determination of a significant internal control deficiency by a government agency could result in increased payment withholding that might materially increase our accounts receivable days sales outstanding and adversely affect our cash flow 
in particular  over time the dcma has increased and may continue to increase the proportion of executive compensation that it deems unallowable and the size of the executive population whose compensation is disallowed  which will continue to materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition including the requirement to carry an increased level of reserves 
we recognize as revenue  net of reserves  executive compensation that we determine  based on management estimates  to be allowable  management estimates in this regard are based on a number of factors that may change over time  including executive compensation survey data  our and other government contractors experiences with the dcaa audit practices in our industry and relevant decisions of courts and boards of contract appeals 
any costs found to be unallowable under a contract will not be reimbursed  and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
further  the amount of any such refund may exceed reserves established by management based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
moreover  if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with government imposed requirements  we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts 
unfavorable us government audit  review  or investigation results could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions  and could harm our reputation and relationships with our clients and impair our ability to be awarded new contracts 
for example  if our invoicing system were found to be inadequate following an audit by the dcaa  our ability to directly invoice us government payment offices could be eliminated 
as a result  we would be required to submit each invoice to the dcaa for approval prior to payment  which could materially increase our accounts receivable days sales outstanding and adversely affect our cash flow 
in addition  proposed regulatory changes  if adopted  would require the department of defense s contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels based on assessments of a contractor s business systems 
an unfavorable outcome to an audit  review  or investigation by any us government agency could materially and adversely affect our relationship with the us government 
if a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  withholding of payments  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
provisions that we have recorded in our financial statements as a compliance reserve may not cover actual losses 
furthermore  the disallowance of any costs previously charged could directly and negatively affect our current results of operations for the relevant prior fiscal periods  and we could be required to repay any such disallowed amounts 
each of these results could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
a delay in the completion of the us government s budget process could result in a reduction in our backlog and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
on an annual basis  the us congress must approve budgets that govern spending by each of the federal agencies we support 
when the us congress is unable to agree on budget priorities  and thus is unable to pass the annual budget on a timely basis  the us congress typically enacts a continuing resolution 
a continuing resolution allows government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle 
most recently  in the absence of an annual budget for the government current fiscal year  a continuing resolution that provides funding through the end of september  for certain government agencies and departments was passed by congress  and signed by president obama on march  under a continuing resolution  funding may not be available for new projects 
in particular  the current continuing resolution contains standard restrictions that restrict new program starts and program increases beyond current service levels 
in addition  when government agencies operate on the basis of a continuing resolution  they may delay funding we expect to receive on contracts we are already performing 
any such delays would likely result in new business initiatives being delayed or cancelled and a reduction in our backlog  and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
in addition  a failure to complete the budget process and fund government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution may result in a federal government shutdown 
a shutdown may result in us incurring substantial costs without reimbursement under our contracts and the delay or cancellation of key programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
risks related to our common stock booz allen holding is a holding company with no operations of its own  and it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund all of its operations and expenses  including to make future dividend payments  if any 
the operations of booz allen holding are conducted almost entirely through its subsidiaries and its ability to generate cash to meet its debt service obligations or to pay dividends is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans 
further  our senior secured credit agreement significantly restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us 
in addition  delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock 
our principal stockholder could exert significant influence over our company 
as of march   carlyle  through coinvest  owned shares of our common stock representing approximately of our outstanding voting power excluding shares of common stock with respect to which carlyle has received a voting proxy pursuant to irrevocable proxy and tag along agreements 
under the terms of the irrevocable proxy and tag along agreements carlyle is able to exercise voting power over shares of our common stock owned by a number of other stockholders  including our executive officers  with respect to the election and removal of directors and change of control transactions 
as a result  carlyle will have a controlling influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval  including election and removal of our directors and change of control transactions 
in addition  coinvest is a party to the amended and restated stockholders agreement pursuant to which carlyle has the right to nominate a majority of the members of our board of directors  or our board  and to exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval and our policy and affairs 
in addition  we are a controlled company within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and  as a result  currently intend to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 
the concentrated holdings of funds affiliated with carlyle  certain provisions of the amended and restated stockholders agreement and the presence of carlyle s nominees on our board may result in a delay or the deterrence of possible changes in control of our company  which may reduce the market price of our common stock 
the interests of carlyle may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock 
carlyle is in the business of making investments in companies  and may from time to time in the future acquire controlling interests in businesses engaged in management and technology consulting that complement or directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business 
if carlyle pursues such acquisitions in our industry  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
in addition  to the extent that carlyle acquires a controlling interest in one or more companies that provide services or products to the us government  our affiliation with any such company through carlyle could create organizational conflicts of interest and similar issues for us under federal procurement laws and regulations 
see risks related to our business recent efforts by the us government to revise its organizational conflicts of interest rules could limit our ability to successfully compete for new contracts or task orders  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our financial results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside our control  which could cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate 
our financial results may vary significantly from period to period in the future as a result of many external factors that are outside of our control 
factors that may affect our financial results and that could cause the market price of our outstanding securities  including our class a common stock  to fluctuate include those listed in this risk factors section and others such as any cause of reduction or delay in us government funding  fluctuations in revenue earned on existing contracts  commencement  completion  or termination of contracts during a particular period  a potential decline in our overall profit margins if our other direct costs and subcontract revenue grow at a faster rate than labor related revenue  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as changes to business strategy  strategic investments  acquisitions  divestitures  spin offs  and joint ventures  a change in our contract mix to less profitable contracts  changes in policy or budgetary measures that adversely affect us government contracts in general  variable purchasing patterns under us government gsa schedules  blanket purchase agreements  which are agreements that fulfill repetitive needs under gsa schedules  and id iq contracts  changes in demand for our services and solutions  fluctuations in the degree to which we are able to utilize our professionals  seasonality associated with the us government s fiscal year  an inability to utilize existing or future tax benefits for any reason  including a change in law  alterations to contract requirements  and adverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes 
we cannot assure you that we will pay special or regular dividends on our stock in the future 
the board of directors authorized and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend for each of the last six quarters 
the board of directors also authorized and declared a special cash dividend on may  and july   respectively 
the declaration of any future dividends and the establishment of the per share amount  record dates and payment dates for an such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the board of directors taking into account future earnings  cash flows  financial requirements and other factors 
there can be no assurance that the board of directors will declare any dividends in the future 
to the extent that expectations by market participants regarding the potential payment  or amount  of any special or regular dividend prove to be incorrect  the price of our common stock may be materially and negatively affected and investors that bought shares of our common stock based on those expectations may suffer a loss on their investment 
further  to the extent that we declare a regular or special dividend at a time when market participants hold no such expectations or the amount of any such dividend exceeds current expectations  the price of our common stock may increase and investors that sold shares of our common stock prior to the record date for any such dividend may forego potential gains on their investment 
a majority of our outstanding indebtedness is secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets 
as a result of these security interests  such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our indebtedness and other obligations 
in addition  the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility 
indebtedness under our senior secured credit agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
accordingly  if an event of default were to occur under our senior secured credit agreement  the senior secured lenders under such facilities would have a prior right to our assets  to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  or reorganization 
in that event  our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them including all amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement  resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness 
only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders 
the pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes 
because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements  our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired  which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility 
as of march   we had billion of indebtedness outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement and had million of capacity available for additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit agreement 
in addition  we may  increase the borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit agreement without the consent of any person other than the institutions agreeing to provide all or any portion of such increase  to an amount not to exceed million  subject to certain closing conditions including pro forma compliance with financial covenants 
fulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company  including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the sarbanes oxley act of  is expensive and time consuming and any delays or difficulty in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price 
as a public company  the sarbanes oxley act of and the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the related rules and regulations of the sec  as well as the new york stock exchange rules  require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules 
compliance with these public company obligations requires us to devote significant management time and place significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial  accounting  and information systems 
we have hired additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company reporting experience and technical accounting knowledge 
other expenses associated with being a public company include increased auditing  accounting  and legal fees and expenses  investor relations expenses  increased directors fees and director and officer liability insurance costs  registrar and transfer agent fees  listing fees  as well as other expenses 
in particular  the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with an established internal control framework  and to report on our conclusions as to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
it also requires an independent registered public accounting firm to test our internal control over financial reporting and report on the effectiveness of such controls 
in addition  we are required under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
any failure to maintain effective controls or implement new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
this could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock 
failure to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the sec  the new york stock exchange  or other regulatory authorities 
provisions in our organizational documents and in the delaware general corporation law may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deterring  preventing  or rendering more difficult a change in control of booz allen holding that our stockholders might consider in their best interests 
these provisions include establishment of a classified board  with staggered terms  granting to the board the sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the board  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors if a group  as defined under section d of the exchange act  ceases to own more than of our voting common stock  granting to the board the ability to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval  the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board  a prohibition on stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders  the establishment of advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board at stockholder meetings  requiring approval of two thirds of stockholders to amend the bylaws  and prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent if a group ceases to own more than of our voting common stock 
these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context 
even in the absence of a takeover attempt  the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
in addition  we have opted out of section of the delaware general corporation law  which would have otherwise imposed additional requirements regarding mergers and other business combinations  until carlyle and its affiliates no longer own more than of our class a common stock 
after such time  we will be governed by section our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management 
these provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay  deter  render more difficult  or prevent a change in our control  which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders 
sales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly 
as of march   carlyle owned  shares of our class a common stock  or approximately of our outstanding class a common stock excluding shares of common stock with respect to which carlyle has received a voting proxy pursuant to irrevocable proxy and tag along agreements 
if carlyle sells  or the market perceives that carlyle intends to sell  a substantial portion of its beneficial ownership interest in us in the public market  the market price of our class a common stock could decline significantly 
the sales also could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of march   shares of our class a common stock were outstanding 
in addition to the shares owned by carlyle   shares of our class a common stock which are held by directors  executive officers and other affiliates  are restricted securities within the meaning of rule under the securities act eligible for resale in the public market subject to volume  manner of sale and holding period limitations under rule under the securities act 
 shares of our class a common stock are issuable upon transfer of our class b non voting common stock and class c restricted common stock 
in addition   shares of our class a common stock are issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options granted under our officers rollover stock plan relating to our outstanding class e special voting common stock and  shares of our class a common stock underlying options that are either subject to the terms of our equity incentive plan or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plan are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various option agreements and  to the extent held by affiliates  the volume and manner of sale restrictions of rule if these additional shares are sold  or if it is perceived that they will be sold  in the public market  the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially

item legal proceedings our performance under us government contracts and compliance with the terms of those contracts and applicable laws and regulations are subject to continuous audit  review  and investigation by the us government which may include such investigative techniques as subpoenas or civil investigative demands 
given the nature of our business  these audits  reviews  and investigations may focus  among other areas  on various aspects of procurement integrity  labor time reporting  sensitive and or classified information access and control  executive compensation  and post government employment restrictions 
we are not always aware of our status in such matters  but we are currently aware of certain pending audits and investigations involving labor time reporting  procurement integrity  and classified information access 
on april   we entered into an administrative agreement with the us air force  which lifted the proposed debarment of our san antonio office and removed it from the us government s excluded parties list system 
see item business regulation for additional information 
in addition  from time to time  we are also involved in legal proceedings and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business  including those relating to employment matters  relationships with clients and contractors  intellectual property disputes  and other business matters 
these legal proceedings seek various remedies  including claims for monetary damages in varying amounts that currently range up to million or are unspecified as to amount 
although the outcome of any such matter is inherently uncertain and may be materially adverse  based on current information  we do not expect any of the currently ongoing audits  reviews  investigations  or litigation to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of march  and  there are no material amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements related to these proceedings 
six former officers and stockholders who had departed the firm prior to the acquisition have filed a total of nine suits in various jurisdictions  with original filing dates ranging from july  through december  three of which were amended on july  and then further amended into one consolidated complaint on september   against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers 
each of the suits arises out of the acquisition and alleges that the former stockholders are entitled to certain payments that they would have received if they had held their stock at the time of the acquisition 
some of the suits also allege that the acquisition price paid to stockholders was insufficient 
the various suits assert claims for breach of contract  tortious interference with contract  breach of fiduciary duty  civil racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act  or rico  violations  violations of the employee retirement income security act  or erisa  and or securities and common law fraud 
two of these suits have been dismissed with all appeals exhausted 
five of the remaining suits are pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  the sixth is pending in new york state court  and the seventh is pending in the united states district court for the southern district of california 
the aggregate alleged damages sought in these seven remaining suits is approximately million million of which is sought to be trebled pursuant to rico  plus punitive damages  costs  and fees 
although the outcome of any of these cases is inherently uncertain and may be materially adverse  based on current information  we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

overview we are a leading provider of management and technology consulting services to the us government in the defense  intelligence  and civil markets 
we are further developing the scope and scale of our engineering service capabilities that we provide to our us government clients 
additionally  we provide our management and technology consulting services to major corporations  institutions  and not for profit organizations 
as the needs of our clients have grown more complex  we have expanded beyond our management consulting foundation to develop deep expertise in technology  engineering  and analytics 
our acquisition of the defense systems engineering and support  or dses  division of arinc incorporated  effective november   will further enhance our existing engineering capabilities and defense market position 
subsequent to the acquisition  we changed the name of the acquired company to booz allen hamilton engineering services  or bes 
leveraging our year consulting heritage and a talent base of approximately  people  we deploy our deep domain knowledge  functional expertise  and experience to help our clients achieve their objectives 
today  we serve substantially all of the cabinet level departments of the us government 
our major clients include the department of defense  all branches of the us military  the us intelligence community  and civil agencies such as the department of homeland security  the department of energy  the department of health and human services  the department of the treasury  and the general services administration 
we support these clients in addressing complex and pressing challenges such as combating global terrorism  improving cyber capabilities  transforming the healthcare system  improving efficiency and managing change within the government  and protecting the environment 
in the commercial sector  we serve us clients primarily in the financial services  healthcare  and energy markets  and international clients  primarily in the middle east 
we have a collaborative culture  supported by our operating model  which helps our professionals identify and respond to emerging trends across the markets we serve and deliver enduring results for our clients 
financial and other highlights revenue decreased from fiscal to fiscal we continue to focus on cost reduction efforts and efficiency initiatives which includes effective management of our capacity and efficient management of our costs 
capacity management and other cost reduction activities continued throughout the current period  and may influence future periods  due to the continuing trends of fiscal uncertainty and cost cutting in our principal markets 
these efforts in fiscal have resulted in a net decline in our headcount  which has led to declines in billable hours and therefore a decline in our direct labor 
each of these factors directly results in revenue declines 
in this environment  we have also continued to focus on the effective deployment of our consulting staff to minimize the amount of time our staff spend on non revenue producing activities  which has helped minimize the decline in revenue 
this reduction in unbillable time along with efficient use of our indirect costs  contributes to lower indirect costs  and most importantly a lower ratio of indirect costs to direct labor 
reductions in indirect costs have a direct correlation to a reduction of revenue recognized on our large portfolio of cost reimbursable contracts 
substantially all of our revenue and backlog continues to be derived from services and solutions provided to client organizations across the us government  primarily by our consulting staff and  to a lesser extent  our subcontractors 
the mix of revenue generated by our consulting staff and subcontractors affects our operating margin  as the portion of our operating income derived from fees we earn on services provided by our subcontractors is significantly less than the operating income derived from direct consulting staff labor 
the decline in our revenue described above was partially offset by an increase in revenue of million from our acquisition of dses that closed on november  operating income grew to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which reflects a basis point increase in operating margin to from in the comparable periods 
the improvement in operating margin was due to increased contract profitability due to disciplined cost management of indirect spending  as described above  as well as decreases in compensation related costs primarily due to the net decline in our headcount 
our effective management of other indirect costs and lower ratio of indirect costs to direct labor produces higher margins on our time and material contracts and ultimately produces higher margins on our fixed price contracts 
the factors contributing to the increased operating margin were partially offset by increases in depreciation expense due to facility expansion in previous years  causing a higher increase in depreciation for fiscal  and transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of dses 
in fiscal the company recognized approximately million net of revenue of charges associated with a restructuring plan to reduce certain personal and infrastructure cost  there were no such costs in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recovered additional allowable indirect expenses in conjunction with a reevaluation of its estimate of the recoverability of incentive compensation and other allowable indirect expenses 
this resulted in an increase to revenue and operating income of approximately million 
however  this positive effect to operating income was more than offset by an increase in discretionary incentive compensation expense of approximately million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal cash provided by operations increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in cash provided by operations was a result of overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from clients in a timely manner  and our effective management of vendor payments 
non gaap measures we publicly disclose certain non gaap financial measurements  including adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and adjusted diluted earnings per share  or eps  because management uses these measures for business planning purposes  including to manage our business against internal projected results of operations and measure our performance 
we view adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and adjusted diluted eps as measures of our core operating business  which exclude the impact of the items detailed below  as these items are generally not operational in nature 
these non gaap measures also provide another basis for comparing period to period results by excluding potential differences caused by non operational and unusual or non recurring items 
we also utilize and discuss free cash flow  because management uses this measure for business planning purposes  measuring the cash generating ability of the operating business  and measuring liquidity generally 
we present these supplemental measures because we believe that these measures provide investors with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance  long term earnings potential  or liquidity  as applicable  and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management 
these supplemental performance measurements may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies in our industry 
adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  adjusted diluted eps  and free cash flow are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  and when analyzing our performance or liquidity  as applicable  investors should i evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation of operating and net income to adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income  and net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flows  and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments  each as defined under gaap  ii use adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and adjusted diluted eps in addition to  and not as an alternative to  operating income  net income or diluted eps  as measures of operating results  and iii use free cash flows in addition to  and not as an alternative to  net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity  each as defined under gaap 
we have defined the aforementioned non gaap measures as follows adjusted operating income represents operating income before i certain stock option based and other equity based compensation expenses  ii adjustments related to the amortization of intangible assets  and iii any extraordinary  unusual  or non recurring items 
we prepare adjusted operating income to eliminate the impact of items we do not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual  extraordinary  or non recurring nature or because they result from an event of a similar nature 
adjusted ebitda represents net income before income taxes  net interest and other expense  and depreciation and amortization and before certain other items  including i certain stock option based and other equity based compensation expenses  ii transaction costs  fees  losses  and expenses  including fees associated with debt prepayments  and iii any extraordinary  unusual  or non recurring items 
we prepare adjusted ebitda to eliminate the impact of items we do not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual  extraordinary  or non recurring nature or because they result from an event of a similar nature 
adjusted net income represents net income before i certain stock option based and other equity based compensation expenses  ii transaction costs  fees  losses  and expenses  including fees associated with debt prepayments  iii adjustments related to the amortization of intangible assets  iv amortization or write off of debt issuance costs and write off of original issue discount  and v any extraordinary  unusual  or non recurring items  in each case net of the tax effect calculated using an assumed effective tax rate 
we prepare adjusted net income to eliminate the impact of items  net of tax  we do not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual  extraordinary  or non recurring nature or because they result from an event of a similar nature 
adjusted diluted eps represents diluted eps calculated using adjusted net income as opposed to net income 
additionally  adjusted diluted eps does not contemplate any adjustments to net income as required under the two class method as disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
free cash flow represents the net cash generated from operating activities less the impact of purchases of property and equipment 
below is a reconciliation of adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  adjusted diluted eps  and free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap

factors and trends affecting our results of operations our results of operations have been  and we expect them to continue to be  affected by the following factors  which may cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical results of operations discussed under results of operations 
business environment and key trends in our markets we believe that the following trends and developments in the us government services industry and our markets may influence our future results of operations budget deficits and the growing us national debt increasing pressure on the us government to reduce federal spending across all federal agencies together with associated uncertainty about the size and timing of those reductions  changes in the relative mix of overall us government spending and areas of spending growth  with lower spending on homeland security  intelligence and defense related programs as overseas operations end  and continued increased spending on cyber security  advanced analytics  technology integration and healthcare  cost cutting and efficiency initiatives  budget reductions  congressionally mandated automatic spending cuts  and other efforts to reduce us government spending  which could reduce or delay funding for orders for services especially in the current political environment  continued uncertainty around the timing  extent and nature of congressional and other us government action to address budgeting constraints and the us government ability to incur indebtedness in excess of its current limit and the us deficit  including  the required reductions under the budget control act of as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of  which provides for automatic spending cuts totaling approximately trillion between and delays in the completion of the us government s budget process  which has in the past and could in the future delay procurement of the products  services  and solutions we provide  existing and proposed fiscal constraints by the us government and uncertainty about the size of future budget reductions may cause clients to invest appropriated funds on a less consistent or rapid basis  or not at all  particularly when considering long term initiatives  not issue task orders in sufficient volume to reach current contract ceilings  and delay requests for new proposals and contract awards  relying on short term extensions of current contracts instead  the federal focus on refining the definition of inherently governmental work will continue to drive pockets of insourcing in various agencies  particularly in the intelligence market  cost cutting and efficiency and effectiveness efforts by us civilian agencies with a focus on increased use of performance measurement  program integrity efforts to reduce waste  fraud and abuse in entitlement programs  and renewed focus on improving procurement practices for and interagency use of it services  including through the use of cloud based options and data center consolidation  us government agencies awarding contracts on a technically acceptable lowest cost basis  which could have a negative impact on our ability to win certain contracts  as a result of the us governments efforts to reduce outlays for contractor costs  we may see a continuing shift toward placement of our consulting staff at client site locations instead of our facilities  which generally results in lower billing rates and could have a negative impact on our revenue 
restrictions by the us government on the ability of federal agencies to use lead system integrators  in response to cost  schedule and performance problems with large defense acquisition programs where contractors were performing the lead system integrator role  increasingly complex requirements of the department of defense and the us intelligence community  including cyber security  managing federal health care cost growth and focus on reforming existing government regulation of various sectors of the economy  such as financial regulation and healthcare  increased competition from other government contractors and market entrants seeking to take advantage of the trends identified above  and efforts by the us government to address organizational conflicts of interest and related issues and the impact of those efforts on us and our competitors 
sources of revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from services provided under contracts and task orders with the us government  primarily by our consulting staff and  to a lesser extent  our subcontractors 
funding for our contracts and task orders is generally linked to trends in budgets and spending across various us government agencies and departments 
we provide services under a large portfolio of contracts and contract vehicles to a broad client base  and we believe that our diversified contract and client base lessens potential volatility in our business  however  a reduction in the amount of services that we are contracted to provide to the us government or any of our significant us government clients could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in particular  the department of defense is one of our significant clients  and the budget control act of as amended by the american taxpayer relief act of  which provides for automatic spending cuts totaling approximately trillion between and  requires an estimated billion in federal defense spending cuts over this time period 
a reduction in the amount of services that we are contracted to provide to the department of defense could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  and given the uncertainty of how these automatic reductions may be applied  we are unable to predict the nature or magnitude of the potential adverse effect 
contract types we generate revenue under the following three basic types of contracts cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract  up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded  plus a fee 
we generate revenue under two general types of cost reimbursable contracts cost plus fixed fee and cost plus award fee  both of which reimburse allowable costs and provide for a fee 
the fee under each type of cost reimbursable contract is generally payable upon completion of services in accordance with the terms of the contract 
cost plus fixed fee contracts offer no opportunity for payment beyond the fixed fee 
cost plus award fee contracts also provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based upon the client s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria  such as targets for factors like cost  quality  schedule  and performance 
time and materials contracts 
under a time and materials contract  we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended  and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out of pocket expenses 
to the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
fixed price contracts 
under a fixed price contract  we agree to perform the specified work for a pre determined price 
to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
some fixed price contracts have a performance based component  pursuant to which we can earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance 
fixed price level of effort contracts require us to provide a specified level of effort ie  labor hours  over a stated period of time  for a fixed price 
the amount of risk and potential reward varies under each type of contract 
under cost reimbursable contracts  there is limited financial risk  because we are reimbursed for all allowable costs up to a ceiling 
however  profit margins on this type of contract tend to be lower than on time and materials and fixed price contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for the hours worked using the predetermined hourly rates for each labor category 
in addition  we are typically reimbursed for other contract direct costs and expenses at cost 
we assume financial risk on time and materials contracts because our labor costs may exceed the negotiated billing rates 
profit margins on well managed time and materials contracts tend to be higher than profit margins on cost reimbursable contracts as long as we are able to staff those contracts with people who have an appropriate skill set 
under fixed price contracts  we are required to deliver the objectives under the contract for a pre determined price 
compared to time and materials and cost reimbursable contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities because we receive the full benefit of any cost savings but generally involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of any cost overruns 
in the aggregate  the contract type mix in our revenue for any given period will affect that period profitability 
over time we have experienced a relatively stable contract mix 
however  over the last twelve months we have experienced a shift from time and materials contracts to cost reimbursable contracts 
the table below presents the percentage of total revenue for each type of contract fiscal year ended march  cost reimbursable time and materials fixed price includes both cost plus fixed fee and cost plus award fee contracts 
includes fixed price level of effort contracts 
contract diversity and revenue mix we provide services to our clients through a large number of single award contracts and contract vehicles and multiple award contract vehicles 
most of our revenue is generated under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity  or id iq  contract vehicles  which include multiple award government wide acquisition contract vehicles  or gwacs  and general services administration multiple award schedule contracts  or gsa schedules  and certain single award contracts 
gwacs and gsa schedules are available to all us government agencies 
any number of contractors typically compete under multiple award id iq contract vehicles for task orders to provide particular services  and we earn revenue under these contract vehicles only to the extent that we are successful in the bidding process for task orders 
in fiscal   and  our revenue under gwacs and gsa schedules collectively represented   and of our total revenue  respectively 
no single task order under any contract represented more than of our revenue in fiscal   and no single contract accounted for more than of our revenue in fiscal   and we generate revenue under our contracts and task orders through our provision of services as both a prime contractor and subcontractor  as well as from the provision of services by subcontractors under contracts and task orders for which we act as the prime contractor 
for fiscal   and    and  respectively  of our revenue was generated by contracts and task orders for which we served as a prime contractor    and  respectively  of our revenue was generated by contracts and task orders for which we served as a subcontractor  and   and  respectively  of our revenue was generated by services provided by our subcontractors 
the mix of these types of revenue affects our operating margin 
substantially all of our operating margin is derived from direct consulting staff labor and the portion of our operating margin derived from fees we earn on services provided by our subcontractors is not significant 
we view growth in direct consulting staff labor as the primary measure of earnings growth 
direct consulting staff labor growth is driven by consulting staff headcount growth  after attrition  and total backlog growth 
our people revenue from our contracts is derived from services delivered by consulting staff and  to a lesser extent  from our subcontractors 
our ability to hire  retain  and deploy talent with skills appropriately aligned with client needs is critical to our ability to grow our revenue 
we continuously evaluate whether our talent base is properly sized and appropriately compensated  and contains an optimal mix of skills to be cost competitive and meet the rapidly evolving needs of our clients 
we seek to achieve that result through recruitment and management of capacity and compensation 
as of march    and we employed approximately   and  people  respectively  of which approximately    and  respectively  were consulting staff 
our headcount as of march  is inclusive of the approximately  employees that joined us as a result of the dses acquisition 
contract backlog we define backlog to include the following three components funded backlog 
funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts 
unfunded backlog 
unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
priced options 
priced contract options represent of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
backlog does not include any task orders under id iq contracts  including gwacs and gsa schedules  except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts 
the following table summarizes the value of our contract backlog at the respective dates presented fiscal year ended march  in millions backlog funded unfunded priced options total backlog reflects a reduction by management to the revenue value of orders for services under two existing single award id iq contracts the company has had for several years  based on an established pattern of funding under these contracts by the us government 
our backlog includes orders under contracts that in some cases extend for several years 
the us congress generally appropriates funds for our clients on a yearly basis  even though their contracts with us may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years 
as a result  contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until the us congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract 
we view growth in total backlog and consulting staff headcount as the two key measures of our potential business growth 
growing and deploying consulting staff is the primary means by which we are able to recognize profitable revenue growth 
to the extent that we are able to hire additional consulting staff and deploy them against funded backlog  we generally recognize increased revenue 
total backlog  including backlog from bes of billion  increased by from march  to march  and decreased from march  to march  additions to funded backlog  including funded backlog from bes in fiscal of million  during fiscal and totaled billion and billion  respectively  as a result of the conversion of unfunded backlog to funded backlog  the award of new contracts and task orders under which funding was appropriated  and the exercise and subsequent funding of priced options 
we report internally on our backlog on a monthly basis and review backlog upon occurrence of certain events to determine if any adjustments are necessary 
we cannot predict with any certainty the portion of our backlog that we expect to recognize as revenue in any future period and we cannot guarantee that we will recognize any revenue from our backlog 
the primary risks that could affect our ability to recognize such revenue on a timely basis or at all are program schedule changes  contract modifications  and our ability to assimilate and deploy new consulting staff against funded backlog  cost cutting initiatives and other efforts to reduce us government spending  which could reduce or delay funding for orders for services  and delayed funding of our contracts due to delays in the completion of the us government budgeting process and the use of continuing resolutions by the us government to fund its operations 
funded backlog includes orders under contracts for which the period of performance has expired  and we may not recognize revenue on the funded backlog that includes such orders due to  among other reasons  the tardy submission of invoices by our subcontractors and the expiration of the relevant appropriated funding in accordance with a pre determined expiration date such as the end of the us government fiscal year 
the revenue value of orders included in funded backlog that has not been recognized as revenue due to period of performance expirations has not exceeded approximately of funded backlog as of the end of any of the eight fiscal quarters preceding the fiscal quarter ended march  in our recent experience  none of the following additional risks have had a material negative effect on our ability to realize revenue from our funded backlog the unilateral right of the us government to cancel multi year contracts and related orders or to terminate existing contracts for convenience or default  in the case of unfunded backlog  the potential that funding will not be made available  and  in the case of priced options  the risk that our clients will not exercise their options 
operating costs and expenses costs associated with compensation and related expenses for our people are the most significant component of our operating costs and expenses 
the principal factors that affect our costs are additional people as we grow our business and are awarded new contracts  task orders  and additional work under our existing contracts  and the hiring of people with specific skill sets and security clearances as required by our additional work 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  our board of directors adopted a new equity compensation plan 
the equity compensation component of the new plan has reduced officer related compensation expense included in cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses over the near term with such expense reduction to reverse over time 
our most significant operating costs and expenses are described below 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes direct labor  related employee benefits  and overhead 
overhead consists of indirect costs  including indirect labor relating to infrastructure  management and administration  and other expenses 
billable expenses 
billable expenses include direct subcontractor expenses  travel expenses  and other expenses incurred to perform on contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include indirect labor of executive management and corporate administrative functions  marketing and bid and proposal costs  and other discretionary spending 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of computers  leasehold improvements  furniture and other equipment  and the amortization of internally developed software  as well as third party software that we use internally  and of identifiable long lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
seasonality the us government fiscal year ends on september of each year 
it is not uncommon for us government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds 
in addition  we also have generally experienced higher bid and proposal costs in the months leading up to the us government fiscal year end as we pursue new contract opportunities being awarded shortly after the us government fiscal year end as new opportunities are expected to have funding appropriated in the us government subsequent fiscal year 
we may continue to experience this seasonality in future periods  and our future periods may be affected by it 
seasonality is just one of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  which may affect our results in any period 
see item a 
risk factors 
critical accounting estimates and policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current reasonably available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  including the critical policies and practices listed below  are more fully described and discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because these policies require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of our management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and are the most important to our financial condition and operating results 
revenue recognition and cost estimation substantially all of our revenue is derived from contracts to provide professional services to the us government and its agencies 
in most cases  we recognize revenue as work is performed 
we recognize revenue for cost plus fixed fee contracts with the us government as hours are worked based on reimbursable and allowable costs  recoverable indirect costs and an accrual for the fixed fee component of these contracts 
we recognize as revenue  net of reserves  executive compensation that we determine  based on management estimates  to be allowable  management estimates in this regard are based on a number of factors that may change over time  including executive compensation survey data  our and other government contractors experiences with the dcaa audit practices in our industry and relevant decisions of courts and boards of contract appeals 
many of our us government contracts include award fees  which are earned based on the client s evaluation of our performance 
we have significant history with the client for the majority of contracts on which we earn award fees 
that history and management evaluation and monitoring of performance form the basis for our ability to estimate such fees over the life of the contract 
based on these estimates  we recognize award fees as work on the contracts is performed 
revisions to these estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income  and are reflected in the financial statements in periods in which they are identified 
revenue earned under time and materials contracts is recognized as hours are worked based on contractually billable rates to the client 
costs on time and materials contracts are expensed as incurred 
for fixed price contracts  we recognize revenue on the percentage of completion basis with progress toward completion of a particular contract based on actual costs incurred relative to total estimated costs to be incurred over the life of the contract 
profits on fixed price contracts result from the difference between the incurred costs and the revenue earned 
this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs under the contract can be made 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs are regularly reviewed and recorded revenue and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income  and are reflected in the financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
estimating costs under our long term contracts is complex and involves significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in making estimates include labor productivity and availability  the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed  potential performance delays  warranty obligations  availability and timing of funding from the client  progress toward completion  and recoverability of claims 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses and additional information becomes known  even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change 
any adjustment as a result of a change in estimates is made when facts develop  events become known  or an adjustment is otherwise warranted  such as in the case of a contract modification 
we have procedures and processes in place to monitor the actual progress of a project against estimates and our estimates are updated if circumstances are warranted 
business combinations the company has engaged in business combination activity 
the accounting for business combinations requires management to make judgments and estimates of the fair value of assets acquired  including the identification and valuation of intangible assets  as well as liabilities and contingencies assumed 
such judgments and estimates directly impact the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with each acquisition  as goodwill presents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of its net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
in our recent acquisitions the valuation of the customer relationships required significant judgments related to the cash flows of the contract backlog that are expected to recognized by the company 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
as the consolidated entity represents the only component that constitutes a business whereby discrete financial information is available  we concluded that we have one reporting unit  which is the same as our single operating segment 
we test the trade name for impairment using the royalty relief method 
we perform our annual testing for impairment of goodwill and the trade name as of january of each year 
we performed an annual impairment test of goodwill and the trade name as of january  and on december   we adopted new goodwill impairment guidance whereby we performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of equity 
in making this assessment we considered all relevant events and circumstances 
these include  but are not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  and the reporting unit s overall financial performance 
based on our qualitative assessment at january   we believe that it was not more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than the carrying amount 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we did not record any goodwill impairment or any impairment of our trade name or amortizable intangible assets 
further  we do not consider any of the goodwill  trade name or amortizable intangible assets at risk of impairment 
share based payments we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for stock options 
critical inputs into the black scholes option pricing model include the following option exercise price  fair value of the stock price  expected life of the option  annualized volatility of the stock  annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock  and risk free interest rate 
on february   the company s board of directors authorized and declared a cash dividend in the amount of per share to holders of booz allen holding s class a common stock  class b non voting common stock and class c restricted common stock 
therefore  an annualized dividend yield of approximately was used in the black scholes option pricing model for all grants issued after february  prior to this  the company did not issue recurring dividends and a dividend yield of zero was used in the black scholes option pricing model 
implied volatility is calculated as of each grant date based on our historical volatility along with an assessment of a peer group for future option grants 
other than the expected life of the option  volatility is the most sensitive input to our option grants 
to be consistent with all other implied calculations  the same peer group used to calculate other implied metrics is also used to calculate implied volatility 
while we are not aware of any news or disclosures by our peers that may impact their respective volatility  there is a risk that peer group volatility may increase  potentially increasing any prospective future compensation expense that will result from future option grants 
the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model is determined by referencing the us treasury yield curve rates with the remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures are estimated based on our historical analysis of attrition levels 
forfeiture estimates will be updated quarterly for actual forfeitures 
we do not expect this assumption to change materially  as attrition levels associated with new option grants have not materially changed 
as our class a common stock was not publicly traded until november   we previously obtained contemporaneous valuations by an independent valuation specialist for our fair value determinations 
the valuations were based on several generally accepted valuation techniques a discounted cash flow analysis  a comparable public company analysis  and for the most recent valuation  a comparative transaction analysis 
estimates used in connection with the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the business although there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates 
the valuation analysis resulted in a range of derived values with the final value selected and approved by our compensation committee 
the completion of the initial public offering has added value to the shares due to  among other things  increased liquidity and marketability  however  the extent if any of such additional value cannot be measured with precision or certainty and the shares could suffer a decrease in value 
as a public company  we now use the closing price of our class a common stock on the grant date for valuation purposes 
accounting for income taxes provisions for federal and state income taxes are calculated from the income reported on our financial statements based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those previously used in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for purposes of preparing financial statements than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when  despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable  there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our previously filed income tax returns 
for tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the value of the deferred tax assets is not realizable 
recent accounting pronouncements during the fiscal year ended march   the company adopted the following accounting pronouncement which did not have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which amends topic  comprehensive income 
asu requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
the guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company elected early adoption effective march  refer to note other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb during fiscal and through the filing date did not and are not believed by management to have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
segment reporting we report operating results and financial data in one operating and reportable segment 
we manage our business as a single profit center in order to promote collaboration  provide comprehensive functional service offerings across our entire client base  and provide incentives to employees based on the success of the organization as a whole 
although certain information regarding served markets and functional capabilities is discussed for purposes of promoting an understanding of our complex business  we manage our business and allocate resources at the consolidated level of a single operating segment

results of operations we completed our acquisition of dses on november  the operating results of dses were included in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of closing through march  the following table sets forth items from our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  fiscal versus fiscal fiscal versus fiscal in thousands revenue operating costs and expenses cost of revenue billable expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization restructuring charge total operating costs and expenses operating income interest expense other  net income from operations and before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenue revenue decreased to  million from  million  or a decrease 
the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue attributable to billable expenses and a net decline in our headcount  which has led to declines in billable hours and therefore a decline in our direct labor 
each of these factors directly results in revenue declines 
we also had a lower rate of indirect expenses period over period which has a direct correlation to the reduction of revenue on our large portfolio of cost reimbursable contracts 
the decline in headcount and the lower rate of indirect expenses is primarily attributable to the cost reduction actions the company implemented in late fiscal and continued focus on effective capacity and cost management 
the decrease in revenue was also due to the sale of our state and local transportation business in july  however this was more than offset by an increase in revenue of million from the company acquisition of dses 
conversions to funded backlog during fiscal  totaled billion in comparison to billion for the comparable period  with the decrease due to challenging and uncertain market conditions which is contributing to a lower conversion of unfunded backlog to funded backlog  the reduced award of new contracts and task orders under which funding was appropriated  and the decline in exercise and subsequent funding of priced options 
cost of revenue cost of revenue decreased to  million from  million  or a decrease 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and salary related benefits of million  a decrease of million in incentive compensation costs  and a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense  offset by an increase in other direct consulting staff expenses of million 
the decrease in salaries and salary related benefits and incentive compensation costs was primarily due to reduced headcount in the direct consulting staff senior ranks associated with the cost restructuring plan that was implemented during fiscal the decrease in stock based compensation expense was primarily due to a decrease in expense recognition compared to the prior fiscal year due to the application of the accounting method for recognizing stock based compensation  which requires higher expenses initially and declining expenses in subsequent years 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was and in in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
billable expenses billable expenses decreased to  million from  million  or a decrease 
this decrease was primarily due to decreases in travel and material expenses of million offset by increases in other billable expenses of million incurred to perform on contracts and an increase in subcontractor related expenses of million 
the increase in direct subcontractor expenses was in support of growth on existing and new contracts and task orders during fiscal billable expenses as a percentage of revenue was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million  or a decrease 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in other business related expenses and professional fees attributable to the company disciplined management of corporate related expenditures  a decrease of million in salaries and salary related benefits  and a decrease in stock based compensation of million 
the decrease in salaries and salary related expenses was primarily due to the net reduction in our headcount 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense was primarily due to a decrease in expense recognition compared to the prior fiscal year due to the application of the accounting method for recognizing stock based compensation  which requires higher expenses initially and declining expenses in subsequent years 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by increases of million in incentive compensation costs and million in employer retirement plan contributions 
the increase in incentive compensation costs was due to increased compensation under our annual performance bonus program for senior personnel 
the increase in employer retirement plan contributions was due to the number of employees who completed one year of service and became eligible to participate in our defined contribution plan  the ecap 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased to million from million  or a decrease 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in the amortization of our intangible assets  which includes below market rate leases and contract backlog that were recorded in connection with the acquisition and are amortized based on contractual lease terms and projected future cash flows  respectively  thereby reflecting higher amortization expense initially and declining expense in subsequent periods 
intangible asset amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense interest expense increased to million from million  or a increase 
this increase was primarily due to debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization transaction consummated on july interest is accrued on our  million outstanding debt principal balance as of march  at contractually specified rates ranging from to  and is generally required to be paid to our syndicate of lenders on a monthly or quarterly basis 
income tax expense income tax expense increased to million from million  or a million increase 
the effective tax rate increased to from primarily due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves in the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue revenue increased to  million from  million  or a increase 
the increase in revenue was primarily driven by improved deployment of direct consulting staff against funded backlog and increased other direct costs 
we deployed during fiscal year approximately net additional consulting staff  before taking into consideration the decrease in consulting staff due to the cost restructuring plan at the end of fiscal year the increase in net consulting staff during fiscal was offset by a reduction of personnel as a result of a cost restructuring plan finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that was intended to reduce personnel and infrastructure costs 
we implemented this in response to continued budget constraints and uncertainty in our industry and to provide funds to increase our resources dedicated to growth areas across our markets 
as part of this cost restructuring plan  we reduced overall headcount by approximately 
additions to funded backlog during fiscal totaled billion  as a result of the conversion of unfunded backlog to funded backlog  the award of new contracts and task orders under which funding was appropriated  and the exercise and subsequent funding of priced options 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased to  million from  million  or a increase 
this increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and salary related benefits of million and employer retirement plan contributions of million 
the increase in salaries and salary related benefits was driven by an increase in headcount growth prior to the impact of the cost restructuring plan finalized during the fourth quarter of fiscal and annual base salary increases 
the increase in employer retirement plan contributions was due to an increase in the number of employees who completed one year of service and became eligible to participate in our defined contribution plan  the employees capital accumulation plan  or ecap 
the cost of revenue increase was partially offset by decreases of million in incentive compensation and million in stock based compensation expense 
the decrease in incentive compensation was due to an amendment to the officers compensation plan effective october   such that a portion of incentive compensation is now paid via grants of restricted stock on july of each year  rather than cash  and will vest over a three year period  and management s determination to reduce incentive compensation accrual rates for fiscal year in response to higher than expected business development costs and marketing and bid and proposal activity as well as administrative costs associated with delays in deploying certain direct consulting staff labor 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense was primarily due to a decrease in expense recognition compared to the prior fiscal year due to the application of the accounting method for recognizing stock based compensation  which requires higher expenses initially and declining expenses in subsequent years 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
billable expenses billable expenses increased to  million from  million  or a increase 
this increase was primarily due to increased subcontractor related expenses of million and increased travel and material expenses of million 
the increase in direct subcontractor expenses was in support of growth on existing and new contracts and task orders during fiscal billable expenses as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  or a increase 
this increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and salary related benefits of million associated with an increase in average headcount and an increase of million in other business related expenses and professional fees to support the increased scale of our business 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by decreases of million in incentive compensation  million in stock based compensation expenses and million in employer retirement plan contributions 
the decrease in incentive compensation was due to lower incentive compensation accrual rates for fiscal year  and an amendment to the officers compensation plan that was effective october   such that a portion of incentive compensation is now paid via grants of restricted stock on july of each year  rather than cash  and will vest over a three year period 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense was primarily due to a decrease in expense recognition compared to the same prior year period due to the application of the accounting method for recognizing stock based compensation  which requires higher expenses initially and declining expenses in subsequent years 
the decrease in employer retirement plan contributions was due to the associated decrease in incentive compensation 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased to million from million  or a decrease 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in the amortization of our intangible assets  which includes below market rate leases and contract backlog that were recorded in connection with the acquisition and are amortized based on contractual lease terms and projected future cash flows  respectively  thereby reflecting higher amortization expense initially and declining expense in subsequent periods 
intangible asset amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in amortization expense was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures purchased during fiscal attributable to investments in facility expansion and computer equipment 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million from million  or a decrease 
this decrease was primarily due to the refinancing of our senior secured loan facilities in february to lower interest rates during fiscal interest is accrued on our million outstanding debt principal balance as of march  at contractually specified rates ranging from to  and is generally required to be paid to our syndicate of lenders on a monthly or quarterly basis 
income tax expense income tax expense increased to million from million  or a increase 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in fiscal pre tax income as compared to fiscal partially offset by a lower effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate decreased to from primarily due to the increase in the release of uncertain tax position reserves in fiscal as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations  debt payments  capital expenditures  and discretionary funding needs 
we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents as of march  and  respectively 
however  due to fluctuations in cash flows and the growth in operations  it may be necessary from time to time in the future to borrow under our senior secured loan facilities to meet cash demands 
we anticipate that cash provided by operating activities  existing cash and cash equivalents  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months  which primarily include operating expenses  including salaries  working capital requirements to fund the growth of our business  capital expenditures which primarily relate to the purchase of computers  business systems  furniture and leasehold improvements to support our operations  debt service requirements for borrowings under our senior secured loan facilities  and cash taxes to be paid 
our debt totaled  million and million as of march  and  respectively 
our debt bears interest at specified rates and is held by a syndicate of lenders see note in our consolidated financial statements 
our senior secured loan facilities consist of a million tranche a term facility  or tranche a loans  and a  million tranche b term facility  or tranche b loans 
as of march  we had million and  million principal outstanding under the tranche a term facility and tranche b term facility  respectively 
as of march  we had million and million principal outstanding under the tranche a term facility and tranche b term facility  respectively of our prior credit facility 
we periodically consider opportunities to optimize our capital structure 
in light of the current strength of the credit markets  there is a likelihood that we will engage in a process intended to effectuate a repricing of the outstanding term loan indebtedness under our senior secured facilities  possibly including an extension of the maturities of such indebtedness  and to amend certain terms of such facilities to provide us with more operating flexibility 
while the timing of a potential repricing transaction has not been determined and any decision to ultimately launch or consummate such a transaction will be subject to market conditions and remain within the sole discretion of our board of directors  we currently view it as reasonably likely that we would launch such a transaction sometime during calendar year as an additional consideration  there is a pre payment premium payable if we refinance our outstanding tranche b loans with debt with a lower average yield before august  on november   the company acquired dses for approximately million in cash 
additionally  on december  the company acquired an engineering services company for an immaterial amount 
effective july   the company consummated the recapitalization transaction whereby our debt under the new senior credit facilities total billion million tranche a and  million tranche b and includes a million revolving credit facility 
see indebtedness 
on december   our board of directors approved a million share repurchase program  to be funded from cash on hand 
a special committee of the board of directors was appointed to evaluate market conditions and other relevant factors and initiate repurchases under the program from time to time 
the share repurchase program may be suspended  modified or discontinued at any time at the company s discretion without prior notice 
as of march   no shares have been repurchased under the program 
on may   we declared a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share 
the quarterly dividend is payable on june  to shareholders of record on june  during fiscal  we declared recurring cash dividends totaling million per share 
additionally  during fiscal  we declared special cash dividends totaling  million in may we declared a per share special dividend and in august we declared a per share special dividend 
during fiscal  we declared cash dividends totaling million per share 
no special cash dividends were declared in fiscal for each special dividend declared  the compensation committee  as administrator of the officers rollover stock plan and the equity incentive plan  as amended  is required to make a determination under the respective plan antidilution provision to adjust the outstanding options 
for both the and special dividends  holders of the rollover options received a cash payment equal to the amount of the special dividend on the options mandatory exercise date 
for the special dividend  holders of eip options were granted a dividend equivalent equal to the special dividend payable on june  or the vesting of the eip option  whichever is later 
for the special dividend  holders of eip options with a pre dividend exercise price less than per share received a dividend equivalent equal to the amount of the special dividend payable on august  or the vesting of the eip option  whichever is later 
all other eip options were adjusted by reducing the exercise price by which is equal to the difference between the pre dividend closing fair market value of our class a common stock and the post dividend opening fair market value of our class a common stock as noted on the new york stock exchange 
associated with the payment of the dividends  and in connection with the authorization of the special dividends  the company paid accrued interest on the dpo of million during fiscal no such payments were made for the same periods in fiscal from time to time we evaluate alternative uses for excess cash resources including debt prepayments  payment of recurring and special dividends  share repurchases or funding acquisitions 
any determination to pursue one or more of the above alternative uses for excess cash is subject to the discretion of our board of directors  and will depend upon various factors  including our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity requirements  restrictions that may be imposed by applicable law  our contracts  and our senior secured credit agreement  as amended  and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
cash flows cash received from clients  either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred  is our primary source of cash 
we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the client 
billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors  including whether the contract type is cost reimbursable  time and materials  or fixed price 
we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed 
in contrast  we may be limited to bill certain fixed price contracts only when specified milestones  including deliveries  are achieved 
we experienced a slight shift to fixed price contracts year over year resulting in no material impact to operating cash flow 
in addition  a number of our contracts may provide for performance based payments  which allow us to bill and collect cash prior to completing the work 
accounts receivable is the principal component of our working capital and is generally driven by revenue growth with other short term fluctuations related to the payment practices of our clients 
our accounts receivable reflect amounts billed to our clients as of each balance sheet date 
our clients generally pay our invoices within days of the invoice date 
at any month end  we also include in accounts receivable the revenue that was recognized in the preceding month  which is generally billed early in the following month 
finally  we include in accounts receivable amounts related to revenue accrued in excess of amounts billed  primarily on our fixed price and cost plus award fee contracts 
the total amount of our accounts receivable can vary significantly over time  but is generally sensitive to revenue levels 
total accounts receivable billed and unbilled combined  net of allowance for doubtful accounts days sales outstanding  which we calculate by dividing total accounts receivable by revenue per day during the relevant fiscal quarter  was and as of march  and  respectively 
the table below sets forth our net cash flows for the periods presented fiscal year ended march  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities total increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash from operating activities net cash from operations is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from clients in a timely manner  and our ability to manage our vendor payments 
net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal compared to million in the same prior year period  or a increase 
the increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily the result of overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from clients in a timely manner  and our effective management of vendor payments 
net cash from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in the same prior year period  or a increase 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the million in cash paid to arinc for the acquisition of dses on november  net cash from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in the same prior year period 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the payment of regular and special dividends and associated dividend equivalents  partially offset by the net proceeds of the recapitalization transaction 
indebtedness on july   the company consummated the recapitalization transaction  which included the refinancing and termination of the company existing senior secured credit agreement with the proceeds of the borrowings under the company new senior secured credit agreement 
additionally the net proceeds of the recapitalization were used to pay a special dividend on august   as described above under liquidity and capital resources 
the new senior secured credit agreement  or the credit agreement  provided the company with a million term loan a tranche and a  million term loan b tranche  and a million revolving credit facility with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
in connection with the recapitalization  the company accelerated the amortization of ratable portions of the debt issuance costs  or dic  and original issuance discount  or oid  associated with the prior senior secured term loan facilities and portions of the dic and oid of the credit agreement that do not qualify for deferral of million 
these amounts are reflected in other expense  net in fiscal furthermore  the company expensed third party debt issuance costs of million that did not qualify for deferral  which are reflected in general and administrative costs in fiscal the credit agreement requires quarterly principal payments of of the stated principal amount of tranche a loans  with annual incremental increases to    and  prior to the tranche a loans maturity date of december   and of the stated principal amount of tranche b loans  with the remaining balance payable on the tranche b loans maturity date of july  the revolving credit facility matures on december   at which time any outstanding principal balance is due in full 
the interest rate on borrowings under tranche a is libor plus  and will range from to based on the company total leverage ratio 
the interest rate on borrowings under tranche b is libor plus with a floor 
the revolving credit facility margin and commitment fee are subject to the leveraged based pricing grid  as set forth in the credit agreement 
as of march   we were contingently liable under open standby letters of credit and bank guarantees issued by our banks in favor of third parties that total million 
these letters of credit and bank guarantees primarily relate to leases and support of insurance obligations 
these instruments reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
as of march   we had million of capacity available for additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the loans under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and none of such assets will be available to satisfy the claims of our general creditors 
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants 
the negative covenants are limited to the following  in each case subject to certain exceptions a maximum net total leverage ratio  a minimum net interest coverage ratio  limitations on indebtedness and liens  mergers  consolidations or amalgamations  or liquidations  wind ups or dissolutions  dispositions of property  restricted payments  investments  transactions with affiliates  sale and lease back transactions  change in fiscal periods  negative pledges  restrictive agreements  limitations on line of business  limitations on speculative hedging and limitations on changes of names and jurisdictions 
in addition  we are required to meet certain financial covenants at each quarter end  namely consolidated net total leverage and consolidated net interest coverage ratios 
as of march  we were compliant with these covenants 
prior to the july  recapitalization transaction  our then existing senior secured credit agreement provided for billion in term loans million tranche a loans and million tranche b loans  and a million revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  interest payments of million and million were made for tranche a term loans and tranche b term loans  respectively 
during fiscal  interest payments of million and million were made for tranche a term loans and tranche b term loans  respectively  under our prior facility

the total outstanding debt balance is recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets net of unamortized discount of million and million as of march  and  respectively 
capital structure and resources our stockholders equity amounted to million as of march   a decrease of million compared to stockholders equity of  million as of march   primarily due to the payment of special dividends on june  and august   offset by the net increase in fiscal from common stock issuances  stock option exercises  net income of million  and stock based compensation expense of million 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations that require us to make future cash payments as of march  for contractual obligations  we included payments that we have an unconditional obligation to make 
payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands long term debt a operating lease obligations interest on indebtedness deferred payment obligation b liability to option holders c tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions d other total contractual obligations a see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters 
b includes million deferred payment obligation balance  plus current and future interest accruals 
c reflects liabilities to holders of stock options issued under our officers rollover stock plan and equity incentive plan related to the reduction in the exercise price of such options as a result of special dividends issued in july  december  may and july d includes million of tax liabilities offset by amounts owed under the deferred payment obligation 
the remainder is related to other tax liabilities 
in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors and vendors to provide products and services that we consume in our operations or that are delivered to our clients 
these products and services are not considered unconditional obligations until the products and services are actually delivered  at which time we record a liability for our obligation 
capital expenditures since we do not own any of our facilities  our capital expenditure requirements primarily relate to the purchase of computers  business systems  furniture  and leasehold improvements to support our operations 
direct facility and equipment costs billed to clients are not treated as capital expenses 
our capital expenditures for fiscal and were million and million  respectively  and the majority of such capital expenditures related to facilities infrastructure  equipment  and information technology 
expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across our business 
we also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to a number of reviews  investigations  claims  lawsuits  and other uncertainties related to our business 
for a discussion of these items  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt and cash equivalents  which consist primarily of funds invested in us government insured money market accounts and prime money market funds 
as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
the interest expense associated with our term loans and any loans under our revolving credit facility will vary with market rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt will impact our senior secured loan facilities 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense related to the term facilities under our senior secured loan facilities by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and likewise decreased our income and cash flows 
a hypothetical increase of libor to  the average historical three month libor  would have increased interest expense related to all term facilities under our senior secured loan facilities by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and likewise decreased our income and cash flows 
the year over year variance in interest expense is driven by an increased debt balance and higher interest rate spreads and floors related to the debt facility refinance in july the return on our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march  and was less than 
therefore  although investment interest rates may continue to decrease in the future  the corresponding impact to our interest income  and likewise to our income and cash flow  would not be material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have not entered into any hedging transactions
