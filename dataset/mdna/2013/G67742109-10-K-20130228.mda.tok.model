overview we are an exempted bermuda limited liability company 
our operating companies are us based property and casualty insurance writers  most of which operate in a multi company pool 
pooling arrangements permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool capital and surplus rather than just on its own capital and surplus 
under such arrangements  the members share substantially all insurance business that is written  and allocate the combined premiums  losses and expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our internal pooling arrangement as part of the runoff transaction  as further described below 
the internal pool restructuring did not have an effect on our consolidated results 
we provide a wide range of specialty insurance products and services through independent agencies  regional and national brokers  wholesalers and managing general agencies 
in the year ended december   our net written premiums totaled billion and we had total assets of approximately billion and total onebeacon common shareholders equity of billion at december  our segments our reportable segments are specialty products  specialty industries  and investing  financing and corporate 
the specialty products segment is comprised of seven underwriting operating segments representing an aggregation based on those that offer distinct products and tailored coverages and services to a broad customer base across the united states 
the specialty industries segment is comprised of six underwriting operating segments representing an aggregation based on those that focus on solving the unique needs of a particular customer or industry group

the former other insurance operations segment consisted of substantially all operations classified as discontinued operations as of december   including autoone  other run off business  and certain purchase accounting adjustments relating to the run off business and the onebeacon acquisition 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
significant transactions see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant transactions dispositions below 
historically  we have offered a range of specialty  commercial and personal products and services  however  as a result of recent transactions we are now focused exclusively on specialty business 
in addition  the transactions freed up significant capital  increased our financial flexibility and reduced our catastrophe exposure 
runoff business 
on october   one of onebeacon indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  onebeacon insurance group llc  entered into a definitive agreement the stock purchase agreement with trebuchet us holdings  inc trebuchet  a wholly owned subsidiary of armour group holdings limited together with trebuchet  armour  to sell its run off business

autoone offers products and services to assigned risk markets primarily in new york and new jersey 
autoone has been presented as discontinued operations in the statements of operations with the prior periods reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
pursuant to the terms of the autoone purchase agreement  at closing onebeacon transferred to interboro all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of autoone insurance company aoic and autoone select insurance company aosic  through which substantially all of the autoone business is written on a direct basis 
at closing  onebeacon transferred the assets  liabilities including loss reserves and unearned premiums and capital of the business as well as substantially all of the autoone infrastructure including systems and office space as well as certain staff 
the autoone transaction included the execution of a reinsurance agreement with certain subsidiaries of the company pursuant to which we cede  on a quota share basis  autoone business not directly written by aoic and aosic 
the autoone transaction  which was subject to regulatory approvals  closed in and we recorded post closing adjustments  which resulted in recording an after tax net charge of million relating to underwriting activity and an after tax net gain of million to true up the estimated loss on sale 
during the year ended december   we recorded an after tax net charge of approximately million reflecting the estimated loss on sale of the autoone business 
personal lines 
on july   we completed the sale of our traditional personal lines business the personal lines transaction to tower group  inc tower 
the personal lines transaction included two insurance companies through which the majority of the traditional personal lines business was written on a direct basis  two attorneys in fact managing the reciprocals that wrote the traditional personal lines business in new york and new jersey  the surplus notes issued by the new york and new jersey reciprocals and the remaining renewal rights to certain other traditional personal lines insurance policies 
in addition  the personal lines transaction included the execution of reinsurance agreements with certain subsidiaries of the company pursuant to which we cede  on a quota share basis  traditional personal lines business not directly written by companies included in the sale and assume  on a quota share basis  certain specialty lines business written directly by york insurance company of maine york 
onebeacon and tower also entered into a tsa  pursuant to which we provide certain services to tower during the three year term of the tsa 
tower reimburses us for all of our expenses incurred to provide these services 
reimbursement for these services is netted against the expense incurred 
as consideration  based upon the carrying value of the traditional personal lines business as of july   we received million 
the consideration represented the statutory surplus in the reciprocals as consideration for surplus notes issued by the reciprocals  the combined gaap equity in the insurance companies and attorneys in fact being sold  plus million 
during the year ended december   we recorded a total after tax net gain on the sale of million that is comprised of million included in net other revenues and million included in the tax provision 
during the second quarter of 
table of contents  onebeacon and tower reached agreement on post closing adjustments resulting in no material change to the million after tax net gain on sale that onebeacon had recorded during revenues premiums written are recognized as revenues and are earned ratably over the term of the related policy 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to future insurance coverage provided by policies 
deferred acquisition costs deferred acquisition costs represent commissions  premium taxes  brokerage expenses and other costs that are directly attributable to and vary with the production of business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the applicable premium recognition period 
deferred acquisition costs are limited to the amount expected to be recovered from future earned premiums and anticipated investment income 
this limitation is referred to as a premium deficiency 
a premium deficiency is recognized if the sum of expected loss and lae  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated investment income 
a premium deficiency is recognized by charging any unamortized acquisition costs to expense to the extent required in order to eliminate the deficiency 
on january   we adopted accounting standards update asu  accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts  codified within asc asu is effective for interim periods and annual fiscal years beginning after december  we have elected to adopt asu on a prospective basis 
under the new guidance  deferrable acquisition costs are limited to costs related to successful contract acquisitions 
acquisition costs that are not eligible for deferral are to be charged to expense in the period incurred 
see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
loss and loss adjustment expenses loss and loss adjustment expense lae are charged against income as incurred 
unpaid loss and lae reserves are based on estimates generally determined by claims adjusters  legal counsel  and actuarial staff of the ultimate costs of settling claims  including the effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors 
unpaid loss and lae reserves represent management best estimate of ultimate loss and lae  net of estimated salvage and subrogation recoveries  if applicable 
such estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis and any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in current operations 
the process of estimating loss and lae involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amount of expense to be incurred could be considerably greater than or less than the amounts currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance our insurance subsidiaries enter into ceded reinsurance contracts from time to time to protect their businesses from losses due to concentration of risk and to limit losses arising from catastrophic events 
the majority of such reinsurance contracts are executed through excess of loss treaties and catastrophe contracts under which a third party reinsurer indemnifies our insurance subsidiaries for a specified part or all of certain types of losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event 
we also have entered into quota share treaties with reinsurers under which all risks meeting prescribed criteria are ceded to third party reinsurers on a pro rata basis 
the amount of each risk ceded by us is subject to maximum limits that vary by line of business and type of coverage 
amounts related to reinsurance contracts are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with asc  as applicable 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policies 
our ability to collect our reinsurance recoverables is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers with whom we have entered into reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  principally placing reinsurance with those reinsurers with strong financial condition  reputation  industry ratings and underwriting ability 
management monitors the financial condition and ratings of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
reinsurance premiums  commissions  expense reimbursements and reserves related to reinsured business are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums ceded to other companies are reported as a reduction of premiums written 
expense allowances received in connection with reinsurance ceded have been accounted for as a reduction of the related policy acquisition costs 
share based compensation compensation philosophy our executive compensation policies are designed with one goal in mind  namely  the maximization of shareholder value over long periods of time 
we believe that this goal is best pursued by utilizing a pay for performance program that serves to 
table of contents attract and retain superior executive talent and provide management with performance based incentives to maximize shareholder value 
through this compensation program  we seek to maximize shareholder value by aligning closely the financial interests of management with those of our shareholders 
compensation of our senior management team  including our named executive officers  consists primarily of three components base salary  annual bonus and long term incentive awards 
base salaries have been capped at  annual bonus targets for all senior executives are  with the exception of the chief executive officer at  of base salary 
long term incentives for senior executives have in the past been comprised of performance shares and or performance units 
under these instruments  payouts are explicitly tied to onebeacon performance over a three year period and are highly variable the actual number of shares units paid out at the end of the cycle will range from to of target depending on performance against established goals 
see note employee share based incentive compensation plans of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in recognition that the and performance share cycles  as described below  were projected to payout at or close to zero  creating a significant retention risk over the next years the onebeacon compensation committee of the board the compensation committee in february approved cash retention awards for the executive officers and certain members of senior management 
the compensation committee also approved a pool of money for senior management to make retention awards to certain other key personnel 
share based compensation recognition our share based compensation plans consist of performance shares which are typically settled in cash  stock options which were granted in connection with our initial public offering  restricted stock units and restricted shares 
we account for these share based compensation plans in accordance with asc compensation cost is measured and recognized based on the current market price of the underlying common shares and on the number of shares that are expected to vest

the expense ratio increased points  primarily due to our investment in new businesses and costs associated with actions taken to migrate certain corporate functions to minnesota in the year ended december  reinsurance protection 
we purchase reinsurance in order to minimize loss from large risks or catastrophic events 
we also purchase individual property reinsurance coverage for certain risks to reduce large loss volatility through property per risk excess of loss reinsurance programs and individual risk facultative reinsurance 
we also maintain excess of loss casualty reinsurance programs that provide protection for individual risk or catastrophe losses involving workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  professional liability or umbrella liability 
the availability and cost of reinsurance protection is subject to market conditions  which are outside of our control 
limiting our risk of loss through reinsurance arrangements serves to mitigate the impact of large losses  however  the cost of this protection in an individual period may exceed the benefit 
for the year ended december   our net combined ratio was lower than our gross combined ratio by points  primarily due to the significant amount of reinsurance cessions related to hurricane sandy  which were partially off set by the impact of the cost of facultative reinsurance and property reinsurance  and also the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and marine reinsurance

liquidity and capital resources operating cash and short term investments our sources and uses of cash are as follows holding company level 
the primary sources of cash for onebeacon insurance group  ltd 
and certain of our intermediate holding companies are expected to be distributions and tax sharing payments received from our insurance operating subsidiaries  capital raising activities  net investment income  and proceeds from sales and maturities of holding company investments 
the primary uses of cash are expected to be interest payments on our debt obligations  repurchases and 
table of contents retirements of our debt obligations  dividend payments on our common shares  common share repurchases  purchases of investments  payments made to tax authorities  contributions to our operating subsidiaries  and holding company operating expenses 
operating subsidiary level 
the primary sources of cash for our operating subsidiaries are expected to be premium collections  net investment income  capital raising activities  contributions from our holding companies  and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
the primary uses of cash are expected to be claim payments  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses  interest payments on internal debt obligations  repurchases and retirements of debt obligations  purchases of investments  and distributions and tax sharing payments made to parent holding companies 
insurance companies typically collect premiums on policies that they write prior to paying claims made under those policies 
during periods of premium growth  insurance companies typically experience positive cash flow from operations  as premium receipts typically exceed claim payments 
when this happens  positive cash flow from operations is usually offset by negative cash flow from investing activities  as the positive operating cash flow is used to purchase investments 
conversely  during periods of premium decline  insurance companies typically experience negative cash flow from operations  even during periods in which they report net income  as the claims that they pay exceed the premiums that they collect 
when this happens  negative cash flow from operations is typically offset by positive cash flow from investing activities  as invested assets are sold to fund current claim payments 
for businesses that are in run off  cash flow should be neutral as held investments are used to pay claims  loss adjusting  and other operating expenses 
both internal and external forces influence our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
claim settlements  premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions 
in many cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss 
the exact timing of the payment of claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty 
our operating subsidiaries maintain portfolios of invested assets with varying maturities and a substantial amount of cash and short term investments to provide adequate liquidity for the payment of claims 
management believes that our cash balances  cash flows from operations and cash flows from investments are adequate to meet expected cash requirements for the foreseeable future on both a holding company and operating subsidiary level 
dividend capacity under the insurance laws of the states and jurisdictions under which our operating subsidiaries are domiciled  an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing or the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  there can be no assurance regarding the amount of such dividends that may be paid by such subsidiaries in the future 
generally  our top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiaries have the ability to pay dividends during any month period without the prior approval of regulatory authorities in an amount set by formula based on the greater of prior year statutory net income or of prior year end statutory surplus  subject to the availability of unassigned funds 
onebeacon insurance company obic  our primary top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiary  has the ability to pay million of dividends during without prior approval of regulatory authorities  subject to the availability of unassigned funds 
the amount of dividends available to be paid by obic in any given year is also subject to cash flow and earnings generated by obic business  which now just comprises the runoff business  as well as to dividends received from its subsidiaries  including atlantic specialty insurance company asic 
at december   obic had billion of unassigned funds and billion of statutory surplus 
as disclosed in note acquisitions and dispositions of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of  onebeacon executed various intercompany reinsurance agreements which  along with other internal capital transactions among our insurance operating subsidiaries  resulted in asic becoming the lead insurance company for the ongoing specialty business and obic becoming the lead insurance company for the runoff business 
as a result of the internal restructuring transactions  obic statutory net income was significantly higher than that of our consolidated combined statutory net income as statutory net losses at lower tiered subsidiaries more than offset the income recorded at obic 
notwithstanding these restructuring transactions  onebeacon continues to manage its statutory capital on a combined basis 
although obic remains a top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiary and maintains sufficient statutory capital to support the runoff business  the majority of the group statutory capital is now included in asic to support the ongoing specialty business 
asic has the ability to pay dividends during any month period without the prior approval of regulatory authorities in an amount set by formula based on the lesser of net investment income  as defined by statute  or of statutory surplus  in both cases as most recently reported to regulatory authorities  subject to the availability of earned surplus 
given the changes in 
table of contents structure noted above  asic will likely require prior approval by regulatory authorities in order to pay dividends until it builds up a historical net investment income stream and earned surplus balance under its new structure 
at december   asic had negative earned surplus and billion of statutory surplus 
during  our top tier regulated insurance operating subsidiaries distributed million to their immediate parent  representing million of dividends  which included the distribution of a regulated insurance subsidiary with a value of million  and a return of capital to onebeacon llc of million 
during  our unregulated insurance operating subsidiaries paid million of dividends to their immediate parent 
at december   onebeacon unregulated insurance operating subsidiaries had million of net unrestricted cash  short term investments and fixed maturity investments 
during  onebeacon ltd

insurance float insurance float is an important aspect of our insurance operations 
insurance float represents funds that an insurance company holds for a limited time 
in an insurance operation  float arises because premiums are collected before losses are paid 
this interval can extend over many years 
during that time  the insurer invests the funds 
when the premiums that an insurer collects do not cover the losses and expenses it eventually must pay  the result is an underwriting loss  which is considered to be the cost of insurance float 
we calculate our insurance float by taking our net invested assets and subtracting our total capital 
although insurance float can be calculated using numbers determined under gaap  insurance float is not a gaap concept and  therefore  there is no comparable gaap measure 
insurance float can increase in a number of ways  including through acquisitions of insurance operations  organic growth in existing insurance operations and recognition of losses that do not cause a corresponding reduction in investment assets 
conversely  insurance float can decrease in a number of other ways  including sales of insurance operations  shrinking or run off of existing insurance operations  the acquisition of operations that do not have substantial investment assets eg  an agency and the recognition of gains that do not cause a corresponding increase in investment assets 
we have historically obtained our insurance float through both acquisitions and organic growth 
we intend to generate low cost float over time through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth in our ongoing insurance operations 
however  we will seek to increase our insurance float organically only when market conditions allow for an expectation of generating underwriting profits 
certain operational leverage metrics can be measured with ratios that are calculated using insurance float 
there are many activities that do not change the amount of insurance float at an insurance company but can have a significant impact on the company operational leverage metrics 
for example  investment gains and losses  foreign currency gains and losses  debt issuances and repurchases repayments  common share issuances and repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders are all activities that do not change insurance float but that can meaningfully impact operational leverage metrics

critical accounting estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements presented herein include all adjustments considered necessary by management to fairly present our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the historical consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to fair value measurements  loss and lae reserves  and reinsurance transactions 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that certain of these estimates are considered critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability 
the descriptions below summarize the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our historical consolidated financial statements 
fair value considerations we measure certain assets at estimated fair value in our consolidated financial statements  with changes therein recognized in current period earnings 
in addition  we disclose estimated fair value for certain assets and liabilities measured at historical or amortized cost 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants an exit price 
fair value measurements are categorized into a hierarchy that distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources observable inputs and a reporting entity internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable unobservable inputs 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities have the highest priority level  followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices  including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities level and unobservable inputs  including the reporting entity estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use  having the lowest priority level 
assets carried at fair value include fixed maturity investments  common equity securities  convertible fixed maturity investments and interests in hedge funds and private equity funds 
valuation of assets measured at fair value require us to make estimates and apply judgment to matters that may carry a significant degree of uncertainty 
in determining our estimates of fair value  we use a variety of valuation approaches and inputs 
whenever possible  we estimate fair value using valuation methods that maximize the use of observable prices and other inputs 
for investments in active markets  we use quoted market prices to determine fair value 
in circumstances where quoted market prices are unavailable  we utilize fair value estimates based upon reference to other observable inputs other than quoted prices  including matrix pricing  benchmark interest rates  market comparables  broker quotes and other relevant observable inputs 
where observable inputs are not available  the estimated fair value is based upon internal pricing models using assumptions that include inputs that may not be observable in the marketplace but which reflect our best judgment given the circumstances and consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments 

table of contents as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
investments valued using level inputs include fixed maturity investments  primarily investments in us treasuries  common equities and short term investments  which include us treasury bills 
investments valued using level inputs comprise fixed maturity investments including corporate debt  state and other governmental debt  convertible fixed maturity investments and mortgage and asset backed securities 
fair value estimates for investments that trade infrequently and have few or no observable market prices are classified as level measurements 
level fair value estimates based upon unobservable inputs include our investments in hedge funds and private equity funds  as well as certain investments in debt and equity securities  including asset backed securities  where quoted market prices are unavailable 
we use brokers and outside pricing services to assist in determining fair values 
the outside pricing services we use have indicated that they will only provide prices where observable inputs are available 
if no observable inputs are available for a security  the pricing services will not provide a price 
in those circumstances  we estimate the fair value using industry standard pricing models and observable inputs such as benchmark interest rates  matrix pricing  market comparables  broker quotes  issuer spreads  bids  offers  credit rating prepayment speeds and other relevant inputs 
our process to assess the reasonableness of the market prices obtained from the outside pricing sources covers substantially all of our fixed maturity investments and includes  but is not limited to  evaluation of model pricing methodologies  review of the pricing services quality control processes and procedures on at least an annual basis  comparison of market prices to prices obtained from different independent pricing vendors on at least an annual basis  monthly analytical reviews of certain prices and review of assumptions utilized by the pricing service for selected measurements on an ad hoc basis throughout the year 
we also perform back testing of selected purchases and sales activity to determine whether there are any significant differences between the market price used to value the security prior to purchase or sale and the actual purchase or sale price on at least an annual basis 
prices provided by the pricing services that vary by more than and million from the expected price based on the procedures are considered outliers 
in circumstances where the results of our review process does not appear to support the market price provided by the pricing services  we challenge the price 
if we cannot gain satisfactory evidence to support the challenged price  we rely upon our own pricing methodologies to estimate the fair value of the security in question 
other investments  which are primarily comprised of hedge funds and private equity funds for which the fair value option has been elected  are carried at fair value based upon our proportionate interest in the underlying fund net asset value  which is deemed to approximate fair value 
the fair value of our investments in hedge funds and private equity funds has been estimated using net asset value because it reflects the fair value of the funds underlying investments 
we employ a number of procedures to assess the reasonableness of the fair value measurements  including obtaining and reviewing each fund audited financial statements and discussing each fund pricing with the fund manager 
the fair values of our investments in hedge funds and private equity funds have been classified as level under the fair value hierarchy since the fund managers do not provide sufficient information to independently evaluate the pricing inputs and methods for each underlying investment  and therefore the inputs are considered to be unobservable 
in circumstances where the underlying investments are publicly traded  such as the investments made by hedge funds  the fair value of the underlying investments is determined using current market prices 
in circumstances where the underlying investments are not publicly traded  such as the investments made by private equity funds  the private equity fund managers have considered the need for a liquidity discount on each of the underlying investments when determining the fund net asset value 
in circumstances where our portion of a fund net asset value is deemed to differ from fair value due to illiquidity or other factors associated with our investment in the fund  including counterparty credit risk  the net asset value is adjusted accordingly 
at december  and  we did not record a liquidity adjustment to the net asset value related to our investments in hedge funds or private equity funds

loss and lae reserves other than asbestos and environmental reserves we establish loss and lae reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred 
the process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
loss and lae reserves are typically comprised of case reserves for claims reported and reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported  referred to as ibnr reserves  which include a provision for expected future development on case reserves 
case reserves are estimated based on the experience and knowledge of claims staff regarding the nature and potential cost of each claim and are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ibnr reserves are derived by subtracting paid loss and lae and case reserves from estimates of ultimate loss and lae 
actuaries estimate ultimate loss and lae using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information 
like case reserves  ibnr reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ultimate loss and lae are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
in forecasting ultimate loss and lae with respect to any line of business  past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource  but cannot be relied upon in isolation 
our own experience  particularly claims development experience  such as trends in case reserves  payments on and closings of claims  as well as changes in business mix and coverage limits  is the most important information for estimating our reserves 
external data  available from organizations such as statistical bureaus  consulting firms and reinsurance companies  is sometimes used to supplement or corroborate our own experience  and can be especially useful for estimating costs of new business 
for some lines of business  such as long tail coverages discussed below  claims data reported in the most recent accident year is often too limited to provide a meaningful basis for analysis due to the typical delay in reporting of claims 
for this type of business  we use a selected loss ratio method for the initial accident year or years 
this is a standard and accepted 
table of contents actuarial reserve estimation method in these circumstances in which the loss ratio is selected based upon information used in pricing policies for that line of business  as well as any publicly available industry data  such as industry pricing  experience and trends  for that line of business 
uncertainties in estimating ultimate loss and lae are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short usually a few days up to a few months 
the claim tail for liability casualty coverages  such as automobile liability  general liability  products liability  multiple peril coverage  and workers compensation  can be especially long as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years  even decades  after the related loss events occur 
during the long claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends may become known and  as a result  we may adjust our reserves 
if management determines that an adjustment is appropriate  the adjustment is booked in the accounting period in which such determination is made 
accordingly  should reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted  respectively 
in determining ultimate loss and lae  the cost to indemnify claimants  provide needed legal defense and other services for insureds and administer the investigation and adjustment of claims are considered 
these claim costs are influenced by many factors that change over time  such as expanded coverage definitions as a result of new court decisions  inflation in costs to repair or replace damaged property  inflation in the cost of medical services and legislated changes in statutory benefits  as well as by the particular  unique facts that pertain to each claim 
as a result  the rate at which claims arose in the past and the costs to settle them may not always be representative of what will occur in the future 
the factors influencing changes in claim costs are often difficult to isolate or quantify and developments in paid and incurred losses from historical trends are frequently subject to multiple and conflicting interpretations 
changes in coverage terms or claims handling practices may also cause future experience and or development patterns to vary from the past 
a key objective of actuaries in developing estimates of ultimate loss and lae  and resulting ibnr reserves  is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them so that the future can be projected reliably 
because of the factors previously discussed  this process requires the use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain 
our actuaries use several generally accepted actuarial methods to evaluate our loss and lae reserves  each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses 
we place more or less reliance on a particular method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the reserve estimates are made 
these methods generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories historical paid loss development methods these methods use historical loss payments over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical paid loss development methods assume that the ratio of losses paid in one period to losses paid in an earlier period will remain constant 
these methods necessarily assume that factors that have affected paid losses in the past  such as inflation or the effects of litigation  will remain constant in the future 
because historical paid loss development methods do not use case reserves to estimate ultimate losses  they can be more reliable than the other methods discussed below that look to case reserves such as actuarial methods that use incurred losses in situations where there are significant changes in how case reserves are established by a company claims adjusters 
however  historical paid loss development methods are more leveraged  meaning that small changes in payments have a larger impact on estimates of ultimate losses  than actuarial methods that use incurred losses because cumulative loss payments take much longer to equal the expected ultimate losses than cumulative incurred amounts 
in addition  and for similar reasons  historical paid loss development methods are often slow to react to situations when new or different factors arise than those that have affected paid losses in the past 
historical incurred loss development methods these methods  like historical paid loss development methods  assume that the ratio of losses in one period to losses in an earlier period will remain constant in the future 
however  instead of using paid losses  these methods use incurred losses ie  the sum of cumulative historical loss payments plus outstanding case reserves over discrete periods of time to estimate future losses 
historical incurred loss development methods can be preferable to historical paid loss development methods because they explicitly take into account open cases and the claims adjusters evaluations of the cost to settle all known claims 
however  historical incurred loss development methods necessarily assume that case reserving practices are consistently applied over time 
therefore  when there have been significant changes in how case reserves are established  using incurred loss data to project ultimate losses can be less reliable than other methods 
expected loss ratio methods these methods are based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
expected loss ratios are typically developed based upon the information used in pricing  and are multiplied by the total amount of premiums written to calculate ultimate losses 
expected 
table of contents loss ratio methods are useful for estimating ultimate losses in the early years of long tailed lines of business  when little or no paid or incurred loss information is available 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods these methods take traditional historical paid and incurred loss development methods and adjust them for the estimated impact of changes from the past in factors such as inflation  the speed of claim payments or the adequacy of case reserves 
adjusted historical paid and incurred loss development methods are often more reliable methods of predicting ultimate losses in periods of significant change  provided the actuaries can develop methods to reasonably quantify the impact of changes 
we perform an actuarial review of our recorded reserves each quarter 
our actuaries compare the previous quarter estimates of paid loss and lae  case reserves and ibnr to amounts indicated by actual experience 
differences between previous estimates and actual experience are evaluated to determine whether a given actuarial method for estimating loss and lae should be relied upon to a greater or lesser extent than it had been in the past 
while some variance is expected each quarter due to the inherent uncertainty in loss and lae  persistent or large variances would indicate that prior assumptions and or reliance on certain reserving methods may need to be revised going forward 
upon completion of each quarterly review  our actuaries select indicated reserve levels based on the results of the actuarial methods described previously  which are the primary consideration in determining management best estimate of required reserves 
however  in making its best estimate  management also considers other qualitative factors that may lead to a difference between held reserves and actuarially recommended levels in the future 
typically  these factors exist when management and our actuaries conclude that there is insufficient historical incurred and paid loss information or that trends included in the historical incurred and paid loss information are unlikely to repeat in the future 
such factors include  among others  recent entry into new markets or new products  improvements in the claims department that are expected to lessen future ultimate loss costs and legal and regulatory developments 
at december  and  total carried reserves  including reserves that are presented as liabilities held for sale in the december  balance sheet related to the runoff business  were and  respectively  above the actuarial point estimate 
asbestos and environmental a e reserves our reserves include provisions made for claims that assert damages from a e related exposures 
asbestos claims relate primarily to injuries asserted by those who allegedly came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up cost obligations  particularly as mandated by federal and state environmental protection agencies 
in addition to the factors described above under reserves other than asbestos and environmental reserves regarding the reserving process  we estimate our a e reserves based upon  among other factors  facts surrounding reported cases and exposures to claims  such as policy limits and deductibles  current law  past and projected claim activity and past settlement values for similar claims  as well as analysis of industry studies and events  such as recent settlements and asbestos related bankruptcies 
the cost of administering a e claims  which is an important factor in estimating loss and lae reserves  tends to be higher than in the case of non a e claims due to the higher legal costs typically associated with a e claims 
a large portion of our a e losses resulted from the operations of the employers group  an entity acquired by one of the legacy companies in these operations  including business of employers surplus lines insurance company and employers liability assurance corporation  provided primary and excess liability insurance for commercial insureds  including fortune sized accounts  some of whom subsequently experienced claims for a e losses 
we stopped writing such coverage in our liabilities for a e losses from business underwritten in the recent past are substantially limited by the application of exclusionary clauses in the policy language that eliminated coverage for such claims 
after for pollution and for asbestos  most liability policies contained industry standard absolute exclusions of such claims 
in earlier years  various exclusions were also applied  but the wording of those exclusions was less strict and subsequent court rulings have reduced their effectiveness 
we also incurred a e losses via our participation in industry pools and associations 
the most significant of these pools was excess casualty reinsurance association  or ecra  which provided excess liability reinsurance to us insurers from until the early s 
ecra incurred significant liabilities for a e  of which we bear approximately a and share  respectively  at december  and  or million and million  respectively  at december  and  which is fully reflected in our loss and lae reserves 
more recently  since the s  we have experienced an influx of claims from commercial insureds  including many non fortune sized accounts written during the s and s  who are named as defendants in asbestos lawsuits 
as a number of large well known manufacturers of asbestos and asbestos containing products have gone into bankruptcy  plaintiffs 
table of contents have sought recoveries from peripheral defendants  such as installers  transporters or sellers of such products  or from owners of premises on which the plaintiffs exposure to asbestos allegedly occurred 
at december   policyholders had asbestos related claims against us 
in  new insureds with such peripheral involvement presented asbestos claims under prior policies we had written 
historically  most asbestos claims have been asserted as product liability claims 
recently  insureds who have exhausted the available products liability limits of their insurance policies have sought from insurers such as us payment for asbestos claims under the premises and operations coverage of their liability policies  which may not be subject to similar aggregate limits 
we expect this trend to continue 
however  to date there have been fewer of these premises and operations coverage claims than product liability coverage claims 
this may be due to a variety of factors  including that it may be more difficult for underlying plaintiffs to establish losses as stemming from premises and operations exposures  which requires proof of the defendant negligence  rather than products liability under which strict legal liability applies 
premises and operations claims may vary significantly and policyholders may seek large amounts  although such claims frequently settle for a fraction of the initial alleged amount 
accordingly  there is a great deal of variation in damages awarded for the actual injuries 
as of december   there were approximately active claims by insureds against us without product liability coverage asserting operations or premises coverage  which may not be subject to aggregate limits under the policies 
immediately preceding the onebeacon acquisition  we purchased a reinsurance contract with nico under which we are entitled to recover from nico up to billion in the future for asbestos claims arising from business written by us in and prior  environmental claims arising from business written by us in and prior  and certain other exposures 
under the terms of the nico cover  nico receives the economic benefit of reinsurance recoverables from certain of our third party reinsurers in existence at the time the nico cover was executed  or third party recoverables 
as a result  the third party recoverables serve to protect the billion limit of nico coverage for the benefit of us 
any amounts uncollectible from third party reinsurers due to dispute or the reinsurers financial inability to pay are covered by nico under its agreement with us 
third party recoverables are typically for the amount of loss in excess of a stated level each year 
of claim payments from through  approximately of a e losses have been recovered under the historical third party reinsurance 
during  we completed a study of our legacy a e exposures 
reasonable estimates of potential adverse scenarios continue to be within the billion reinsurance cover issued by nico 
based on the results of the study  we increased the point estimate of incurred losses ceded to nico from billion to billion  an increase of million  net of underlying reinsurance 
due to the nico cover  there was no impact to income or equity from the change in the estimate 
as part of our previously described actuarial review process  we review a e activity each quarter and compare that activity to what was assumed in the most recently completed study 
as of december   we noted no change in the range of reasonable outcomes around our best estimate described above 
as noted above  we have ceded estimated incurred losses of approximately billion to the nico cover at december  since entering into the nico cover  approximately of the billion of utilized coverage relates to uncollectible third party recoverables and settlements on third party recoverables through december  net losses paid totaled billion as of december  to the extent that actual experience differs from our estimate of incurred a e losses and third party recoverables  future losses could exceed the million of protection remaining under the nico cover 
our reserves for a e losses  net of third party recoverables but prior to nico recoveries  were billion at december  an industry benchmark of reserve adequacy is the survival ratio  computed as a company reserves divided by its historical average yearly loss payments 
this ratio indicates approximately how many more years of payments the reserves can support  assuming future yearly payments are equal to historical levels 
our survival ratio was at december  this was computed as the ratio of a e reserves  net of third party recoverables prior to the nico cover of billion plus the remaining unused portion of the nico cover of million  to the average a e loss payments over the three year period ended december   net of third party recoverables 
our survival ratio was years at december  we believe that as a result of the nico cover and our historical third party reinsurance programs  we should not experience material financial loss from a e exposures under current coverage interpretations and that our survival ratio compares favorably to industry survival ratios 
however  the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid using recent annual average payments subject to adjustments for unusual items 
many factors  such as aggressive settlement procedures  mix of business and coverage provided  have a significant effect on the amount of a e reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio 
thus  caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio 
our reserves for a e losses at december  represent management best estimate of its ultimate liability based on information currently available 
however  significant uncertainties  including but not limited to case law developments  
table of contents medical and clean up cost increases and industry settlement practices  limit our ability to accurately estimate ultimate liability and we may be subject to a e losses beyond currently estimated amounts 
in addition  we remain liable for risks reinsured in the event that a reinsurer does not honor its obligations under reinsurance contracts 
see note reserves for unpaid loss and lae asbestos and environmental loss and lae reserve activity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our a e reserves 
a e claims activity our a e claims activity  substantially all of which relates to runoff business  the operations of which have been included in discontinued operations and the loss and lae reserves of which are included in liabilities held for sale on the december  consolidated balance sheet  is illustrated in the table below year ended december  asbestos accounts with asbestos claims at the beginning of the year accounts reporting asbestos claims during the year accounts on which asbestos claims were closed during the year accounts with asbestos claims at the end of the year environmental accounts with environmental claims at the beginning of the year accounts reporting environmental claims during the year accounts on which environmental claims were closed during the year accounts with environmental claims at the end of the year total total accounts with a e claims at the beginning of the year accounts reporting a e claims during the year accounts on which a e claims were closed during the year total accounts with a e claims at the end of the year reserve estimation by line of business the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must consider many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
we  like other insurance companies  categorize and track our insurance reserves by line of business  such as automobile liability  multiple peril liability and workers compensation 
furthermore  we regularly review the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business level  considering the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of business 
for loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves  excluding a e  the key assumption as of december  was that the impact of the various reserving factors  as described below  on future paid losses would be similar to the impact of those factors on the historical loss data with the exception of severity trends 
severity trends have been relatively stable over the relevant historical period 
the actuarial methods use would project losses assuming continued stability in severity trends 
management has considered future increases in loss severity trends including the impact of inflation in making its reserve selections 
the major causes of material uncertainty reserving factors generally will vary for each product line  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line 
the following section details reserving factors by product line 
there could be other reserving factors that may impact ultimate claim costs 
each reserving factor presented will have a different impact on estimated reserves 
also  reserving factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on estimated reserves 
for example  in workers compensation  the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster  thereby lowering indemnity costs 
thus  in almost all cases  it is impossible to discretely measure the 
table of contents effect of a single reserving factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
workers compensation workers compensation covers an employer liability for injuries  disability or death of employees  without regard to fault  as prescribed by state workers compensation law and other statutes 
workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year 
while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly  some other payments are made over the course of several years  such as awards for permanent partial injuries 
in addition  some payments can run as long as the injured worker life  such as permanent disability benefits and ongoing medical care 
despite the possibility of long payment tails  the reporting lags are generally short  settlements are generally not complex  and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity 
the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency  high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker injury 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated workers compensation reserves include general workers compensation reserving factors mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment or dependents entitled to survivor benefits degree of cost shifting between workers compensation and health insurance changes in claim handling philosophies eg  case reserving standards indemnity reserving factors time required to recover from the injury degree of available transitional jobs degree of legal involvement changes in the interpretations and processes of various workers compensation bureaus oversight of claims future wage inflation for states that index benefits changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds re marriage rate for spouse in instances of death medical reserving factors changes in the cost of medical treatments  including prescription drugs  and underlying fee schedules frequency of visits to health providers number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers types of health providers used type of medical treatments received use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices availability of new medical processes and equipment changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs degree of patient responsiveness to treatment workers compensation book of business reserving factors product mix injury type mix changes in underwriting standards multiple peril multiple peril represents a package policy sold to insureds or to members of trade associations or other groups that include general liability and property insurance 
general liability covers businesses for any liability resulting from bodily injury and property damage arising from general business operations  accidents on a premises and the products manufactured or sold 
property covers losses to a business premises  inventory and equipment as a result of weather  fire  theft and other causes 
because commercial multiple peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses  it includes both short and long tail coverages 
for property coverage  it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims  while for the other coverages  generally for the liability coverages  it takes a longer period of time to close claims 
the 
table of contents reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product  except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses 
multiple peril liability reserves here are generally analyzed as two components bodily injury and property damage 
bodily injury payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder legal obligation arising from non intentional acts such as negligence  subject to the insurance policy provisions 
in some cases the damages can include future wage loss which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation and future medical treatment costs 
property damage payments result from damages to the claimant private property arising from the policyholder legal obligation for non intentional acts 
in most cases  property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date  or soon thereafter 
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant  sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims  though for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim 
multiple peril liability is generally considered a long tail line  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided and the jurisdiction  among other factors 
there are numerous components underlying the multiple peril liability product line 
some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within to years  while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims eg  a reporting lag of a decade for construction defect claims 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated multiple peril liability reserves include multiple peril liability reserving factors changes in claim handling philosophies eg  case reserving standards changes in policy provisions or court interpretations of such provisions new theories of liability trends in jury awards changes in the propensity to sue  in general with specificity to particular issues changes in statutes of limitations changes in the underlying court system distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues changes in tort law shifts in lawsuit mix between federal and state courts changes in settlement patterns multiple peril liability book of business reserving factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  or endorsements changes in underwriting standards product mix eg  size of account  industries insured  or jurisdiction mix commercial automobile liability the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to automobile physical damage property claims and property damage liability claims 
the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims 
commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in two components  liability and collision comprehensive claims 
this second component has minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and  accordingly  separate reserving factors are not presented 
the liability component includes claims for both bodily injury and property damage 
in general  claim reporting lags are minor  claim complexity is not a major issue  and the line is viewed as high frequency  low to moderate severity 
examples of common reserving factors that can change and  thus  affect the estimated commercial automobile liability reserves include bodily injury and property damage liability reserving factors trends in jury awards changes in the underlying court system changes in case law litigation trends frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits 
table of contents change in average severity of accidents  or proportion of severe accidents subrogation opportunities changes in claim handling philosophies eg  case reserving standards frequency of visits to health providers number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers types of health providers used types of medical treatments received changes in cost of medical treatments degree of patient responsiveness to treatment commercial automobile liability book of business reserving factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  or endorsements changes in mix of insured vehicles eg  long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles  or fleet risks versus non fleet risks changes in underwriting standards general liability see the above discussions under the liability product lines with regard to reserving factors for multiple peril  which are similar to the reserving factors used for general liability 
prior loss and lae development discussions by year ongoing business the prior loss and lae development discussion by year below relate to ongoing business ongoing business that is included in the specialty products and specialty industries segments 
loss and lae development during the year ended december   onebeacon experienced million of favorable loss and lae reserve development on prior accident year reserves 
during  management began separately reviewing loss reserves for some business which had been previously managed as a part of onebeacon former commercial lines underwriting unit 
as of december   the reserves for these businesses had been selected based on expected emergence which was based in large part on the historic loss development of the former commercial lines underwriting unit 
the favorable reserve development was primarily due to emergence which continued to be lower than expected for these businesses  particularly in the workers compensation  multiple peril liability and general liability lines 
this favorable development was offset somewhat by adverse development on a few excess property claims 
loss and lae development during the year ended december   onebeacon experienced million of favorable loss and lae reserve development on prior accident year loss reserves 
the favorable loss reserve development was primarily due to lower than expected severity on non catastrophe losses related to professional liability lines  multiple peril liability lines and other general liability lines 
with respect to the favorable loss reserve development  at december   management had revised its expectations downward for future loss emergence in the professional liability business  which had initially been based on market analysis when this business was initiated in and however  during the year ended december   losses continued to be lower than these revised expectations 
as a result  management lowered its selected reserves on the earliest years which affected more recent years as total loss expectations for those years are based in part on prior years results 
the impact of this revised estimate was a decrease to professional liability reserves of million 
during  management began separately reviewing loss reserves for some business which had been previously managed as a part of onebeacon former commercial lines underwriting unit 
as of december   the reserves for these businesses had been selected based on expected emergence which was based on the historic loss development of the former commercial lines underwriting unit 
however  during the actual emerged experience for these businesses was significantly lower than the expected emergence 
as a result of this favorable emergence  management lowered the loss reserves for these businesses by million  which also affect the specialty industries and specialty products segments 
in addition to the development described for the lines of business above  management also recorded a million net decrease in reserves in other lines of business as a result of its review of loss reserves at december  the change in reserves for each other line of business was not individually significant 

table of contents loss and lae development during the year ended december   onebeacon experienced million of favorable loss and lae reserve development on prior accident year loss reserves 
the favorable loss reserve development was primarily due to lower than expected severity on non catastrophe losses related to professional liability lines  multiple peril liability lines and other general liability lines  as well as development on personal lines business 
the favorable development also included a million release of commercial catastrophe reserves associated with storms occurring in and specifically  at december   management had revised its expectations downward with respect to future loss emergence in the professional liability business  which had initially been based on market analysis when this business was initiated in and however  during the year ended december   losses continued to be significantly lower than these revised expectations 
as a result  management lowered its selected reserves on the earliest years which affected more recent years as total loss expectations for those years are based in part on prior years results 
the impact of this revised estimate was a decrease to professional liability reserves of million 
at december   management had recorded million of reserves for certain claims related to catastrophes from accident years and related to excess property business 
during the year ended december   these claims were resolved for amounts below onebeacon policy coverage therefore the reserves were no longer necessary 
in addition to the development described for the lines of business above  management also recorded a million net decrease in ibnr in other lines of business  primarily personal lines  as a result of its review of loss reserves at december  the change in reserves for each other line of business was not individually significant 
prior loss and lae development discussions by year runoff business loss and lae development during the year ended december   onebeacon experienced million of net unfavorable loss reserve development related to discontinued operations primarily driven by case incurred development on a small number of claims related to multiple peril liability lines and general liability lines and also the impact of an adverse court ruling in mississippi regarding a disputed assessment from an involuntary pool for hurricane katrina claims 
in addition  there was a change in the workers compensation tabular discount rate from to that resulted in net unfavorable loss reserve development of million 
loss and lae development during the year ended december   onebeacon experienced million of net unfavorable loss reserve development from the runoff business 
the net unfavorable loss reserve development resulted from a detailed review of runoff expenses  principally unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae  completed during the fourth quarter of specifically  onebeacon completed a detailed review of loss and defense and cost containment expenses allocated lae  or alae and other adjusting expenses ulae during the fourth quarter of the analysis considered costs  based on current non staff expenses and staffing projections for the runoff business  as onebeacon continued efforts to segregate its claims operations between ongoing claims and runoff claims 
the analysis also factored in the revised definition of runoff claims to include the non specialty commercial lines business that was exited via the renewal rights agreement sale beginning with january  effective dates 
loss and lae development during the year ended december   onebeacon experienced million of net favorable loss reserve development from the runoff business 
the net favorable loss reserve development was primarily due to lower than expected severity on multiple peril liability lines and other general liability lines  particularly for accident years through as a result of the lower than expected case incurred loss and alae  actuarial methods based on case incurred losses produced lower estimated ultimate losses  resulting in lower estimates of required ibnr 
additionally  during the year ended december   autoone experienced million of adverse loss reserve development 

table of contents unpaid loss and lae reserves by line of business unpaid loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  at december  and were as follows december  december  case ibnr total case ibnr total in millions ongoing business runoff business total amounts included in runoff business as of december  include case and ibnr reserves that have been reclassified to liabilities held for sale in the december  consolidated balance sheet 
unpaid loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  for our ongoing business by line of business at december  and were as follows december  december  case ibnr total case ibnr total in millions automobile liability general liability occurrence general liability claims made medical malpractice other casualty workers compensation property other total range of reserves our range of reserve estimates at december  was evaluated to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the actuarial methods applied against our historical claims experience data 
the following table shows the recorded unpaid loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses  and the high and low ends of our range of reasonable loss and lae reserve estimates at december  the high and low ends of our range of reserve estimates in the table below are based on the results of various actuarial methods described above 
december  low recorded high in millions ongoing business runoff business 
table of contents the following table shows the recorded reserves and the high and low ends of our range of reasonable loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  estimates for our ongoing business by line of business at december  december  low recorded high in millions automobile liability general liability occurrence general liability claims medical malpractice other casualty workers compensation property other total the recorded reserves represent management best estimate of unpaid loss and lae by line of business 
we use the results of several different actuarial methods to develop our estimate of ultimate reserves 
while we have not determined the statistical probability of actual ultimate paid losses falling within the range  management believes that it is reasonably likely that actual ultimate paid losses will fall within the ranges noted above because the ranges were developed by using several different generally accepted actuarial methods 
the probability that ultimate losses will fall outside of the ranges of estimates by line of business is higher for each line of business individually than it is for the sum of the estimates for all lines taken together due to the effects of diversification 
the diversification effects result from the fact that losses across our different lines of business are not completely correlated 
although management believes our reserves are reasonably stated  ultimate losses may deviate  perhaps materially  from the recorded reserve amounts and could be above the high end of the range of actuarial projections 
this is because ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date  whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that may be unknown as of the valuation date 
the percentages shown in the following table represent the linear interpolation of where onebeacon recorded loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  are within the range of reserves estimates at december  and  where the low end of the range equals zero  the middle of the range equals and the high end of the range equals 
the middle of the range does not necessarily represent the actuarial indication within the range of possible outcomes 
during  we modeled the range of reserves for our ongoing business at a more refined line of business level than we had previously used  the prior period has been restated to reflect the more refined range 
december  expressed as a percentage of the range ongoing business runoff business total in selecting its best estimate  management continues to monitor the impact of future increases in inflation  including adverse changes in tort liability 
these types of changes could result in deterioration in the loss reserves 
during  inflation continued to emerge in the loss data for some lines of business which increased the actuarial indications and related estimated range of outcomes 
since these changes in inflation assumptions are now being partially reflected in the actuarial methods  management does not need to select reserves as high in the range of actuarial indications 
this has had some impact on most lines but has a particular impact on general liability claims made and medical malpractice within both onebeacon ongoing business and its runoff business 
additionally  as onebeacon continues to pay down the obligations associated with its runoff 
table of contents business  the uncertainly and volatility associated with those reserves is also declining such that carried reserves  which continue to exceed actuarial indications  are expectedly closer to the middle of the range 
also in  as discussed above  management lowered held reserves in several businesses that had been previously managed as part of onebeacon former commercial lines underwriting group 
this development was primarily workers compensation and general liability occurrence 
this favorable development resulted in recorded reserves being lower in the range as of december  compared to december the percentages shown in the following table represent the linear interpolation of where our recorded loss and lae reserves on our ongoing business  net of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses  are within the range of reserves estimates by line of business at december  and similar to the preceding table  the low end of the range equals zero  the middle of the range equals and the high end of the range equals 
december  expressed as a percentage of the range automobile liability general liability occurrence general liability claims medical malpractice other casualty workers compensation property other total sensitivity analysis the following discussion includes disclosure of possible variations from current estimates of loss reserves in our ongoing business and runoff businesses due to a change in certain key assumptions 
each of the impacts described below is estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for our reserves in total 
it is important to note that the variations discussed are not meant to be a worst case scenario  and therefore  it is possible that future variations may be more than amounts discussed below 
workers compensation recorded loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  for ongoing and runoff business workers compensation were million at december  the two most important assumptions for workers compensation reserves are loss development factors and loss cost trends  particularly medical cost inflation 
loss development patterns are dependent on medical cost inflation 
approximately half of the workers compensation net reserves are related to future medical costs 
across the entire reserve base  a point change in calendar year medical inflation would have changed the estimated net reserve by approximately million at december   in either direction 
professional liability recorded loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  for professional liability were million at december  a key assumption for professional liability is the implicit loss cost trend  particularly the severity inflation trend component of loss costs 
across the entire reserve base  a point change in assumed annual severity would have changed the estimated net reserve by approximately million at december   in either direction 
multiple peril liability recorded loss and lae reserves for the ongoing and runoff businesses  net of reinsurance recoverables excluding the grc cover  for multiple peril were million at december  reported loss development patterns are a key assumption for these lines of business  particularly for more mature accident years 
historically  assumptions on reported loss development patterns have been impacted by  among other things  emergence of new types of claims eg construction defect claims or a shift in the mixture between smaller  more routine claims and larger  more complex claims 
if case reserve adequacy for multiple peril claims changed by points this would have changed the estimated net reserve by approximately million at december   in either direction 

table of contents reinsurance transactions our insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance from time to time to protect their businesses from losses due to exposure aggregation  to manage their operating leverage ratios and to limit ultimate losses arising from catastrophic events 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policies 
amounts related to reinsurance contracts are recorded in accordance with asc in connection with the onebeacon acquisition  aviva caused us to purchase reinsurance contracts with two reinsurance companies rated a superior  the highest of sixteen financial strength ratings by am best and aa very strong  the second highest of twenty one financial strength ratings by standard poor 
one is a reinsurance cover with nico which entitles us to recover up to billion in ultimate loss and lae incurred related to asbestos claims arising from business written prior to  environmental claims arising from business written prior to and certain other latent exposures 
as of december   we have ceded estimated incurred losses of approximately billion to nico under the nico cover 
the other contract is a reinsurance cover with grc for up to million of additional losses on all claims arising from accident years and prior 
as of december   we have ceded estimated incurred losses of million to grc under the grc cover 
the nico cover and grc cover  which were contingent on and occurred contemporaneously with the onebeacon acquisition  were put in place in lieu of a seller guarantee of loss and lae reserves and are therefore accounted for as a seller guarantee under gaap 
nico and grc are wholly owned subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway inc all of these balances relate to the runoff business  the operations of which are included in discontinued operations and the balances as of december  of which have been included in assets or liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity market prices and other relevant market rates and prices 
due to our sizable investment portfolio  market risk can have a significant effect on onebeacon consolidated financial position 
interest rate risk fixed maturity and convertible fixed maturity portfolios 
in connection with our consolidated insurance subsidiaries  we invest in interest rate sensitive securities  primarily debt securities 
our strategy is to purchase fixed maturity investments and convertible fixed maturity investments that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risks 
our portfolio of fixed maturity investments held for general investment purposes are classified as trading securities which are reported at fair value as of the balance sheet date as determined by quoted market prices when available 
realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on trading securities are reported pre tax in revenues 
our convertible fixed maturity investments are carried at fair value with changes therein recorded in revenues as unrealized investment gains or losses 
we generally manage the interest rate risk associated with our portfolio of fixed maturity investments and convertible fixed maturity investments by monitoring the average duration of the portfolio 
our fixed maturity and convertible fixed maturity portfolios are comprised of primarily investment grade corporate securities  us government and agency securities  municipal obligations and mortgage backed securities 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity and convertible fixed maturity investments  respectively 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other market factors

long term obligations 
as of december   our interest and dividend bearing long term obligations consisted of the senior notes which have a fixed interest rate 
as a result  our exposure to interest rate risk resulting from variable interest rate obligations is insignificant 
the senior notes were issued in and mature on november  at december   the fair value of the senior notes was million  which compared to a carrying value of million 
the fair value of this obligation was estimated by using quoted market prices 
credit spread risk sensitivity analysis of spread risk our overall fixed maturity investment strategy is to purchase securities that are attractively priced in relation to their investment risks 
widening and tightening of spreads generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments  respectively 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical widening and tightening of pre tax credit spreads for different classes of our fixed maturity and convertible fixed maturity portfolios 
in estimating the impact of hypothetical tightening of spreads  for fixed maturity investments yielding more than the year constant maturity treasury index cmt index as of december   to the extent their yields would have decreased to levels lower than the year cmt index as of december   we limited their price appreciation to a level equal to the yield of the year cmt index

equity price risk the carrying values of our common equity securities and other long term equity investments are based on quoted market prices or management estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet date 
market prices of common equity securities  in general  are subject to fluctuations 
these fluctuations could cause the amount realized upon sale or exercise of these instruments to differ significantly from the current reported value 
the fluctuations may result from perceived changes in the 
table of contents underlying economic characteristics of the investment  the relative price of alternative investments  supply and demand imbalances for a particular security or other market factors 
sensitivity analysis of likely changes in fair values of common equity securities  hedge fund and private equity fund investments our investment portfolio includes investments in common equity securities  hedge funds and private equity funds 
the underlying investments of the hedge funds and private equity funds are typically publicly traded and private common equity investments  and  as such  are subject to market risks that are similar to those in our common equity portfolio 
the following illustrates the estimated pre tax effect on december  fair values carried on the consolidated balance sheet  resulting from hypothetical changes in market value change in fair value decline increase decline increase in millions common equity securities hedge funds private equity funds returns on common equity securities are measured against the s p index 
hedge funds and private equity funds returns are commonly measured against the benchmark returns of hedge fund indices  such as the hfrx equal weighted strategies index  and or the s p index 
the historical returns for each index in the past full years are listed below year ended december  hfrx equal weighted strategies index s p index foreign exposure risk our investment portfolio consists of financial and non financial fixed maturity  common equity and convertible fixed maturity investments issued by more than countries worldwide 
the united states represents the country of issue for approximately of our fixed maturity  common equity and convertible fixed maturity portfolio and we have minimal sovereign risk exposure to european peripheral countries such as ireland  greece  portugal  spain and italy 
our direct exposure to these countries is comprised solely of non financial common equity securities and represents only of our fixed maturity  common equity and convertible fixed maturity investments at december  in addition  we could have indirect exposure to european peripheral countries through securities issued from non peripheral countries as issuers of those securities could have exposure to european peripheral countries
