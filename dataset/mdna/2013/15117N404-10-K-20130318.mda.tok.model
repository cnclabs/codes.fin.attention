item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for additional information regarding expenditures related to our research and development programs 
fda regulation research and development our research and development activities  pre clinical tests and clinical trials are subject to extensive regulation by the fda as would the manufacturing  marketing and labeling of our products  if any 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the public health service act and the regulations promulgated by the fda govern  among other things  the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising  promotion  import and export of our products 
under these statutes  our heat activated liposomes will be regulated as a new drug 
the steps ordinarily required before such products can be marketed in the us include a pre clinical and clinical studies  b the submission to the fda of an application for  or approval  as an investigational new drug application ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  c adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product  d the submission to the fda of a new drug application nda  and e fda approval of the application  including approval of all product labeling 
pre clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  formulation and stability  as well as animal studies  to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product 
pre clinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with fda regulations regarding good laboratory practice 
the results of pre clinical tests are submitted to the fda as part of an ind and are reviewed by the fda before the commencement of human clinical trials 
submission of an ind will not necessarily result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials  and the absence of fda objection to an ind does not necessarily mean that the fda will ultimately approve an nda or that a product candidate otherwise will come to market 
clinical trials involve the administration of therapy to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices under protocols submitted to the fda as part of an ind 
also  each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an internal review board irb  and with patient informed consent 
an irb will consider  among other things  ethical factors and the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution conducting the clinical trials 
clinical trials are typically conducted in two or three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
phase i clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the therapy to a small number of subjects 
phase ii trials are generally larger trials conducted in the target population 
phase ii studies may serve as the pivotal trials  providing the demonstration of safety and effectiveness required for approval 
however  the fda may require additional  post market trials as a condition of approval 
in the case of drugs and biological products  phase ii clinical trials generally are conducted in a target patient population to gather evidence about the pharmacokinetics  safety and biological or clinical efficacy of the drug for specific indications  to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when a drug or biological compound has shown evidence of efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  phase iii clinical trials are undertaken to serve as the pivotal trials to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population 
there can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials will be completed successfully within any specified time period or at all 
on january   we announced that thermodox in combination with rfa did not meet the primary endpoint of the heat study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma hcc  also known as primary liver cancer 
specifically  we determined  after conferring with the dmc  that the heat study did not meet the goal of demonstrating persuasive evidence of clinical effectiveness that could form the basis for regulatory approval in the population chosen for the heat study 
either the fda or we may suspend clinical trials at any time  if the fda  our data monitoring committee  or we conclude that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for other reasons 
the fda inspects and reviews clinical trial sites  informed consent forms  data from the clinical trial sites including case report forms and record keeping procedures and the performance of the protocols by clinical trial personnel to determine compliance with good clinical practices 
the fda also examines whether there was bias in the conduct of clinical trials 
the conduct of clinical trials is complex and difficult  especially in pivotal phase ii or phase iii trials 
there can be no assurance that the design or the performance of the pivotal clinical trial protocols or any of our current or future product candidates will be successful 
the results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials  if successful  are submitted in an application for fda approval to market the drug or biological product for a specified use 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time and effort  and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted for any product at any time  according to any schedule  or at all 
the fda may refuse to accept or approve an application if it believes that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied 
the fda may also require additional testing for safety and efficacy 
moreover  if regulatory approval is granted  the approval will be limited to specific indications 
there can be no assurance that any of our current product candidates will receive regulatory approvals for marketing or  if approved  that approval will be for any or all of the indications that we request 
the fda is authorized to require various user fees  including nda fees currently up to million 
the fda may waive or reduce such user fees under certain circumstances  such as orphan drug designation for a product candidate 
we will seek waivers or reductions of user fees where possible  but we cannot be assured that we will be eligible for any such waiver or reduction 
post approval requirements after receipt of necessary regulatory approvals  if any  for initial manufacturing and sale of our product candidates  our contract manufacturing facilities and products are subject to ongoing review and periodic inspection 
each us drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda 
manufacturing establishments in the us and abroad are subject to inspections by the fda and must comply with current good manufacturing practices 
in order to ensure full technical compliance with such practices  manufacturers must expend funds  time and effort in the areas of production and quality control 
in addition  the fda may impose post approval requirements on us  including the requirement that we conduct specified post marketing studies 
inspections we are subject to the periodic inspection of our clinical trials  facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of our products by the fda to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with fda regulations 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of an fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter only is to be issued for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
recalls the fda has the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in manufacture 
a governmentally mandated recall  or a voluntary recall by us  could result from a number of events or factors  including component failures  manufacturing errors  instability of product or defects in labeling 
other fda regulations we are also subject to recordkeeping and reporting regulations 
these regulations require  among other things  the reporting to the fda of adverse events alleged to have been associated with the use of a product or in connection with certain product failures 
labeling and promotional activities are also regulated by the fda 
we must also comply with record keeping requirements as well as requirements to report certain adverse events involving our products 
the fda can impose other post marketing controls on us as well as our products including  but not limited to  restrictions on sale and use  through the approval process  regulations and otherwise 
product liability and insurance our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products 
we presently have product liability insurance limited to million per incident  and if we were to be subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded  we would be required to pay the claim out of our own limited resources 
competition competition in the discovery and development of new methods for treating and preventing disease is intense 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies both in the us and abroad 
we face significant competition from organizations pursuing the same or similar technologies used by us in our drug discovery efforts and from organizations developing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with our product candidates 
most of our competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  most of these organizations  either alone or together with their collaborators  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products  and manufacturing and marketing products 
mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among our competitors 
these companies  as well as academic institutions  governmental agencies  and private research organizations  also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants 
our ability to compete successfully with other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology field also depends on the status of our collaborations and on the continuing availability of capital to us 
thermodox although there are many drugs and devices marketed and under development for the treatment of cancer  the company is not aware of any other heat activated drug delivery product either being marketed or in human clinical development 
licenses  patents  trademarks and regulatory exclusivity in  the company entered into a license agreement with duke university under which we received exclusive rights  subject to certain exceptions  to commercialize and use duke s thermo liposome technology 
in relation to these liposome patents licensed from duke university  we have filed two additional patents related to the formulation and use of liposomes 
we have also licensed from valentis  ca certain global rights covering the use of pegylation for temperature sensitive liposomes 
in  our obligations under the license agreement with duke university with respect to the testing and regulatory milestones and other licensed technology performance deadlines were eliminated in exchange for a payment of shares of our common stock 
the license agreement continues to be subject to agreements to pay a royalty based upon future sales 
in conjunction with the patent holder  we have filed international applications for a certain number of the united states patents 
our rights under the license agreement with duke university extend for the longer of years or the end of any term for which any relevant patents are issued by the united states patent and trademark office 
currently  the company has rights to duke s patent for its thermo liposome technology in the united states  which expires in  and to future patents received by duke in canada  europe  japan and australia  where it has patent applications have been granted 
the european grant provides coverage in the european community 
for this technology  the company s license rights are worldwide  including the united states  canada  certain european countries  australia  hong kong  and japan 
in  the fda granted orphan drug designation for thermodox for the treatment of hcc 
orphan drug designation entitles the company to seven years of market exclusivity following fda approval  if any  fda assistance in clinical trial design  a reduction in fda user fees  us tax credits related to development expenses as well as the opportunity to apply for funding from the us government to defray the costs of clinical trial expenses 
in  the european commission granted orphan drug designation for thermodox for the treatment of hcc in europe 
as established by the european medicine agency ema  orphan drug designation provides for scientific advice and regulatory assistance from the ema  direct access to centralized marketing authorization and certain financial incentives  such as reduction of fees associated with pre authorization inspections and marketing authorization application fees 
the orphan drug designation in europe also provides years of market exclusivity subsequent to product approval 
on february   celsion announced that its proprietary patent application  method of storing nanoparticle formulations  had been allowed in china and granted in south korea and australia 
celsion holds an exclusive license agreement with duke university for its temperature sensitive liposome technology that covers the thermodox formulation 
celsion newly issued patents pertain specifically to methods of storing stabilized  temperature sensitive liposomal formulations and will assist in the protection of global rights 
these patents will extend the overall term of the thermodox patent portfolio to the patents in these three countries are the first in this family  which includes pending applications in the us  europe and additional key commercial geographies in asia 
this extended patent runway to allows for the evaluation of future development activities for thermodox and celsion heat sensitive liposome technology platform 
in addition to the rights available to us under completed or pending license agreements  we rely on our proprietary know how and experience in the development and use of heat for medical therapies  which we seek to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and others 
there can be no assurance that these proprietary information agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that these agreements  even if fully enforced  will be adequate to prevent third party use of the company s proprietary technology 
please refer to item a  risk factors  including  but not limited to  we rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies  and any loss of such rights could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
similarly  we cannot guarantee that technology rights licensed to us by others will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties  or that the rights granted will provide us with adequate protection 
please refer to item a  risk factors  including  but not limited to  our business depends on licensing agreements with third parties to permit us to use patented technologies 
the loss of any of our rights under these agreements could impair our ability to develop and market our products 
employees as of march   we employed full time employees 
we also maintain active independent contractor relationships with various individuals  most of whom have month to month or annual consulting agreements 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and we consider our relations with our employees to be good

liquidity and capital resources during  we received approximately million of gross proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase approximately million shares of the company s common stock and million of gross proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
on june   the company entered into a loan and security agreement the credit agreement with oxford finance llc oxford and horizon technology finance corporation horizon 
the credit agreement provides for a secured term loan of up to million  with of any loans to be funded by oxford and to be funded by horizon 
the aggregate loan amount may be advanced in two tranches of million each 
the first tranche the term a loan of million was made available to the company on june  and the second tranche the term b loan was to be made available  if at all  during the period beginning on the date that the company achieved positive data in its phase iii clinical trial of rfa and thermodox the heat study and ending on march  on january   the company announced it did not meet the primary endpoint of the heat study  therefore the term b loan will not be drawn down 
the term a loan is scheduled to mature on october  the proceeds of the credit agreement will be used to fund the company s working capital and general corporate purposes 
the obligations under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all assets of the company other than its intellectual property and certain other agreed upon exclusions 
the term a loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 
for an initial period extending for the term a loan through may   the company is only required to make interest payments  after which the company is required to make consecutive equal monthly payments of principle and interest to each lender as calculated pursuant to the credit agreement 
the company was also obligated to pay other customary facility fees for a credit facility of this size and type 
as a fee in connection with the credit agreement  the company issued warrants to horizon and oxford to purchase the number of shares of the company s common stock equal to of each loan amount divided by the exercise price equal to per share  which is calculated as the average nasdaq closing price of celsion common stock for the three days prior to the funding of the loan amount 
this results in  warrant shares issuable in connection with the term a loan 
the warrants are immediately exercisable for cash or by net exercise and will expire seven years after their issuance 
recent events on january   we announced that thermodox in combination with rfa did not meet the primary endpoint of the heat study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma  also known as primary liver cancer 
specifically  we determined  after conferring with the dmc  that the heat study did not meet the goal of demonstrating persuasive evidence of clinical effectiveness that could form the basis for regulatory approval in the population chosen for the heat study 
the heat study was designed to show a percent improvement in pfs with percent power and a p value 
in the trial  thermodox was well tolerated with no unexpected serious adverse events 
we will continue following the patients enrolled in the heat study to the secondary endpoint  overall survival 
hisun technology development contract on january   we entered into a technology development contract with hisun  pursuant to which hisun paid us a non refundable research and development fee of million to support our development of thermodox and we will provide research data and other technical support in relation to a regulatory filing by hisun with the sfda for approval of thermodox for manufacturing and sale in mainland china  hong kong and macau 
on january   we also entered into an exclusive option agreement with hisun  terminable at any time by hisun  under which we granted hisun an option to enter into an exclusive license agreement with us for the manufacturing and commercialization of thermodox with respect to all indications in the china territory under the terms and conditions set forth in the exclusive option agreement and other customary terms and conditions to be set forth in the license agreement  if any 
hisun agreed to pay us an additional million within sixty days after the signing of the exclusive option agreement if it has not been terminated within such time period 
the exclusive option agreement contemplated payments of an upfront license fee  milestone payments and royalties to us if the exclusive license agreement were entered into 
following our announcement on january  that thermodox in combination with rfa did not meet the primary endpoint of the phase iii clinical trial for primary liver cancer  hisun elected to terminate the exclusive option agreement and not to pursue the option to enter into an exclusive license agreement with us for the china territory  which termination took effect as of february  as a result of the termination  we will not receive the additional million payment or any future payment originally contemplated by the exclusive option agreement 
the technology development contract will remain in effect while hisun and we continue to collaborate and are evaluating next steps in relation to thermodox  which include the sub group analysis of the chinese cohort of patients in the phase iii clinical trial for primary liver cancer and other activities to further the development of thermodox for mainland china  hong kong and macau 
at the market offerings on february   the company entered into a controlled equity offering sm sales agreement the atm agreement with cantor fitzgerald co  as sales agent cantor  pursuant to which celsion may offer and sell  from time to time  through cantor  shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million the atm shares 
the atm shares will be issued pursuant to the company s previously filed and effective registration statement on form s the base prospectus dated september   filed as part of such registration statement  and the prospectus supplement dated february   filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
under the agreement  cantor may sell atm shares by any method deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in rule promulgated under the securities act of  as amended  including sales made directly on the nasdaq capital market  on any other existing trading market for the our common stock or to or through a market maker 
from february  through february   the company sold and issued  atm shares under the atm agreement  receiving approximately million in net proceeds 
celsion intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  including research and development activities  capital expenditures and working capital 
the company is not obligated to sell any atm shares under the atm agreement 
subject to the terms and conditions of the atm agreement  cantor will use commercially reasonable efforts  consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable state and federal law  rules and regulations and the rules of the nasdaq capital market  to sell atm shares from time to time based upon the company s instructions  including any price  time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions celsion may impose 
in addition  pursuant to the terms and conditions of the atm agreement and subject to the instructions of celsion  cantor may sell atm shares by any other method permitted by law  including in privately negotiated transactions 
the atm agreement will terminate upon the earlier of i the sale of shares under the atm agreement having an aggregate offering price of million and ii the termination of the atm agreement by cantor or the company 
the atm agreement may be terminated by cantor or celsion at any time upon days notice to the other party  or by cantor at any time in certain circumstances  including the occurrence of a material adverse change in celsion 
the company will pay cantor a commission of of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of atm shares and has agreed to provide cantor with customary indemnification and contribution rights 
the company also agreed to reimburse cantor for legal fees and disbursements  not to exceed  in the aggregate  in connection with entering into the atm agreement 
in connection with the preferred stock offering discussed below  the company agreed to not sell any atm shares for a period of one year from february  registered direct offering on february   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors  pursuant to which the company agreed to sell  in a registered offering  an aggregate of  shares of its series a convertible preferred stock and the warrants to purchase shares of its common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million the preferred stock offering 
the closing of the preferred stock offering occurred on february   in which the company received approximately million in gross proceeds 
subject to certain ownership limitations  shares of series a convertible preferred stock are convertible  at the option of the holder thereof  into an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock  and the warrants are exercisable to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock 
each warrant has an exercise price of per share  equal to the closing bid price of common stock on february  the warrants are immediately exercisable and expire five years after its issuance 
as of march   the company has issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock upon conversion of  shares of the series a convertible preferred stock 
warrant and option exercises during the first quarter of thus far  we received approximately million of gross proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
we believe that our cash and investment resources of million on hand at december   as well as the million of net proceeds the company collectively received thus far in the first quarter of from warrant exercises  the non refundable payment from hisun under the technology development agreement  the atm agreement and the preferred stock offering  is sufficient to fund operations through however  our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors  including  without limitation  the cost  timing and outcomes of clinical studies and regulatory reviews of our proprietary drug candidates  our efforts to implement new collaborations  licenses and strategic transactions  general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures and other uses of cash 
to complete the development and commercialization of our products  we will need to raise substantial amounts of additional capital to fund our operations 
we do not have any committed sources of financing and cannot give assurance that alternate funding will be available in a timely manner  on acceptable terms or at all 
we may need to pursue dilutive equity financings  such as the issuance of shares of common stock  convertible debt or other convertible or exercisable securities  which financings could dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock 
item a 
risk factors the following is a summary of the risk factors  uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are most relevant to our business 
these are factors that  individually or in the aggregate  we think could cause our actual results to differ significantly from anticipated or historical results and our forward looking statements 
you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
moreover  we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosure we make on related subjects in our reports on forms q and k filed with the sec 
risks related to our business we have a history of significant losses from continuing operations and expect to continue such losses for the foreseeable future 
since our inception  our expenses have substantially exceeded our revenues  resulting in continuing losses and an accumulated deficit of million at december  for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million 
because we presently have no product revenues and we are committed to continuing our product research  development and commercialization programs  we will continue to experience significant operating losses unless and until we complete the development of thermodox and other new products and these products have been clinically tested  approved by the us food and drug administration fda and successfully marketed 
drug development is an inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development 
our lead drug candidate failed to meets its primary endpoint in the phase iii heat study 
we have a number of drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials 
preclinical testing and clinical trials are long  expensive and highly uncertain processes and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of clinical development 
drug development is very risky 
it will take us several years to complete clinical trials 
the start or end of a clinical trial is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements  manufacturing challenges  required clinical trial administrative actions  slower than anticipated patient enrollment  changing standards of care  availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy  clinical outcomes including insufficient efficacy  safety concerns  or our own financial constraints 
on january   we announced that our lead product thermodox in combination with radiofrequency ablation failed to meet the primary endpoint of the phase iii clinical trial for primary liver cancer the heat study 
we have not completed our analysis of the data and do not know the extent to which  if any  the failure of thermodox to meet its primary endpoint in the phase iii trial could impact our other ongoing studies of thermodox 
thermodox is also being evaluated in a phase ii clinical trial for colorectal liver metastasis  a phase ii clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer and other preclinical studies 
even with success in preclinical testing and previously completed clinical trials  the risk of clinical failure for any drug candidate remains high prior to regulatory approval 
even if thermodox has positive results in its phase ii clinical trials  there is a substantial risk that it will fail to have sufficiently positive results in phase iii clinical trials with regard to efficacy  safety or other clinical outcomes 
one or more of our clinical studies could fail at any time  as evidenced by the failure of thermodox to meet its primary endpoint in the heat study 
the failure of one or more of our drug candidates or development programs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not obtain or maintain fda and foreign regulatory approvals for our drug candidates on a timely basis  or at all  or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use  we will be unable to sell those products and our business  results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected 
to obtain regulatory approvals from the fda and foreign regulatory agencies  we must conduct clinical trials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective 
we may need to amend ongoing trials or the fda and or foreign regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional trials beyond those we planned 
this process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
the time required for completing testing and obtaining approvals is uncertain  and the fda and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion  at any phase of development  to terminate clinical studies  require additional clinical development or other testing  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals  including recalls 
in addition  undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities 
even if we receive regulatory approval of a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed 
the failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates  any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we do not expect to generate significant revenue for the foreseeable future 
we have devoted our resources to developing a new generation of products and will not be able to market these products until we have completed clinical trials and obtain all necessary governmental approvals 
our lead product candidate  thermodox  is still in various stages of development and trials and cannot be marketed until we have completed clinical testing and obtained necessary governmental approval 
following our announcement on january  that the heat study failed to meet its primary endpoint of progression free survival  we will continue to follow the patients enrolled in the heat study to the secondary endpoint  overall survival 
thermodox is currently also being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials and other preclinical studies 
we do not expect to realize any revenues from product sales in the next several years  if at all 
accordingly  our revenue sources are  and will remain  extremely limited until our product candidates are clinically tested  approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies and successfully marketed 
we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be successfully tested  approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agency or marketed  successfully or otherwise  at any time in the foreseeable future or at all 
we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our planned future operations  and we may be unable to secure such capital without dilutive financing transactions 
if we are not able to raise additional capital  we may not be able to complete the development  testing and commercialization of our product candidates 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we have substantial future capital requirements to continue our research and development activities and advance our drug candidates through various development stages 
for example  thermodox is being evaluated in a phase ii clinical trial for colorectal liver metastasis  a phase ii clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer and other preclinical studies 
we will conduct additional analyses of the data from the heat study to assess the future strategic value of thermodox and are performing sub group analysis of the chinese cohort of patients in the heat study and other activities for further development of thermodox for mainland china  hong kong and macau 
to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we will need to raise substantial amounts of additional capital to fund our operations 
we do not have any committed sources of financing and cannot assure you that alternate funding will be available in a timely manner  on acceptable terms or at all 
we may need to pursue dilutive equity financings  such as the issuance of shares of common stock  convertible debt or other convertible or exercisable securities 
such dilutive equity financings could dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock 
in addition  a financing could result in the issuance of new securities that may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through unfavorable arrangements with partners or others that may force us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets or that could impose onerous financial or other terms 
furthermore  if we cannot fund our ongoing development and other operating requirements  particularly those associated with our obligations to conduct clinical trials under our licensing agreements  we will be in breach of these licensing agreements and could therefore lose our license rights  which could have material adverse effects on our business 
we have no internal sales or marketing capability 
if we are unable to create sales  marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into alliances with others possessing such capabilities to perform these functions  we will not be able to commercialize our products successfully 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
we intend to market our products  if and when such products are approved for commercialization by the fda and foreign regulatory agencies  either directly or through other strategic alliances and distribution arrangements with third parties 
if we decide to market our products directly  we will need to commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution  administration and compliance capabilities 
if we rely on third parties with such capabilities to market our products  we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into third party marketing or distribution arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
to the extent that we do enter into such arrangements  we will be dependent on our marketing and distribution partners 
in entering into third party marketing or distribution arrangements  we expect to incur significant additional expense and there can be no assurance that such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance for our products and services 
our business depends on license agreements with third parties to permit us to use patented technologies 
the loss of any of our rights under these agreements could impair our ability to develop and market our products 
our success will depend  in a substantial part  on our ability to maintain our rights under license agreements granting us rights to use patented technologies 
we have entered into license agreements with duke university  under which we have exclusive rights to commercialize medical treatment products and procedures based on duke s thermo sensitive liposome technology 
the duke university license agreement contains a license fee  royalty and or research support provisions  testing and regulatory milestones  and other performance requirements that we must meet by certain deadlines 
additionally  we have a joint research agreement with philips healthcare  a division of royal philips electronics  to evaluate the combination of philips high intensity focused ultrasound hifu with thermodox to determine the potential of this combination to treat a broad range of cancers 
if we breach any provisions of the license and research agreements  we may our ability to use the subject technology  as well as compensation for our efforts in developing or exploiting the technology 
any such loss of rights and access to technology could have a material adverse effect on our business 
further  we cannot guarantee that any patent or other technology rights licensed to us by others will not be challenged or circumvented successfully by third parties  or that the rights granted will provide adequate protection 
we may be required to alter any of our potential products or processes  or enter into a license and pay licensing fees to a third party or cease certain activities 
there can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms  if at all  or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology 
if a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  our business  results of operations  and financial condition could be significantly harmed and we may be prevented from developing and commercializing the product 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us or to determine the scope and validity of others claimed proprietary rights 
we rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies  and any loss of such rights could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on trade secrets and confidential information that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners  collaborators  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements are adequate to protect our trade secrets and confidential information or will not be breached or  if breached  we will have adequate remedies 
furthermore  others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology 
any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products may infringe patent rights of others  which may require costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could cause us to pay substantial damages or limit our ability to commercialize our products 
our commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
there may be third party patents that relate to our products and technology 
we may unintentionally infringe upon valid patent rights of third parties 
although we currently are not involved in any material litigation involving patents  a third party patent holder may assert a claim of patent infringement against us in the future 
alternatively  we may initiate litigation against the third party patent holder to request that a court declare that we are not infringing the third party s patent and or that the third party s patent is invalid or unenforceable 
if a claim of infringement is asserted against us and is successful  and therefore we are found to infringe  we could be required to pay damages for infringement  including treble damages if it is determined that we knew or became aware of such a patent and we failed to exercise due care in determining whether or not we infringed the patent 
if we have supplied infringing products to third parties or have licensed third parties to manufacture  use or market infringing products  we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses they may sustain 
we can also be prevented from selling or commercializing any of our products that use the infringing technology in the future  unless we obtain a license from such third party 
a license may not be available from such third party on commercially reasonable terms  or may not be available at all 
any modification to include a non infringing technology may not be possible or if possible may be difficult or time consuming to develop  and require revalidation  which could delay our ability to commercialize our products 
any infringement action asserted against us  even if we are ultimately successful in defending against such action  would likely delay the regulatory approval process of our products  harm our competitive position  be expensive and require the time and attention of our key management and technical personnel 
we rely on third parties to conduct all of our clinical trials 
if these third parties are unable to carry out their contractual duties in a manner that is consistent with our expectations  comply with budgets and other financial obligations or meet expected deadlines  we may not receive certain development milestone payments or be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates in a timely or cost effective manner 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third party clinical research organizations to conduct our clinical trials 
because we do not conduct our own clinical trials  we must rely on the efforts of others and cannot always control or predict accurately the timing of such trials  the costs associated with such trials or the procedures that are followed for such trials 
we do not expect to significantly increase our personnel in the foreseeable future and may continue to rely on third parties to conduct all of our future clinical trials 
if these third parties are unable to carry out their contractual duties or obligations in a manner that is consistent with our expectations or meet expected deadlines  if they do not carry out the trials in accordance with budgeted amounts  if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons  or if they fail to maintain compliance with applicable government regulations and standards  our clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated or may become significantly expensive  we may not receive development milestone payments when expected or at all  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates 
our business is subject to numerous and evolving state  federal and foreign regulations and we may not be able to secure the government approvals needed to develop and market our products 
our research and development activities  pre clinical tests and clinical trials  and ultimately the manufacturing  marketing and labeling of our products  are all subject to extensive regulation by the fda and foreign regulatory agencies 
pre clinical testing and clinical trial requirements and the regulatory approval process typically take years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
additional government regulation may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
delays or rejections in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect our ability to commercialize any product candidates and our ability to generate product revenues or royalties 
the fda and foreign regulatory agencies require that the safety and efficacy of product candidates be supported through adequate and well controlled clinical trials 
if the results of pivotal clinical trials do not establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of the fda and other foreign regulatory agencies  we will not receive the approvals necessary to market such product candidates 
even if regulatory approval of a product candidate is granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed 
we are subject to the periodic inspection of our clinical trials  facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of our products by the fda to determine whether our systems and processes  or those of our vendors and suppliers  are in compliance with fda regulations 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of an fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
failure to comply with the fda and other governmental regulations can result in fines  unanticipated compliance expenditures  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of product applications  enforcement actions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted product approvals 
although we have internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
we are also subject to recordkeeping and reporting regulations 
these regulations require  among other things  the reporting to the fda of adverse events alleged to have been associated with the use of a product or in connection with certain product failures 
labeling and promotional activities also are regulated by the fda 
we must also comply with record keeping requirements as well as requirements to report certain adverse events involving our products 
the fda can impose other post marketing controls on us as well as our products including  but not limited to  restrictions on sale and use  through the approval process  regulations and otherwise 
many states in which we do or may do business  or in which our products may be sold  if at all  impose licensing  labeling or certification requirements that are in addition to those imposed by the fda 
there can be no assurance that one or more states will not impose regulations or requirements that have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products 
in many of the foreign countries in which we may do business or in which our products may be sold  we will be subject to regulation by national governments and supranational agencies as well as by local agencies affecting  among other things  product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
there can be no assurance that one or more countries or agencies will not impose regulations or requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products 
legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations 
there have been a number of government and private sector initiatives during the last few years to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  competitive pricing  coverage and payment policies  comparative effectiveness of therapies  technology assessments and managed care arrangements 
it is uncertain whether or when any legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal  state  or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation 
we cannot predict the effect healthcare reforms may have on our business and we can offer no assurances that any of these reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
these actual and potential changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective treatments 
in addition  uncertainty remains regarding proposed significant reforms to the us health care system 
the success of our products may be harmed if the government  private health insurers and other third party payers do not provide sufficient coverage or reimbursement 
our ability to commercialize our new cancer treatment systems successfully will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
the reimbursement status of newly approved medical products is subject to significant uncertainty 
we cannot guarantee that adequate third party insurance coverage will be available for us to establish and maintain price levels sufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in developing new therapies 
government  private health insurers and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing by the fda 
accordingly  even if coverage and reimbursement are provided by government  private health insurers and third party payors for uses of our products  market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected if the reimbursement available proves to be unprofitable for health care providers 
our products may not achieve sufficient acceptance by the medical community to sustain our business 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and third party payers as clinically useful  cost effective and safe 
any or our drug candidates may prove not to be effective in practice 
if testing and clinical practice do not confirm the safety and efficacy of our product candidates or even if further testing and clinical practice produce positive results but the medical community does not view these new forms of treatment as effective and desirable  our efforts to market our new products may fail  which would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the commercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict 
if the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate  it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue  results of operations and financial condition 
it is very difficult to predict the commercial potential of product candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments  including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles  changing standards of care  third party payor reimbursement standards  patient and physician preferences  the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction  and the availability of generic versions of our successful product candidates following approval by government health authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents 
if due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated  it could significantly and negatively impact the revenue potential for such drug candidate and would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
technologies for the treatment of cancer are subject to rapid change  and the development of treatment strategies that are more effective than our technologies could render our technologies obsolete 
various methods for treating cancer currently are  and in the future are expected to be  the subject of extensive research and development 
many possible treatments that are being researched  if successfully developed  may not require  or may supplant  the use of our technologies 
the successful development and acceptance of any one or more of these alternative forms of treatment could render our technology obsolete as a cancer treatment method 
we may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees that we need to implement our business strategy and develop our products and business 
our success depends significantly on the continued contributions of our executive officers  scientific and technical personnel and consultants  and on our ability to attract additional personnel as we seek to implement our business strategy and develop our products and businesses 
during our operating history  we have assigned many essential responsibilities to a relatively small number of individuals 
however  as our business and the demands on our key employees expand  we have been  and will continue to be  required to recruit additional qualified employees 
the competition for such qualified personnel is intense  and the loss of services of certain key personnel or our inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions could adversely affect our business 
further  we do not carry key man insurance on any of our personnel 
therefore  loss of the services of key personnel would not be ameliorated by the receipt of the proceeds from such insurance 
our success will depend in part on our ability to grow and diversify  which in turn will require that we manage and control our growth effectively 
our business strategy contemplates growth and diversification 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require that we continue to expend funds to improve our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
in addition  we must effectively expand  train and manage our employees 
we will be unable to manage our business effectively if we are unable to alleviate the strain on resources caused by growth in a timely and successful manner 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our growth and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we engage in acquisitions  reorganizations or business combinations  we will incur a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business operations or our stockholders 
we may consider strategic alternatives intended to further the development of our business  which may include acquiring businesses  technologies or products or entering into a business combination with another company 
if we do pursue such a strategy  we could  among other things issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt that may place strains on our operations  spend substantial operational  financial and management resources in integrating new businesses  personnel intellectual property  technologies and products  assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities  reprioritize our development programs and even cease development and commercialization of our drug candidates  suffer the loss of key personnel  or merge with  or otherwise enter into a business combination with  another company in which our stockholders would receive cash or shares of the other company or a combination of both on terms that certain of our stockholders may not deem desirable 
although we intend to evaluate and consider different strategic alternatives  we have no agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisition  reorganization or business combination at this time 
we face intense competition and the failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
there are many companies and other institutions engaged in research and development of various technologies for cancer treatment products that seek treatment outcomes similar to those that we are pursuing 
we believe that the level of interest by others in investigating the potential of possible competitive treatments and alternative technologies will continue and may increase 
potential competitors engaged in all areas of cancer treatment research in the united states and other countries include  among others  major pharmaceutical  specialized technology companies  and universities and other research institutions 
most of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  human and other resources  and may also have far greater experience than do we  both in pre clinical testing and human clinical trials of new products and in obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals 
one or more of these companies or institutions could succeed in developing products or other technologies that are more effective than the products and technologies that we have been or are developing  or which would render our technology and products obsolete and non competitive 
furthermore  if we are permitted to commence commercial sales of any of our products  we will also be competing  with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing  with companies having substantially greater resources and experience in these areas 
we may be subject to significant product liability claims and litigation 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products 
we presently have product liability insurance limited to million per incident and million annually 
if we were to be subject to a claim in excess of this coverage or to a claim not covered by our insurance and the claim succeeded  we would be required to pay the claim with our own limited resources  which could have a severe adverse effect on our business 
whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation  such litigation would harm the business by diverting the attention and resources of our management  consuming substantial amounts of our financial resources and by damaging our reputation 
additionally  we may not be able to maintain our product liability insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all 
risks related to our securities we do not generate operating income and will require additional financing in the future 
if additional capital is not available  we may have to curtail or cease operations 
our business currently does not generate the cash necessary to finance our operations 
since our inception  our expenses have substantially exceeded our revenues  resulting in continuing losses and an accumulated deficit of million at december  for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million 
we presently have no product revenue 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund research and development and to develop and commercialize our products 
our future capital needs depend on many factors  including the scope  duration and expenditures associated with our clinical trials  the outcome of potential licensing transactions  if any  competing technological developments and the regulatory approval process for our products 
we may seek to raise necessary funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
the failure of the heat study to demonstrate clinical effectiveness  in addition to general market conditions  may make it very difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets 
we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us  in order to raise additional funds through alliance  joint venture or licensing arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may have to delay  reduce or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs and reduce overall overhead expense 
such events could cause our independent registered public accounting firm to indicate that there may be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in future periods 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate significantly  which could result in substantial losses for investors and subject us to securities class action litigation 
the trading price for our common stock has been  and we expect it to continue to be  volatile 
our january  announcement that the heat study failed to meet its primary endpoint has resulted in significant volatility and a steep decline in the price of our common stock  a level of decline that could result in securities litigation 
plaintiffs securities litigation firms have publicly announced that they are investigating potential securities fraud claims that they may wish to make against us 
the price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors  including our historical and anticipated operating results  our financial situation  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it  and general market and economic conditions 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock  regardless of our financial condition  results of operations  business or prospect 
the closing price of our common stock had a high price of and a low price of in the week period ended december   a high price of and a low price of in the week period ended december and a high price of and a low price of from january  through march  among the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this risk factors section and other factors  including fluctuations in our quarterly operating results or the operating results of our competitors  variance in our financial performance from the expectations of investors  changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets  changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles  which could affect our financial results  failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success  conditions and trends in the markets we serve  changes in general economic  industry and market conditions  success of competitive products and services  changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  announcements of significant new products  contracts  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  changes in legislation or regulatory policies  practices or actions  the commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company  our general industry or both  recruitment or departure of key personnel  changes in our capital structure  such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt  actual or expected sales of our common stock by our stockholders  and the trading volume of our common stock 
in addition  the stock markets  in general  the nasdaq capital market and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular  may experience a loss of investor confidence 
such loss of investor confidence may result in extreme price and volume fluctuations in our common stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of our business  financial condition or results of operations 
these broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock and expose us to securities class action litigation 
such litigation  even if unsuccessful  could be costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources  which could further materially harm our financial condition and results of operations 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales might occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding  all of which shares  other than shares held by our directors and certain officers  were eligible for sale in the public market  subject in some cases to compliance with the requirements of rule  including the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements 
in addition  all of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration upon issuance 
our stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuances and exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
in order to raise additional capital or pursue strategic transactions  we may in the future offer  issue or sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock 
our stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of future equity offerings or issuance 
investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders 
as of march   we have a significant number of securities convertible into  or allowing the purchase of  our common stock  including  remaining shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our series a convertible preferred stock issued in the registered direct offering closed on february  and  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants outstanding   options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock awards outstanding  and  shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our stock incentive plans 
under the controlled equity offering sm sales agreement entered into with cantor fitzgerald co 
on february   we may offer and sell  from time to time through at the market offerings  up to an aggregate of million of shares of our common stock 
in connection with the series a convertible preferred stock offering  the company agreed to not sell any atm shares for a period of one year from february  we may be unable to maintain compliance with nasdaq marketplace rules which could cause our common stock to be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
this could result in the lack of a market for our common stock  cause a decrease in the value of an investment in us  and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on april   we received notice from the nasdaq listing qualifications department that we were not in compliance with the minimum market value of listed securities mvls requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market  as set forth in nasdaq listing rule b the rule  which requires a listed company to maintain a minimum mvls of million 
on may   we received a letter from nasdaq stating that our mvls had been million or greater for the previous ten consecutive business days from april  to may  and that we had regained compliance with the rule 
we cannot guarantee that our mvls will remain at or above million and if our mvls again drops below million  the stock could become subject to delisting again 
if our common stock is delisted  trading of the stock will most likely take place on an over the counter market established for unlisted securities  such as the pink sheets or the otc bulletin board 
an investor is likely to find it less convenient to sell  or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy  our common stock on an over the counter market  and many investors may not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over the counter markets  or due to policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons 
in addition  as a delisted security  our common stock would be subject to sec rules regarding penny stock  which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker dealers 
the regulations relating to penny stocks  coupled with the typically higher cost per trade to investors in penny stocks due to factors such as broker commissions generally representing a higher percentage of the price of a penny stock than of a higher priced stock  would further limit the ability and willingness of investors to trade in our common stock 
for these reasons and others  delisting would adversely affect the liquidity  trading volume and price of our common stock  causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our ability to attract and retain qualified executives and employees and to raise capital 
the adverse capital and credit market conditions could affect our liquidity 
adverse capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  as well as our access to capital and cost of capital 
the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years 
our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and capital position could be materially adversely affected by continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets 
our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income are subject to certain limitations 
we currently have significant net operating losses nols that may be used to offset future taxable income 
in general  under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change nols to offset future taxable income 
during and  the company performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership  as defined by section of the internal revenue code that would limit its ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company determined that it experienced an ownership change  as defined by section  in connection with its registered direct and private placement offerings on july  as a result  the utilization of the company s federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited 
future changes in our stock ownership  some of which are outside of our control  could result in an ownership change under section of the code  which would significantly limit our ability to utilize nols to offset future taxable income 
we have never paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for the foreseeable future for holders of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock 
this preferred stock may be issued by our board of directors on such terms as it determines  without further stockholder approval 
therefore  our board of directors may issue such preferred stock on terms unfavorable to a potential bidder in the event that our board of directors opposes a merger or acquisition 
in addition  our classified board of directors may discourage such transactions by increasing the amount of time necessary to obtain majority representation on our board of directors 
certain other provisions of our bylaws and of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us  even if such action were beneficial to some  or even a majority  of our stockholders

overview celsion is an oncology drug development company focused on the development of treatments for those suffering with difficult to treat forms of cancer 
we are working to develop and commercialize more efficient and effective targeted chemotherapeutic oncology drugs based on our proprietary heat activated liposomal technology 
the promise of this drug technology is to maximize efficacy while minimizing side effects common to cancer treatments 
significant events thermodox our lead product thermodox is being evaluated in a phase iii clinical trial for primary liver cancer the heat study  a phase ii clinical trial for colorectal liver metastasis crlm and a phase ii clinical trial for recurrent chest wall breast cancer 
thermodox is a liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin  an approved and frequently used oncology drug for the treatment of a wide range of cancers 
localized heat at mild hyperthermia temperatures greater than degrees celsius releases the encapsulated doxorubicin from the liposome enabling high concentrations of doxorubicin to be deposited preferentially in and around the targeted tumor 
the heat study for primary liver cancer the heat study for thermodox  in combination with radiofrequency ablation rfa  is being conducted under a special protocol assessment agreed to with the us food and drug administration fda 
the special protocol assessment agreed to with the fda specified progression free survival pfs as the heat study s primary endpoint 
we scheduled a meeting with the heat study independent data monitoring committee dmc on january  in order to conduct an analysis of the heat study s pfs endpoint 
following review by the dmc  on january   we announced that thermodox in combination with rfa did not meet the primary endpoint of the heat study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma hcc  also known as primary liver cancer 
specifically  we determined  after conferring with the dmc  that the heat study did not meet the goal of demonstrating persuasive evidence of clinical effectiveness that could form the basis for regulatory approval in the population chosen for the heat study 
the heat study was designed to show a percent improvement in pfs with percent power and a p value 
in the trial  thermodox was well tolerated with no unexpected serious adverse events 
we will continue following the patients enrolled in the heat study to the secondary endpoint  overall survival 
we will also conduct additional analyses of the data from the heat study to assess the future strategic value of thermodox 
we plan to continue with related partnerships  such as our arrangement with zhejiang hisun pharmaceutical co 
ltd 
hisun described below  to the extent feasible 
in addition  we will assess our product pipeline and research and development priorities 
as we evaluate strategic alternatives  we will need to consider a number of factors  including investment in  or acquisition of  complementary businesses  technologies or products  possible capital raising transactions  partnering opportunities and working capital requirements 
we expect that the strength of our balance sheet will afford us the opportunity to evaluate our future development plans 
however  as demonstrated by the heat study results announced on january   drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval 
the timing and the outcome of clinical results is extremely difficult to predict 
clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects  financial prospects  financial condition and market value 
prior to the heat study results announced on january   and consistent with our global regulatory strategy  we announced on april   that randomization of at least patients in the people s republic of china prc  a requirement for registrational filing in the prc  had been completed 
the heat study had already enrolled a sufficient number to support registrational filings in south korea and taiwan  two important markets for thermodox 
the future of these activities will be part of our strategic planning as we analyze the data announced on january  and will affect our partnership with hisun described below 
on may   we entered into a long term commercial supply agreement with hisun for the production of thermodox in the mainland china  hong kong and macau the china territory 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  hisun will be responsible for providing all of the technical and regulatory support services  including the costs of all technical transfer  registrational and bioequivalence studies  technical transfer costs  celsion consultative support costs and the purchase of any necessary equipment and additional facility costs necessary to support capacity requirements for the manufacture of thermodox 
we will repay hisun for the aggregate amount of these development costs and fees commencing on the successful completion of three registrational batches of thermodox 
the batches are expected to be successfully produced in mid  and repayment of the development costs will occur at any time on or prior to the fourth year anniversary of the signing of the agreement  which we expect in total to be approximately million 
hisun is also obligated to certain performance requirements under the agreement 
the agreement is initially limited to a percentage of the production requirements of thermodox in the china territory with hisun retaining an option for additional global supply after local regulatory approval in the china territory 
in addition  hisun will collaborate with us in relation to the regulatory approval activities for thermodox with the china state food and drug administration sfda 
on january   we broadened our relationship with hisun by entering into a technology development contract with hisun  pursuant to which hisun paid us a non refundable research and development fee of million to support our development of thermodox and we will provide research data and other technical support in relation to a regulatory filing by hisun with the sfda for approval of thermodox for manufacturing and sale in the china territory 
on january   we also entered into an exclusive option agreement with hisun  terminable at any time by hisun  under which we granted hisun an option to enter into an exclusive license agreement with us for the manufacturing and commercialization of thermodox with respect to all indications in the china territory under the terms and conditions set forth in the exclusive option agreement and other customary terms and conditions to be set forth in the license agreement  if any 
hisun agreed to pay us an additional million within sixty days after the signing of the exclusive option agreement if it has not been terminated within such time period 
the exclusive option agreement contemplated payments of an upfront license fee  milestone payments and royalties to celsion if the exclusive license agreement were entered into 
following our announcement on january  that thermodox in combination with radiofrequency ablation did not meet the primary endpoint of the phase iii clinical trial for primary liver cancer  hisun has elected to terminate the exclusive option agreement and not to pursue the option to enter into an exclusive license agreement with us for the china territory  which termination took effect as of february  as a result of the termination  we will not receive the additional million payment or any future payment originally contemplated by the exclusive option agreement 
the technology development contract will remain in effect while we and hisun continue to collaborate and are evaluating next steps in relation to thermodox  which include the sub group analysis of the chinese cohort of patients in the heat study and other activities to further the development of thermodox for the china territory 
thermodox in relation to cancers other than primary liver cancer in  we formed a joint research agreement with philips healthcare  a division of royal philips electronics  to evaluate the combination of philips high intensity focused ultrasound hifu with thermodox to determine the potential of this combination to treat a broad range of cancers 
as a result of our progress to clinical development status  we are currently negotiating a new agreement with philips 
in august  we announced fda clearance to commence a phase ii study of thermodox and philip s sonalleve mr guided hifu technology for the palliation of painful metastases to the bone caused by lung  prostate or breast cancers 
in june  we announced a collaboration with the university of oxford to begin a clinical study of thermodox plus hifu in the treatment of metastatic liver cancer 
the trial  which is supported by the national institute for health research oxford biomedical research centre  will be carried out as a multidisciplinary collaboration between us  the oxford university institute of biomedical engineering and the oxford university hospitals nhs trust 
this early phase clinical study is being finalized and will require approval from a local ethics committee 
treatment of the first patient is targeted for the first half of we are also working with the focused ultrasound foundation in preclinical studies designed to explore the use of thermodox in combination with mr guided hifu for the treatment of pancreatic cancer 
the studies are being conducted at the university of washington uw school of medicine 
the uw research is expected to include animal models to confirm the ability of hifu to target high concentrations of doxorubicin in proprietary pancreatic cancer cell lines and in vivo studies to assess the response to these tumors treated using thermodox with and without hifu induced hyperthermia 
we believe that these collaborations are just the beginning for combining important device technologies such as hifu with our low heat activated liposomal technology 
in addition to the collaborations outlined above  we have two ongoing clinical studies a phase ii study of thermodox in combination with rfa for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases the ablate study and a phase ii study of thermodox in combination with hyperthermia for the treatment of recurrent chest wall rcw breast cancer the dignity study 
the primary study endpoint for the ablate study is based on one year local tumor recurrence  with secondary endpoints of time to progression and overall survival 
the dignity study has opened for enrollment with the activation of three clinical sites 
the primary study endpoint of the dignity study is bioequivalence of the drug supplied by our second us manufacturing site  with the secondary endpoint of tumor response based on recist criteria 
the continuation of these studies will be subject to a detailed analysis of the data from the heat study to assess the future strategic value of our product pipeline and research and development priorities

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements  which appear at item to this annual report on form k  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require that we make certain assumptions and estimates and  in connection therewith  adopt certain accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are set forth in note to our financial statements 
of those policies  we believe that the policies discussed below may involve a higher degree of judgment and may be more critical to an accurate reflection of our financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of asc topic compensation which requires the expense recognition over a service period for the fair value of share based compensation awards  such as stock options  restricted stock and performance based shares 
this standard allows us to establish modeling assumptions as to expected stock price volatility  option terms  forfeiture and dividend rates  which directly impact estimated fair value as determined 
our practice is to utilize reasonable and supportable assumptions which are reviewed with our board of directors and its appropriate committee 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies on an ongoing basis to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosure system provides accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
as part of the process  the company reviews the selection  application and communication of critical accounting policies and financial disclosures 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period

research and development expenses research and development r d expenses decreased to million in compared to million in costs associated with our phase iii heat study decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily the result of reaching enrollment targets for this pivotal study in the second quarter of costs associated with our recurrent chest wall breast cancer clinical trial rcw remained relatively unchanged at million in and costs associated with the company s crlm trial were million in compared to million in other clinical related expenses decreased slightly to million in compared to million in preclinical costs increased slightly to million in compared to million in costs associated with regulatory activities increased to million in compared to million in as the company prepared for a potential submission of a new drug application nda in the event of positive data from the heat study 
costs associated with the production of thermodox decreased to million in compared to million in primarily due to the timing of registration batches and ongoing development of manufacturing capabilities for thermodox 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in this increase is largely the result of an increase in professional fees related to product market analysis  business development activities  and personnel costs in compared to change in common stock warrant liability a common stock warrant liability was incurred as a result of warrants issued in a public offering in september this liability is calculated at its fair market value using the black scholes option pricing model and is adjusted at the end of each quarter

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by an immaterial amount 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and or money market funds that invest in such securities 
we have no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments 
as of december   our investments consisted of investments in corporate notes and obligations or in money market accounts and checking funds with variable market rates of interest 
we believe our credit risk is immaterial
