item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report  that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results 
part i item business overview we are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing antibiotics to meet critical medical needs in the treatment of infectious diseases  particularly respiratory tract infections and chronic staphylococcal infections 
our lead program is solithromycin cem  which we are developing in both oral and intravenous  or iv  formulations initially for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia  or cabp  one of the most serious infections of the respiratory tract 
we have completed a successful phase clinical trial of the oral formulation for the treatment of cabp  demonstrating a favorable safety and tolerability profile and comparable efficacy to the current standard of care  levofloxacin  a respiratory fluoroquinolone 
in december  we initiated a pivotal phase trial for oral solithromycin in patients with cabp 
we are also pursuing a second indication  bacterial urethritis  primarily gonorrhea  for which there is an urgent public health need 
in this indication  in october we released data from a phase study in which solithromycin was demonstrated to be highly effective in treating uncomplicated gonorrhea 
our second program is taksta  an antibiotic known as fusidic acid  that has been used for decades outside the us  including western europe 
we are developing taksta in the us as an oral treatment for long term treatment of prosthetic joint infections caused by staphylococci  including s 
aureus and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  or mrsa 
taksta successfully completed a phase clinical trial in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections  or absssi  which is frequently caused by mrsa  demonstrating a favorable safety and tolerability profile and comparable efficacy to linezolid sold under the brand name zyvox  the only oral antibiotic for the treatment of mrsa approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
having shown that taksta is well tolerated and is active against current strains of mrsa in the us  in december  we initiated a phase trial with taksta in patients with prosthetic joint infections which is also primarily caused by staphylococci and for which safe  oral antibiotics for long term use are not currently available 
we have global rights other than the association of south east asian nations  or asean  countries  which are brunei darussalam  cambodia  indonesia  laos  malaysia  myanmar burma  the philippines  singapore  thailand and vietnam to solithromycin and are developing taksta exclusively for the us market 
our goal is to develop differentiated antibiotics 
we believe there are two main challenges that antibiotic candidates must overcome to be considered truly differentiated from currently available antibiotics and those in development 
the first is spectrum of activity 
in addition to having activity against bacteria that have become resistant to generic antibiotics  one should focus on the right spectrum rather than broad spectrum 
the right spectrum means an antibiotic that is active against most or all of the pathogens that are involved in a particular infection and could reduce the need for polytherapy 
it also means that collateral damage to important bacteria such as gut flora is limited so that unintended side effects do not occur 
we believe that solithromycin fits this profile as it is active against many key cabp pathogens as well as against pneumococcal strains resistant to other macrolides 
the second is that there are many generic antibiotics 
to compete effectively  each of our products will have to be sufficiently differentiated  based on efficacy  safety  dosing flexibility  and or other factors  from competing products to enable it to address a meaningful market 
solithromycin cem solithromycin is a potent new macrolide that we are developing in oral and iv formulations for the treatment of respiratory tract infections  including cabp  which is one of the most common serious infectious diseases of the respiratory tract  and bacterial urethritis  including gonorrhea  the second most common infectious disease in the world 
historically  macrolides  including azithromycin  have been among the most frequently prescribed drugs for respiratory tract infections because of their combination of spectrum of antibacterial activity  safety for use in adult and pediatric patients  availability in oral and iv formulations  and strong anti inflammatory properties 
spectrum of activity refers to the antibiotic s ability to protect against a range of bacterial types 
the effectiveness of macrolides for treating serious respiratory tract infections such as cabp  however  has declined due to resistance issues related to earlier generations of macrolides 
macrolide use for serious infections has generally been replaced by fluoroquinolones  including levofloxacin  despite this class having a less desirable safety and tolerability profile than macrolides 
solithromycin is being developed for moderate to moderately severe cabp 
we are also developing solithromycin as a treatment for bacterial urethritis  including gonorrhea 
as with respiratory tract pathogens  neisseria gonorrheae  has become resistant to macrolides  including azithromycin and other classes of antibiotics 
we believe solithromycin  with its unique chemical structure  retains and improves on the beneficial features of macrolides and can overcome the shortcomings of existing therapies 
our phase and phase clinical trials and pre clinical studies to date have shown that solithromycin has the following attributes favorable safety and tolerability profile  comparable efficacy to the current standard of care  potent activity against a broad range of bacteria with excellent tissue distribution and intracellular activity  lower incidence of resistance development  potential for iv  oral and suspension formulations that may allow it to be used in broad patient populations and settings  potential for pediatric development  and 
table of contents anti inflammatory qualities to help patients feel better sooner during treatment 
in the third quarter of  we completed a successful phase clinical trial in cabp patients comparing the oral formulation of solithromycin to levofloxacin  a respiratory fluoroquinolone which is the current standard of care 
in this trial  solithromycin demonstrated efficacy comparable to levofloxacin and a favorable safety and tolerability profile  with a lower incidence of treatment emergent adverse events than levofloxacin 
we designed our pivotal phase trial for oral solithromycin to treat cabp based on comments we received from the fda 
we believe that we will need two phase trials to support our planned nda for solithromycin to treat cabp one trial with oral solithromycin and another trial with iv solithromycin stepping down to oral solithromycin 
these trials will be randomized  double blinded studies conducted against a respiratory fluoroquinolone  moxifloxacin avelox  for which we will have to show non inferiority for efficacy and acceptable safety and tolerability 
non inferiority for efficacy means solithromycin will have to prove it is statistically as effective as a comparator drug within a pre defined margin 
in  the fda clarified the guidance for the clinical development of therapies for the treatment of cabp 
we have designed our phase trials to meet fda guidelines 
the fda reviewed and provided comments on our oral phase trial protocol and we began the phase trial with oral solithromycin in december in october  we reported results from our phase trial for the iv formulation of solithromycin in which we demonstrated that iv solithromycin demonstrated good systemic tolerability  showed a favorable pharmacokinetic pk profile and achieved relevant plasma concentrations 
based on this study  we have selected a therapeutic dose of mg administered once daily for up to seven days for the phase iv to oral step down trial 
we plan to finalize the overall development program for solithromycin for cabp with the fda at our end of phase meeting for solithromycin  which we expect will occur in the first half of and to initiate the iv to oral trial in the second half of  subject to available resources 
in addition  we are studying solithromycin for the treatment of bacterial urethritis  including uncomplicated gonorrhea 
the current standard of treatment for gonorrhea is a single intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone 
until recently  cefixime suprax had been recommended for oral treatment of patients as well as for treatment of their potentially infected partners 
however  as of august  the centers for disease control  or cdc  no longer recommends cefixime for the treatment of gonorrhea  which leaves no oral treatment option 
in our preclinical studies  solithromycin has demonstrated in vitro activity against most drug resistant gonococcal bacteria 
in our phase open label study begun in june and that  as of the date of this report  has enrolled patients with suspected gonococcal infection  a single oral dose of solithromycin was administered 
in october  we reported that the primary endpoint of bacterial eradication as measured by conversion from positive baseline urethral or cervical cultures to negative at seven days was achieved in of evaluable patients patients with positive baseline cultures 
pharyngeal and rectal gonococcal infections were also cleared in this study 
because this is a second indication for which we intend to seek regulatory approval  we anticipate that a single phase trial in bacterial urethritis cervicitis primarily gonorrhea  will be sufficient for fda approval for this indication 
taksta taksta is an oral therapy that we are developing in the us for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections  which are frequently caused by staphylococci  including s 
aureus  mrsa  coagulase negative staphylococci and other gram positive bacteria 
taksta is a novel and proprietary dosing regimen of fusidic acid  which is an approved antibiotic that has been sold by leo laboratories  ltd 
primarily for staphylococcal infections  including skin  soft tissue and bone infections  for several decades in europe and other countries outside the us and has a long established safety and efficacy profile 
we believe taksta has the potential to be used in hospital and community settings on both a short term and chronic basis 
since prosthetic joint infection is primarily treated with a combination of iv and oral drugs  we believe that taksta would enable out patient treatment of many patients who would otherwise require hospitalization  which we also believe would provide pharmacoeconomic advantages  be well received by doctors and be more convenient for patients 
we have filed a patent application for our proprietary dosing regimen which has been shown with pharmacodynamics experiments to limit resistance development 
in addition  fusidic acid is eligible for market exclusivity under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act  also known as the hatch waxman act 
if approved for prosthetic joint infections  taksta could be eligible for orphan drug status in the us  which would provide seven years of market exclusivity 
taksta would also be eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity based upon the generating incentives for antibiotics now  or gain act  since mrsa is listed in the law as a qualified infectious disease pathogen 
therefore  taksta could qualify for as much as years of exclusivity in total 
taksta also could receive additional six months exclusivity if approved for pediatric indications 
according to a survey of physicians conducted by decision resources  mrsa is the most important pathogen of concern in patients with osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infection 
bone infections often begin with skin infections where bacteria enter the bloodstream through breaks in the skin or mucous membrane that occur as a result of a wound or due to a surgical  medical or dental procedure 

table of contents our clinical trials and pre clinical studies to date  as well as historical data from outside the us  have shown that taksta has the following attributes established safety profile  comparable efficacy to the only fda approved oral treatment for mrsa  ability to be used orally as a treatment for all types of s 
aureus  including mrsa  lower frequency of resistance development due to our loading dose regimen  and potential to be used in patient populations not well served by current treatments 
in  we successfully completed a phase clinical trial with taksta in absssi patients 
in this trial  the taksta loading dose regimen demonstrated efficacy  safety and tolerability that was comparable to linezolid 
like absssi  prosthetic joint infections are often caused by s 
aureus  including mrsa 
in december  we initiated a phase trial of taksta in patients with prosthetic joint infections 
the limitations associated with antibiotics the widespread use of antibiotics has led to development of resistant strains of bacteria  which limits the effectiveness of existing drugs 
this led the world health organization to state in that antibiotic resistance is one of the three greatest threats to human health 
the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that more than of us hospital infections are resistant to at least one of the antibiotics most commonly used to treat them 
antibiotic resistance is primarily caused by genetic mutations in bacteria selected by exposure to antibiotics where the drug does not kill all of the bacteria 
in addition to mutated bacteria being resistant to the drug used for treatment  many bacterial strains can also be cross resistant  meaning that the use of a particular treatment to address one kind of bacteria can result in resistance to other kinds of bacteria as well as to other antibiotics 
as a result  the effectiveness of many antibiotics has declined  limiting physicians options to treat serious infections and creating a global health issue 
for example  it is estimated that in the us of pneumococci  the primary pathogen involved in respiratory tract infections  are resistant to azithromycin and other macrolides commonly used to treat them 
antibiotic resistance has a significant impact on mortality and contributes heavily to health care system costs worldwide 
in addition to resistance issues  current antibiotic therapies also have other limitations  including serious side effects 
these side effects may include severe allergic reaction  decreased blood pressure  nausea and vomiting  suppression of platelets  pain and inflammation at the site of injection  muscle  renal and oto toxicities  optic and peripheral neuropathies and headaches 
some of these side effects may be significant enough to require that therapy be discontinued or not used 
as a result  some treatments require clinicians to closely monitor patients blood levels and other parameters  increasing the expense and inconvenience of treatment 
further  many of the existing antibiotics used to treat serious infections are difficult or inconvenient to administer 
many drugs are given twice daily for seven to days or more and patients can be hospitalized for much or all of this period or require in home iv therapy 
while iv treatment delivers the drug more rapidly and in a larger dose than is possible orally  once a patient is stabilized  a step down to oral treatment allows for more convenient and cost effective out patient treatment 
we believe that there is a need for new antibiotics that have improved potency and pharmacokinetics  effectiveness against resistant bacterial strains  improved side effect profiles and more flexible administration formulations 
the fda has issued proposed guidelines for cabp that impact the development of new antibiotics by recommending certain protocol elements  measures and endpoints for clinical trials 
recent public fda discussions have evolved toward requiring that new drugs demonstrate non inferiority to the current standard of care for the disease to be treated  within a predetermined non inferiority margin 
we believe the fda guidance is helpful in clarifying the regulatory pathway for our product candidates and  given the data that we have gathered to date on our product candidates  reinforces our belief that our product candidates can establish non inferiority while also demonstrating efficacy against susceptible and resistant bacterial strains and improved safety 
our clinical trials for solithromycin have been designed with these guidelines in mind 
solithromycin overview we are developing solithromycin  a fourth generation macrolide  to treat respiratory tract infections  including cabp and also for treating bacterial urethritis 
traditionally  macrolides have been among the most commonly prescribed drug for respiratory tract infections because of their combination of spectrum of activity  safety for use in adult and pediatric patients  tissue distribution and activity against intracellular pathogens  pharmacokinetics allowing use in oral and iv formulations  and anti inflammatory properties 
however  the effectiveness of macrolides for treating serious respiratory tract infections such as cabp has declined due to resistance issues related to earlier generations of macrolides 
we believe our clinical and pre clinical results suggest that solithromycin retains and improves on the benefits of  and overcomes the shortcomings of  earlier generation macrolides 

table of contents solithromycin market opportunity we are developing solithromycin in both oral and iv formulations initially as a treatment for cabp  which is a respiratory tract bacterial infection acquired outside of a hospital setting 
respiratory tract infections can range from severe diseases such as pneumonia cabp  to similar infections of the respiratory tract such as pharyngitis which is usually referred to as strep throat  bronchitis  chronic sinusitis and middle ear infections which are especially common in children 
cabp is one of the most common serious infectious diseases of the respiratory tract and is the most frequent cause of death due to bacterial infections 
there are million fatal cases of pneumococcal disease annually worldwide which is more than the deaths caused annually by breast or prostate cancer 
there are approximately five to six million cases of cabp in the us every year  approximately one million of which require hospitalization 
typical bacteria that cause cabp include streptococcus pneumoniae  haemophilus influenzae  and moraxella catarrhalis 
these three bacteria account for approximately of cabp cases 
other organisms may be involved in cabp and include legionella pneumophila  s 
aureus  chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneuomoniae 
many respiratory tract infections  including cabp  involve multiple bacteria 
the routine diagnostic tests available to a physician can only identify a pathogen in to of cases and that diagnosis can take several days 
since infections can be serious and potentially life threatening  physicians cannot delay treatment while waiting for the results of these diagnostic tests to identify the pathogens involved in the disease 
as a result  physicians seek to begin treatment with the antibiotic or combination of antibiotics that has the broadest activity against the bacteria thought to be causing the infection 
cabp and other respiratory tract infections can be treated with numerous classes of antibiotics  including macrolides  tetracyclines  fluoroquinolones  penicillins and cephalosporins 
each class has a different mechanism of action and resulting spectrum of activity 
each class  however  whether used alone or in combination  has limitations that can impede the treatment of cabp infections 
historically  macrolides have been among the most commonly prescribed drug for respiratory tract infections because of their broad spectrum of activity and relative safety 
azithromycin  a second generation macrolide which is sold as zithromax and z pak and as a generic  is the most widely prescribed macrolide with total us prescriptions of million in  according to ims health  and sales of billion  according to medical marketing media 
in recent years  the effectiveness of earlier generation macrolides  including azithromycin  to treat serious infections such as cabp has declined due to resistance issues 
the most recently approved macrolide  telithromycin ketek  has seen limited use because of serious side effects 
for these reasons  fluoroquinolones  such as levofloxacin  now are commonly used for serious cabp infections 
although levofloxacin is efficacious  it has serious side effects including c 
difficile enterocolitis  tendonitis  hepatotoxicity and central nervous system effects 
beta lactams  such as cephalosporins  which are commonly used in cabp  also have limitations  including limited coverage against several important bacteria such as legionella and mycoplasma 
in addition  the newer cephalosporins can only be administered intravenously  which is a disadvantage if the patient does not need to be hospitalized or needs step down oral therapy to enable treatment on an out patient basis 
the american thoracic society  or ats  and the infectious diseases society of america  or idsa  recommend a macrolide together with a beta lactam such as a cephalosporin to treat cabp 
alternatively  ats and idsa recommend physicians treat cabp with fluoroquinolones 
the recommended combination of a macrolide with a beta lactam has been shown to enhance survival  when a macrolide is not used  an increase in mortality has been shown 
we believe that the initial market acceptance of ketek  which  according to ims health  in  its first full year after fda approval  generated million prescriptions and million in sales in the us  demonstrates the potential for a new macrolide therapy 
however  soon after its us approval in  ketek was found to cause reversible visual disturbances  loss of consciousness  exacerbate myasthenia gravis a neurological disorder characterized by improper muscle regulation and cause liver toxicity resulting in liver failure 
ketek was withdrawn in for use in all infections other than cabp  and as a result  the large market predicted for ketek has not developed 
while ketek is a macrolide  solithromycin has a different chemical structure from ketek  and therefore we believe is not likely to have the safety issues associated with ketek 
our research  which was published in a peer reviewed article in antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy  suggests that pyridine  a chemical component of ketek  is the agent that causes liver toxicity and other problems associated with ketek 
solithromycin and older generation macrolides  including azithromycin and clarithromycin  do not have a pyridine component and have not been observed to cause the serious side effects associated with ketek 
we believe that solithromycin has the potential to be more successful than ketek if our phase trials confirm the efficacy and safety profile demonstrated in our previous trials 
as a result of the limitations of current therapies for cabp  we believe there is an opportunity to introduce a next generation macrolide that is more potent and effective against bacteria that are resistant to older generations of macrolides  while retaining the traditional safety and anti inflammatory properties that macrolides are known to exhibit 
to date  our phase and phase clinical trials have demonstrated that solithromycin is potent and effective against resistant bacteria and is well tolerated  with no serious adverse events 
we also believe that developing iv and oral formulations will provide flexibility to physicians to treat patients according to the severity of their disease and transition some patients from iv to oral  enabling them to leave the hospital sooner 
if approved by the fda  solithromycin would be the first macrolide approved with both iv and oral formulations since azithromycin was approved years ago 

table of contents in addition to cabp  there is a large public health need for a new and effective oral treatment for treating bacterial urethritis 
resistance has emerged to cefixime  which is the only remaining oral therapy for gonococci infections  such as bacterial urethritis 
our preclinical data suggests that solithromycin is active against most bacterial pathogens known to be involved in bacterial urethritis including gonococci  chlamydia and mycoplasma 
the cdc and key opinion leaders have expressed the need for an oral antibiotic as a replacement for cefixime because of resistance development 
the development of solithromycin for bacterial urethritis would present an additional market opportunity for solithromycin and all of the patient data gathered in any trials would also contribute to the safety data base for cabp development 
key attributes of solithromycin we believe the following key attributes of solithromycin will make it a safe and effective treatment for cabp and bacterial urethritis 
solithromycin has demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile 
solithromycin has been tested in over subjects in our phase and clinical trials and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated to date 
there were no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities in the phase trials 
in the phase trial  there were fewer adverse events compared to levofloxacin  none of which required the patient to prematurely discontinue treatment with solithromycin  and no serious adverse events determined by the investigator to be related to solithromycin 
patients in our single and multi dose phase iv trial showed no clinically significant liver enzyme changes associated with solithromycin at the selected therapeutic doses  indicating no liver toxicity 
additionally  in this study solithromycin did not produce dose limiting nausea or vomiting  or effect the heart  which are common side effects of other macrolides 
solithromycin has demonstrated comparable efficacy to the current standard of care 
in our phase trial in cabp patients comparing the oral formulation of solithromycin to levofloxacin  solithromycin successfully demonstrated efficacy comparable to levofloxacin 
in addition  solithromycin has been highly effective in a phase trial of bacterial urethritis 
solithromycin is potent against a broad range of bacteria and has excellent tissue distribution and intracellular activity 
in pre clinical studies  solithromycin was shown to be generally eight to times more potent against respiratory tract bacteria in vitro than azithromycin as well as retains activity against azithromycin resistant strains 
these pre clinical studies also showed that solithromycin is potent against many bacteria that are resistant to levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones 
in addition to respiratory tract infections  solithromycin is active against bacteria causing other types of infections such as urethritis  malaria  and tuberculosis 
solithromycin has demonstrated activity against bacterial strains that are not susceptible to older generations of macrolides 
in pre clinical studies  solithromycin has demonstrated a longer post antibiotic effect  meaning that after exposure to solithromycin  bacteria take longer to regrow than after exposure to other macrolides  supporting the potential for once daily dosing 
solithromycin has also demonstrated excellent organ and tissue distribution and intracellular activity  addressing not only bacteria located in the blood but also in organs and cells in which they multiply 
bacteria therefore cannot escape from the action of the drug 
as a result of its potency  spectrum of activity and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties  we believe that solithromycin could eventually be used as a monotherapy for the treatment of cabp 
solithromycin has a greater ability to fight resistant bacteria and to overcome resistance development due to its chemical structure 
solithromycin has a unique structure that binds to bacterial ribosomes in three sites while earlier generation macrolides have only one or two binding sites 
therefore  bacteria must mutate at three sites on the ribosome to become resistant to solithromycin 
to date  we have seen no resistance to solithromycin in our clinical trials  and resistance was rare in our pre clinical studies 
solithromycin has the potential for iv  oral and suspension formulations 
we are developing oral and iv formulations to allow patients with severe cabp to be treated in both hospital and out patient settings 
providing both the iv and oral formulations will enable iv to oral step down therapy 
we believe this would be more convenient and cost effective for patients and provide pharmacoeconomic advantages to health care systems 
we intend to develop a suspension formulation for treating bacterial infections in the pediatric population 
solithromycin has improved anti inflammatory qualities 
in cabp and other bacterial infections  the body s immune response to the bacteria results in inflammation and tissue damage  which worsens symptoms 
in addition to their antibacterial effects  macrolides also have anti inflammatory properties which help patients feel better earlier 
our pre clinical data suggest that solithromycin could have significantly greater anti inflammatory properties than azithromycin and clarithromycin  which are used to treat patients with cystic fibrosis  or cf  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd  primarily for their anti inflammatory properties 
clinical data phase oral trial 
we successfully completed a phase trial of the oral formulation of solithromycin in the third quarter of the trial was a randomized  double blinded  multi center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral solithromycin 
table of contents compared to oral levofloxacin in patients with cabp 
levofloxacin  which is a respiratory fluoroquinolone  is the current standard of care and widely prescribed for the treatment of cabp 
patients were randomized to receive solithromycin or levofloxacin for five days 
solithromycin patients received once daily dosing of mg on day and mg on days through patients randomized to levofloxacin treatment received the standard dosing regimen of mg per day for five days 
the trial compared clinical success rates and safety and tolerability parameters for solithromycin and levofloxacin 
the primary outcome measure was continued improvement or complete resolution of baseline signs and symptoms in the intent to treat  or itt  and the clinically evaluable  or ce  populations at the test of cure  or toc  visit  which was completed five to days after the last dose of the drug 
outcomes were assessed for several populations within the study 
the itt population consisted of all randomized patients  among whom were in the ce group 
to be clinically evaluable  key inclusion and exclusion criteria had to be validated  confounding antibiotics for other infections could not have been administered  and key visits and assessments had to have been performed 
patients for whom a microbial pathogen  or the bacteria responsible for the pneumonia  had been identified comprised the microbial itt  or mitt  population 
those mitt patients who were also in the ce study group constituted the microbial evaluable or me group 
since pneumonia can also be caused by viruses which antibiotics cannot treat  the fda has placed emphasis on proof of clinical success in the mitt and me groups 
solithromycin demonstrated comparable efficacy to levofloxacin 
the clinical response rate in the itt population was for solithromycin and for levofloxacin 
similarly  clinical response rates for solithromycin and levofloxacin in the mitt and me populations were well balanced vs 
and vs 
 respectively 
the clinical response rates at toc for the itt  ce  mitt and me populations are presented in table table solithromycin oral phase results clinical response at test of cure days to after last dose 
population clinical response solithromycin mg once daily no 
of patients levofloxacin mg once daily no 
of patients itt number of patients success confidence interval failure failure indeterminate ce number of patients success confidence interval failure mitt number of patients success confidence interval failure failure indeterminate me number of patients success confidence interval failure includes clinical response of failure and indeterminate 
in the ce population  the numerical success rate was higher in the levofloxacin arm  with broadly overlapping confidence intervals 
this in large part is due to exclusion of a larger number of failure patients from the levofloxacin arm and exclusion of treatment successes from the solithromycin arm on the basis of pre established study criteria including validation of key inclusion and exclusion criteria and the completion of key visits and assessments 
under the proposed fda guidance for the conduct of cabp clinical trials  drug developers will be required to assess early responses to therapy as a primary endpoint 
therefore  we assessed markers of clinical success at the day visit 
a clinical response was achieved if a patient was clinically stable and had experienced an improvement in severity without worsening in any of these signs or symptoms 
the early clinical response rate in the itt population was for solithromycin patients  and for levofloxacin patients 

table of contents safety was an important focus of this phase trial 
in the trial  patients receiving levofloxacin reported more adverse events and severe adverse events than solithromycin patients 
there were patients in the solithromycin group with treatment emergent adverse events  or teae  compared with patients in the levofloxacin group 
there were no patients in the solithromycin group that discontinued the study due to a teae as compared to six patients in the levofloxacin group 
the overall incidence of teae was greater in the levofloxacin arm  at all degrees of severity 
notably  gastrointestinal disorders  including abdominal discomfort  nausea  and vomiting  all occurred with greater frequency among levofloxacin recipients 
the results are summarized in table below 
table solithromycin oral phase results treatment emergent adverse events with incidence in any treatment group 
by system organ solithromycin mg once daily no 
of patients  n levofloxacin mg once daily no 
of patients  n mild n moderate n severe n mild n moderate n severe n subjects with at least one teae gastrointestinal disorders musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders nervous system disorders in addition to teaes  the trial also recorded serious adverse events  which are adverse events of particular severity that  among other defining criteria  might result in hospitalization or threaten overall health or survival 
there were nine patients who experienced one or more serious adverse events during the study  two solithromycin recipients and seven levofloxacin recipients 
the study site trial investigator determined that both of the serious adverse events reported in solithromycin recipients were unrelated to solithromycin  while one of the seven reported in levofloxacin recipients was unrelated to levofloxacin 
patients treated with solithromycin had no drug related clinically significant liver toxicities and reported no visual adverse events 
severe liver toxicities and visual disturbances led the fda to require the drug label for ketek to include a strengthened warning section regarding specific drug related adverse events and contributed to ketek being withdrawn for the treatment of all infections other than cabp 
phase iv trial 
the objective of our phase iv trial for solithromycin was to demonstrate safety and tolerability as well as to select the therapeutic dose after iv administration for our planned second phase  iv to oral step down trial 
we tested escalating iv doses of mg  mg  mg  mg  mg  mg and mg administered as single doses or   and mg doses administered once daily for seven days 
patients were randomized into solithromycin and placebo arms 
in the trial  the most common adverse events  or aes  were general disorders and administration site conditions related to infusion discomfort or pain 
our phase trial also tested infusion solutions designed to minimize injection site pain 
no aes were reported in any of the studies that resulted from clinically significant changes in physical examinations  vital signs  or ecg data 
in healthy subjects who received repeat dose iv solithromycin   or mg qd for up to seven days in the phase study had asymptomatic and reversible alt elevations 
one subject  who received three daily doses of mg  had a reversible and asymptomatic grade alt elevation without bilirubin elevation 
these alt elevations were reversible and not associated with symptoms  bilirubin elevation or cholestasis 
no loss of consciousness  myasthenia exacerbations  or visual disturbances were observed 
among patients receiving repeated doses of mg daily for up to seven days  no clinically significant systemic adverse events were observed  except injection site pain in some subjects 
in addition  the desired pk profile was achieved  with clinically relevant mean peak solithromycin concentrations of micrograms ml 
modeling of the pk data suggest that initial intravenous dosing with mg once daily  with a switch to oral administration when clinically appropriate to the same dose as in the oral program  ie mg loading dose and mg maintenance dose  will achieve concentrations of the drug that warrant its evaluation in the treatment of moderate to severe community acquired bacterial pneumonia caused by pathogens including azithromycin resistant pneumococcus  legionella  mycoplasma  moraxella  hemophilus influenzae  and staphylococcus aureus  including methicillin susceptible and community acquired methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  all of which are infections that could require elevated concentrations of antibiotics 
based on this study  we have selected a therapeutic dose of mg administered once daily for up to seven days for our planned phase iv to oral step down trial with the option of stepping down to oral treatment of solithromycin when appropriate as decided by the physician based on decreased symptoms 
phase oral trials 
in earlier phase oral trials beginning in and continuing into  subjects were exposed to solithromycin 
the phase trials were designed to examine the safety of solithromycin and the properties of the drug when absorbed 
table of contents into the bloodstream 
there were no clinically relevant changes in patient laboratory values  including liver enzymes 
there were very limited gastrointestinal adverse events and no dose limiting nausea or vomiting  a common side effect of macrolides 
absorption of solithromycin into the bloodstream after oral administration was not affected by food  meaning solithromycin may be taken with or without food 
the results from our first phase dose escalation study demonstrated that doses of solithromycin from mg to mg had a favorable safety profile and were well tolerated in healthy subjects and that the compound s pharmacokinetic profile was supportive of once daily dosing 
in this study  solithromycin was administered orally once daily for seven days at mg  mg and mg 
the bioavailability of solithromycin was calculated to be whereas azithromycin s bioavailability is as reported in its package insert 
the concentration of solithromycin was measured in the plasma on day and day the compound showed moderate accumulation over the seven days of dosing  indicating that a loading dose regimen followed by a maintenance dose would be suitable  as has been noted with macrolides like azithromycin in the past 
these blood levels were subjected to a sophisticated computer model based on efficacy studies in mouse models  which led to identifying a loading dose of mg with a maintenance dose of mg as the therapeutic dose 
at these doses solithromycin is expected to be clinically effective against of pneumococci with a minimum inhibitory concentration  or mic  of g ml or less  while no pneumococcal strains with an mic of mcg ml have been identified in any of the surveillance programs 
mild  clinically insignificant gastrointestinal side effects were the most common adverse events observed in each dose group 
importantly  there were no clinically significant adverse events 
in cabp  the lung is the target organ where pathogens replicate 
therefore  in the first quarter of  we conducted a phase pharmacokinetic study of solithromycin in healthy human volunteers to measure the concentration of solithromycin in the epithelial lining fluid  or elf  and in alveolar macrophages  or am  compared to the concentration in plasma 
after five days of dosing mg per day  without loading  we performed bronchoalveolar lavage bal  a medical procedure to collect fluid and cells in the lung 
bal analysis was performed in groups of six at    or hours following the last solithromycin dose on day  and solithromycin concentrations were measured in each of the elf  am  and plasma 
the concentration of solithromycin in elf was times that of plasma and in am it was times that of plasma 
as shown in table  solithromycin s drug levels are higher than those achieved by azithromycin and solithromycin reaches the site of infection at concentration levels several fold in excess of the levels necessary to kill the relevant bacteria according to our pre clinical studies 
higher drug levels also inhibit bacterial regrowth and resistance development during intervals between dosages

al  we also conducted three drug drug interaction studies in and in which solithromycin was co administered with rifampin  midazolam or ketoconazole to test its effects on these drugs 
these studies have been successfully concluded and the data confirm that solithromycin s interactions with cypa  an enzyme in the liver that metabolizes a number of drugs  are consistent with older macrolides interactions with cypa phase trial in gonorrhea 
emerging resistance to available therapies  including oral and injectible cephalosporins and azithromycin  has resulted in an urgent medical need for new therapies for gonorrhea 
solithromycin  a new fourth generation macrolide with three ribosomal binding sites  has greater in vitro potency against gonococci than azithromycin and is active against most azithromycin and cephalosporin resistant strains 
we have completed a phase ii study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single dose oral solithromycin for treatment of patients with gonorrhea 
patients with suspected neisseria gonorrhoeae infection were enrolled 
consenting eligible patients received a single oral dose of mg solithromycin 
all patients were cultured for n 
gonorrhoeae in the urethra cervix  rectum  and pharynx at enrollment and day the primary outcome was bacterial eradication as measured by conversion from positive n 
gonorrhoeae baseline urethral or cervical culture to negative at day secondary outcomes included eradication of rectal or pharyngeal gonorrhea 
in october  we reported that gonococcal eradication rates in evaluable patients of patients enrolled at that time who had culture proven gonorrhea  were for urethral cervical infections 
eradication rates were also for rectal and pharyngeal infections 
susceptibility data from isolates show the median mic range for solithromycin was g ml 
solithromycin was generally well tolerated  with mild gastrointestinal aes common  
the most common ae was mild diarrhea  followed by mild nausea  
based on these results  a single mg dose of solithromycin appears to be well tolerated and effective in eradicating n 
gonorrhoeae 
since efficacy was achieved with mg  we are continuing to test mg to determine the optimum effective dose 

table of contents pre clinical data our pre clinical studies support four of the key attributes of solithromycin potency against a broad range of bacteria  potential to have a low incidence of resistance  intracellular activity and anti inflammatory qualities associated with macrolides 
potency 
we have extensively studied solithromycin s in vitro activity and potency against a variety of respiratory and non respiratory bacteria 
solithromycin was tested against clinical isolates including pneumococci  hemophilus  legionella  moraxella  chlamydia  neisseria  beta hemolytic streptococci  mycoplasma  s 
aureus including mrsa  coagulase negative staphylococci  enterococci and many other bacteria 
these studies found that solithromycin exhibited two to four times greater potency compared to ketek  and superior potency compared to other macrolides against most bacteria causing cabp 
in another study  solithromycin demonstrated superior activity against several serotypes of legionella pneumophila compared to other macrolides  particularly erythromycin and azithromycin  which are commonly used to treat legionellosis 
legionella are atypical bacteria and are not susceptible to penicillins and cephalosporins commonly used to treat cabp  but are susceptible to fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin 
the results of these studies are presented in table below 
potency against a panel of bacterial strains is measured by mic  which refers to the concentration needed to inhibit the growth of of a panel of bacterial strains isolated from patients 
a lower mic 
indicates greater potency against a particular bacterium

resistance 
solithromycin was tested against pneumococcal strains that have become resistant to older macrolides as a result of mutations called erm b  mef a  a combination of erm b with mef a  and l mutations 
as shown by the in vitro potency data in table below  solithromycin was active against all tested pneumococcal strains that are resistant to older macrolides

solithromycin azithromycin telithromycin clindamycin amox clav levofloxacin penicillin g the ability to become resistant to solithromycin was analyzed by exposing eight pneumococcal bacterial strains from the above study to solithromycin 
only one strain which was already resistant to the older macrolides and were erm and mef strains developed a high level resistance to solithromycin and only after passes 
this suggests that selection of resistant strains would be infrequent and additional mutations are necessary for resistance to develop to solithromycin 
we also tested a number of group a beta hemolytic streptococci that have become resistant to older macrolides 
the data indicate that solithromycin is active against these organisms  which have different mechanisms of resistance  including erm b  mef a and erm a 
the frequency of resistance was low at  but importantly there was no cross resistance with these organisms once they had become resistant to older macrolides 
solithromycin is active against all these resistant strains 
while the strains are resistant to older generations of macrolides  no strains resistant to solithromycin could be isolated after transfers in a growth medium containing solithromycin 

table of contents we have continued to study global susceptibility and resistance patterns against relevant pathogens in cabp and tested solithromycin against pathogens collected in from respiratory tract infections 
solithromycin displayed coverage against of s 
pneumoniae strains  strains collected from the us and europe at g ml a level which is achievable in the plasma and tissues 
the mic 
against s 
pneumoniae was g ml in these studies 
resistance rates in the us to macrolides have been noted to increase from previous results to in the activity of solithromycin against other respiratory tract associated pathogens  such as h 
influenzae and m 
catarrhalis  was stable during four consecutive surveillance years 
we believe this confirms that solithromycin could be a promising antibiotic for treatment of bacterial pathogens causing respiratory tract and other infections 
intracellular activity 
bacteria that cause infections can be inside cells or in tissue 
during treatment if the antibiotic does not penetrate into tissues and cells  the bacteria can escape the effect of the antibiotic 
consequently  it is important that antibiotics be distributed from the blood to the tissues and intracellularly 
macrolides have been known to be effective against intracellular bacteria  which is one of their advantages 
solithromycin accumulates to concentrations that are several times higher than azithromycin  as shown below in figure a  and the intracellular drug is potent against intracellular bacteria and is more active than azithromycin in killing intracellular pathogens such as legionella pneumophila as shown in figure b 
figure a concentration after exposure of macrophages to azithromycin and solithromycin in macrophages figure b killing of legionella located intracellularly by azithromycin and solithromycin logo anti inflammatory properties 
we conducted studies comparing solithromycin s anti inflammatory properties to older macrolides 
solithromycin was more effective than the older macrolides in decreasing the production of cytokines  which are cell signaling molecules involved in the process of inflammation 
reduction of cytokine activity would be expected to reduce inflammation and resulting tissue damage 
thus  solithromycin is expected to be effective in eradicating the infecting bacteria and reducing the inflammation resulting from the infection  which should result in a faster recovery 
older generation macrolides have also been used in the treatment of diseases like late stage copd and cf because of their anti inflammatory properties 
our pre clinical data suggest solithromycin could also be used in the treatment of these diseases 
in addition  investigators at the university of north carolina  chapel hill  through funding from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  or niaid are for studying solithromycin s mucin inhibitory properties and ability to restore lung physiology in cystic fibrosis model systems 
planned clinical trials we have initiated our pivotal trial program  which we believe will require two phase trials  including one trial with oral solithromycin and one trial with iv solithromycin stepping down to oral solithromycin for the approval of both iv and oral products under one nda 
the fda s anti infective drugs advisory committee aidac convened in november to review anticipated 
table of contents changes in guidance to the industry for conducting clinical trials for cabp 
the proposed guidance follows several fda advisory meetings as well as recommendations of an independent advisory body called the fnih that involved industry and academic infectious disease physicians 
according to the newly proposed guidelines  the primary endpoint for phase cabp trials will be clinical success at an early timepoint day post study drug initiation 
clinical success is defined as improvement in at least two of the following symptoms cough  shortness of breath  chest pain  and sputum production  without worsening in any other symptom 
the proposed guidelines also clarify the patient population required for these trials by specifying the percent of patients to be enrolled based on the severity of their disease 
for example  the new guidelines specify that up to of patients in oral cabp trials can have moderate cabp  with the remainder having more severe disease 
iv cabp trials can have up to of patients with moderate cabp while the rest must have more severe cabp 
for those seeking fda approval by establishing non inferiority  the guidance specifies that companies conduct adequate and well controlledphase cabp trials  with a requirement to demonstrate non inferiority in early clinical response rate in comparison to the comparator drug in the intent to treat population of each study  using a non inferiority margin 
in addition  non inferiority must be demonstrated in the pooled across both studies microbiological intent to treat population 
we have designed our phase trial program to meet these fda guidelines 
for our phase trial for oral solithromycin  we requested and were allowed to include mycoplasma pneumoniae  a cabp pathogen  within the mitt and me scores 
we also requested and were allowed to use pcr based rapid diagnostics for cabp pathogens curetis to support our mitt and me data 
the study was initiated in the fourth quarter of the phase trials will be randomized  double blinded studies conducted against a comparator drug agreed upon with the fda  for which we will have to show non inferiority from an efficacy perspective and acceptable safety and tolerability 
using feedback received from the fda  we began the phase trial with oral solithromycin in december we expect to receive top line data for that trial in the first half of in october  we reported results from our phase trial for the iv formulation of solithromycin in which we demonstrated that iv solithromycin was well tolerated  showed a favorable pharmacokinetic pk profile and achieved relevant plasma concentrations 
based on this study  we have selected a therapeutic dose of mg administered once daily for up to seven days for the phase iv to oral step down trial 
we are planning the second pivotal study  a phase iv to oral step down study for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe cabp 
we plan to request  in the first quarter of an end of phase meeting with the fda 
this is a key meeting that should define the expectations for the nda for the iv and oral formulations of solithromycin 
the fda can take up to days to conduct this meeting 
we plan to finalize the overall development program for solithromycin for cabp with the fda at this meeting  which we expect will occur in the first half of we plan to initiate the trial in the second half of  subject to available resources 
in addition  we intend to conduct a number of studies to support fda approval  including a thorough qt  or tqt  study to look at cardiac effects  and studies in patients with hepatic insufficiency and renal impairment 
we are exploring the possibility for funding pediatric studies for solithromycin in a range of indications for cabp through the biomedical advanced research and development authority  or barda  an agency of us department of health and human services 
solithromycin as a treatment for bacterial urethritis 
we have demonstrated that solithromycin has in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens that cause bacterial urethritis  including n 
gonorrhoeae  chlamydia trachomatis  mycoplasma genitalium  ureaplasma urealyticum etc 
in our phase study  we have demonstrated to date that solithromycin is effective in treating gonococcal urethritis cervicitis  and pharyngeal and rectal gonococcal infections 
the cdc no longer recommends oral cefixime to be used in the treatment of gonorrohea and the recommended treatment is intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone 
resistance to ceftriaxone has been reported 
there is no oral antibiotic currently recommended for treating gonorrhea as well as for treatment of sexual partners of infected patients 
this need has become a public health crisis and the who and us government are looking for alternative treatments 
we are discussing possible grant funding opportunities with the niaid to pursue solithromycin in a pivotal phase trial for the treatment of bacterial urethritis  primarily gonnorhea 
potential biodefense application for solithromycin 
solithromycin is active against bioterror threat pathogens such as b 
anthracis  yersinia pestis and francisella tularensis 
in order to explore the potential for its use to provide broad protection in a bioterror threat  we are exploring the possibility for funding studies on solithromycin through barda 
taksta fusidic acid overview taksta  our fusidic acid product candidate  is an oral antibiotic that we are developing in the us for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections  which are frequently caused by staphylococci  including coagulase negative and coagulase positive staphlycocci and mrsa 
fusidic acid is the only member of a unique class of antibiotics  called fusidanes  and has a mechanism of action that differs from any other antibiotic 
fusidic acid has been approved and sold for several decades in europe and other countries outside the us and has a long established safety and efficacy profile  but has never been approved in the us we have conducted in vitro tests of 
table of contents taksta s activity against thousands of strains of s 
aureus found in the us and our data show that virtually all of those strains tested are susceptible to taksta 
in addition  we believe taksta has the potential to be used in hospital and community settings on both a short term and chronic basis 
our completed phase clinical study has shown taksta to be comparably effective to linezolid  a treatment for the common skin infection s 
aureus and the only oral antibiotic approved by the fda to treat mrsa 
taksta market opportunity according to a survey of physicians conducted by decision resources  staphylococcus aureus  including mrsa  is the most important pathogen of concern in patients with osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infection 
the other major pathogen involved in pji is coagulase negative staphlycocci 
bone infections generally begin with bacteria that reside on the skin and enter the bloodstream through breaks in the skin or mucous membrane that occur as a result of a wound or due to a surgical  medical or dental procedures 
according to the idsa  mrsa infections account for approximately of skin infections seen in us emergency rooms 
the most common treatments for prosthetic joint infection with mrsa currently are vancomycin available as a generic and sometimes daptomycin sold under the brand name cubicin  both of which are available only as iv formulations for systemic infections 
linezolid  which is also prescribed for prosthetic joint infections  is available in both iv and oral formulations and is the only oral antibiotic approved by the fda for mrsa 
linezolid  however  has significant side effects  which include irreversible peripheral neuritis  or the inflammation of nerves and thrombocytopenia  or a relative decrease of platelets in blood 
it is recommended that linezolid not be taken for more than days without additional monitoring because of the increased possibility of these side effects 
in addition  on july   the fda published a drug safety communication letter regarding the use of linezolid in patients on serotonergic drugs such as ssris including prozac  paxil and zoloft  which are taken for depression  bipolar disease  schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders 
given the widespread use of ssris and some of the other side effects associated with linezolid  we do not believe that linezolid is an option for many patients 
we believe there is an opportunity to develop an oral drug that is effective against mrsa and has a safety profile that supports out patient use  use for chronic indications and use in children 
in  nearly  total knee or hip arthroplasty procedures were performed in the us  with an overall infection rate of approximately 
it has been predicted that the demand for knee revision surgery will double by  and increase by by the year as the population ages 
with steadily increasing numbers of patients in the us undergoing prosthetic joint surgery  we expect there will be a corresponding increase in the overall incidence of prosthetic joint infections 
prosthetic joint infections usually occur when bacteria enter the area of the prosthesis during implantation 
however  they may also occur through other surgical  medical or dental procedures or by accident when the skin or mucous membrane is broken  enabling surface level bacteria to travel to the prosthesis 
s 
aureus species  including mrsa  are the most commonly identified bacterial pathogens involved in prosthetic joint infections 
the methods for the treatment for pji are variable depending on the severity of the infection and the patient s condition 
the infected prosthesis could be saved or could be replaced 
the antibiotics used to treat these infections depend on the pathogens involved 
staphylococci are the most frequently identified pathogen in pji 
idsa has recently issued guidelines for the treatment of pji osmon  et al  
in almost all cases intravenous vancomycin is administered for two to eight weeks  in combination with oral antibiotics such as rifampin  ciprofloxacin  levofloxacin  cefazolin  clindamycin or bactrim 
the choice of the oral antibiotic is dependent on whether the staphylococcus is mrsa 
rifampin is commonly used as its use has been noted to have better outcome 
two stage revision replacement of an infected prosthesis is most commonly practiced in the us it has been noted that greater than success could be achieved by two stage revision versus success rate if the prosthesis is retained 
these results are in the us where fusidic acid is not available for use 
in the two stage method of treatment  the infected prosthesis is removed  an antibiotic impregnated spacer is installed and the patient is then treated with iv vancomycin for four to six weeks 
after that time  the antibiotic is stopped and after six weeks  the joint is cultured to determine if the infection is cleared and a new prosthesis is introduced 
thus  in the us  patients undergo at least two surgeries  several weeks of intravenous therapy  as well as oral antibiotics 
in europe and australia  two stage revision is less common and the strategy is to debride and treat with intravenous vancomycin and oral rifampin for one to four weeks followed by oral rifampin plus fusidic acid for three months to one to two years 
other oral antibiotics have been used with less success 
in the us  the debride and retention method is less often used in pji patients  but when used in these patients  chronic suppression is used for years with a combination of intravenous and oral antibiotics and the treatment is often a failure 
according to data monitor  physicians indicate that safety is a significant factor for them in choosing antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections because the population of patients receiving prosthetic joints tends to be older and the treatment duration is longer 
as a result  we believe there is a significant opportunity for a treatment for prosthetic joint infection that is effective against staphylococci  including mrsa  and can be used safely on a long term basis 
outside of the us  fusidic acid has been used successfully in combination with rifampin to achieve high cure rates in selected patients with prosthetic joint infections  without requiring replacement of the prosthesis 
in a recent review of clinical experience at an australian teaching hospital  as well as in the swiss teaching hospital  treatment of staphylococcal prosthetic joint infection with debridement  prosthesis retention  and oral fusidic acid and rifampin therapy achieved an approximately treatment success rate at one year 

table of contents key attributes of taksta we believe taksta can be an effective treatment for prosthetic joint infections because of the following key attributes 
taksta has an established safety profile outside the us fusidic acid has been approved and used in certain countries in europe and in australia for many years  in some countries as many as years  both for short term use in complicated skin infections as well as for long term use in other types of infections requiring long term therapy  including osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections 
further  fusidic acid has been used in pediatric populations outside the us and has been safe and well tolerated 
as fusidic acid has been in clinical use outside the us for several decades  a substantial body of safety data is in the public domain 
safety data from over published clinical study results involving the oral administration of fusidic acid to over an aggregate of  patients demonstrated a safety profile consistent with non us approved product labeling 
these data indicate significant worldwide use of fusidic acid  capture clinical experience in the public domain and characterize the safety profile of fusidic acid 
the safety data from our phase and phase clinical trials are consistent with available historical data and establish that taksta has a favorable safety and tolerability profile 
taksta has demonstrated comparable efficacy to the only fda approved oral treatment for mrsa 
in a phase trial in absssi patients comparing taksta to linezolid  taksta successfully demonstrated efficacy comparable to linezolid and confirmed its effectiveness against s 
aureus and mrsa 
furthermore  in vitro data have demonstrated that taksta has potent activity against more than  strains of s 
aureus  including mrsa strains that are community acquired mrsa  or ca mrsa  hospital acquired mrsa  or ha mrsa  and other known types of mrsa 
we have also conducted tests of taksta s activity against strains of s 
aureus that are found in the us and our data show that virtually all of those strains are susceptible to taksta 
as a result of taksta s broad range of activity against s 
aureus  physicians could use taksta to treat a patient with an infected wound or cellulitis without identifying the particular type of s 
aureus causing the infection 
since fusidic acid has a unique structure and target  there is no known cross resistance with other antibiotics 
taksta is an oral therapy for all types of s 
aureus  including mrsa 
the leading treatments for prosthetic joint infections and absssi caused by mrsa are available only in iv formulations 
linezolid is the only drug currently approved for use against mrsa with an oral formulation 
however  its use is associated with serious side effects and cannot be used in certain patient populations without additional monitoring 
we believe our clinical studies and historical data on fusidic acid demonstrate that taksta has the potential to be a safe and effective oral treatment for prosthetic joint infections and absssi caused by mrsa 
we believe taksta would enable physicians to treat patients not otherwise needing hospitalization on an outpatient basis  thereby reducing hospitalization costs and avoiding the unnecessary introduction of resistant bacteria into the hospital setting 
taksta has a lower incidence of resistance due to our proprietary loading dose regimen 
our in vitro studies have shown that the reason for resistance to fusidic acid that was reported to occur during oral treatment outside the us is that it was not dosed optimally 
in addition  published studies of resistance during oral treatment with fusidic acid outside the us conclude that the frequency of resistance is related to the lack of initial potency  which has been addressed in the past by combination therapy 
our innovative loading dose regimen minimizes the development of resistance by increasing the amount of drug initially delivered to the bacteria 
taksta can be used in patient populations not well served by current treatments 
we believe taksta could also be used for patients that are anemic  as well as patients on serotonergic drugs such as ssris who could be treated with an oral antibiotic  but for whom linezolid may not be a viable or convenient treatment option due to side effects and or increased monitoring requirements 
in addition  none of the antibiotics currently on the market can be used for prolonged periods of time to treat chronic staphylococcal infections due to safety concerns 
we believe taksta could fulfill the need for a safe  long term oral therapy to treat chronic infections such as prosthetic joint infections and osteomyelitis 
furthermore  there are few treatment options for children infected with s 
aureus  especially mrsa  because in children  iv antibiotics have unpredictable blood levels and are inconvenient to dose 
fusidic acid is available in an oral formulation and has been used in pediatric populations outside the us we intend to develop a pediatric formulation of taksta to address the need for a safe and effective oral treatment of staphylococci and streptococci in children 
clinical data fusidic acid has been used outside the us for approximately four decades 
however  fusidic acid has never been approved in the us as a result  we must demonstrate that taksta is active against current strains of staph  including mrsa  that are responsible for infections in the us  as well as to show that it is well tolerated at the dosing regimen that we are developing 
phase clinical trial 
we have successfully completed a phase clinical trial in absssi  comparing taksta to linezolid  which is the only oral antibiotic approved by the fda for treating mrsa infections 
the trial demonstrated that our taksta loading dose regimen has a favorable safety and tolerability profile with efficacy comparable to linezolid 
in this study  patients were stratified by the type of infection  such as wounds and cellulitis  and  through the first patients  were randomized in a ratio to receive a 
table of contents taksta non loading regimen taksta mg twice per day which is similar to the dose practically used in the eu  a taksta loading dose regimen taksta mg twice per day on day  followed by mg twice per day  or linezolid mg twice per day  which is the standard approved dose  each administered for days 
after interim analysis of the initial patients demonstrated comparable safety and tolerability of the two taksta regimens  the taksta non loading dose regimen was dropped in favor of the taksta loading dose regimen  which was shown to have a lower resistance profile in in vitro models  and the remaining patients were randomized in a ratio to receive the taksta loading dose regimen or the linezolid regimen 
a total of patients received either the taksta loading dose regimen or linezolid 
the loading dose followed by maintenance dose strategy was designed to ensure a higher concentration of taksta in the bloodstream at the beginning of the treatment period to rapidly reduce the bacterial population load in an infection  thus limiting resistance development  and to then allow a reduced dose to maintain steady state levels of taksta in the bloodstream  which increases tolerability 
the results from the phase trial demonstrated a clinical cure rate comparable to linezolid as described in table below 
the clinical success rates for the taksta loading dose regimen were comparable to those for the linezolid regimen in the itt  mitt  ce and me populations 
respective clinical success rates at the toc in taksta loading dose and linezolid treatment groups in the itt population were and  in the mitt population  they were  and  in the ce population  they were and  and in the me population  they were and 
importantly  in patients with documented s 
aureus infection at baseline  clinical success rates were and  and with mrsa and  in the me population in the taksta loading dose and linezolid groups  respectively

in august  the fda published new guidance regarding assessment of outcomes for absssi clinical trials  with an emphasis on assessment of the early response to therapy in the itt population 
following this guidance  of study subjects randomized to the taksta loading dose arm achieved an early response defined as both cessation of spread of lesion and absence of fever on treatment day  in patients not otherwise considered a treatment failure compared to of the linezolid subjects  as shown in table below

table of contents the results of the trial demonstrated taksta has a favorable safety and tolerability profile with data comparable to linezolid as shown in table below 
since the study was blinded  we were required to exclude any patient taking ssris  who would have required additional monitoring if administered linezolid 
adverse events were reported in of patients in the taksta loading dose group and in of patients in the linezolid group 
there were no clinically relevant differences between treatment groups in the types or frequency of adverse events  including gastrointestinal events 
notably  the frequency and intensity of nausea and or vomiting were similar in the taksta loading dose and the linezolid treatment groups 
there were more nervous system adverse events reported for linezolid vs 
than for taksta  the majority of which were headaches

three patients in the taksta group discontinued the study medication due to adverse events nausea and chills  blister and maculopapular rash  and nausea  vomiting and anorexia 
phase results 
we previously completed phase single dose  multi dose and loading dose trials with taksta between and these trials were randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled  dose escalation studies to determine the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of single and multiple doses of taksta 
the effect of food on oral bioavailability was measured and food did not have a significant effect on the oral bioavailability  meaning taksta can be taken with or without food 
there were few adverse events and all were mild in severity 
no serious adverse events were seen at the mg dose 
based on these data  loading dose regimens followed by maintenance dose regimens were considered safe and well tolerated up to a combination of mg mg of taksta 
the pharmacokinetics  or pk  of taksta were investigated in three phase trials 
the first trial of subjects evaluated the relative bioavailability of taksta mg tablets compared to fucidin tablets  the marketed product in europe  which contains the same api as taksta but is a different sized tablet  manufactured with different components and dosed differently 
this trial also compared the pk of a single oral dose of taksta mg in the fed versus fasted states 
the second trial assessed the pk of multiple oral doses of taksta mg mg administered three times a day for consecutive days in healthy subjects 
the third trial evaluated the pk of single  multiple  and loading dose regimens of taksta administered to healthy subjects 

table of contents in each trial  taksta was shown to be generally safe and well tolerated 
these trials showed that taksta had a long plasma half life and therefore the drug accumulates in the blood over time when administered at the same high dose daily  as evidenced by taksta showing higher pk after the dose in the second and subsequent periods as compared to the first period 
the results of the trial led to the design of the loading dose which would provide high drug levels on day followed by a steady concentration of taksta of approximately mcg ml  which is well over times the mic 
 or the concentration level needed to inhibit of staphylococci and streptococci  the two organisms most frequently found in skin infections 
pre clinical data we evaluated the in vitro activity of taksta against prevalent community acquired  hospital acquired  and epidemic clones including strains non susceptible to anti mrsa agents 
we have conducted tests of taksta s activity against strains of s 
aureus that are found in the us and our data show that virtually all of those strains are susceptible to taksta 
a collection of mrsa strains from the network on antimicrobial resistance in staphylococcus aureus  or narsa  and eurofins medinet repositories were tested for susceptibility to taksta and comparators by broth microdilution  a method of testing susceptibility using a semi solid or liquid growth medium to conduct dilutions in small volumes  in accordance with current clinical and laboratory standards institute  or clsi  guidelines 
isolates included those with rare resistance phenotypes  linezolid and daptomycin non susceptible isolates and isolates from prevalent community  hospital  and epidemic clones 
against the selected resistant mrsa  taksta had an mic range of g ml with an mic 
and mic 
of g ml 
with the exception of one vancomycin intermediate staphylococcus aureus  or visa  isolate with an mic of g ml  two daptomycin non susceptible isolates with mics of g ml  and one linezolid non susceptible isolate with an mic of g ml  taksta s mics were g ml against mrsa with rare but emerging resistance phenotypes 
against a subset of community  hospital  and five epidemic clones  taksta s mics were g ml 
taksta had potent in vitro activity against mrsa non susceptible to currently approved antibiotics vancomycin  linezolid  and daptomycin 
taksta was also active against usa and usa mrsa clones of mrsa most likely to be encountered clinically in the us today 
based on its potency and activity  these results highlight the potential of taksta for the treatment of mrsa in the us we have continued to determine in vitro activity of taksta against recent strains s 
aureus including mrsa collected in the us the activity of taksta against s 
aureus was stable over the four surveyed years 
taksta showed excellent activity against s 
aureus  strains collected in the us in  including mrsa strains  with of mrsa from the us susceptible to taksta 
only eight s 
aureus strains displaying elevated taksta mic values g ml were detected in the us  which likely carried acquired genes fusb and fusc that confer low level resistance mic  g ml 
these genes are usually part of plasmids that can be co selected by other antimicrobial agents due to the presence of additional resistance genes 
these results continue to demonstrate that taksta could be a valuable alternative for the treatment of staphylococcal infections in the us since the population has not been previously exposed to fusidic acid and resistance is rarely observed among endemic s 
aureus 
furthermore  low s 
aureus resistance rates of fusidic acid in europe are encouraging and suggest that after many years of clinical use  fusidic acid is still a reliable option for the treatment of serious staphylococcal infections 
as required by fda regulations  we conducted pre clinical animal studies of taksta to determine its absorption 
the studies indicated that taksta was not very well absorbed and has a short half life in animals  resulting in minimum exposure levels which limited the ability to test taksta in animal models 
all pre clinical tests were benign and indicated no safety or tolerability issues 
however  because fusidic acid has been used for several decades in humans outside the us and there is sufficient human clinical trial data for taksta  we believe that this animal absorption data will not adversely impact our development efforts for taksta at the fda 
compassionate use data 
we have treated one patient with severe chronic osteomyelitis under our fda approved compassionate use program with taksta 
this patient had been treated unsuccessfully with many known antibiotics over a period of two years and was scheduled for a leg amputation 
after being treated with taksta  the patient recovered  the large leg lesion has healed and the patient has been on taksta for more than months to date 
in canada  where fusidic acid tablets are available  a single patient with s 
aureus infected prosthetic joints in both elbows following severe rheumatoid arthritis had failed on all possible oral medications and was scheduled for amputation of one arm 
after treatment with higher doses than recommended in canada and similar to our loading dose regimen  the arm was saved from amputation and the patient has continued on fusidic acid therapy for over three years to date 
these results  while encouraging  are preliminary  from a small number of patients and of limited value because they were not obtained in a controlled clinical trial 
furthermore  these results may not be predictive of our future trial results  including the result of our planned phase trial regarding prosthetic joint infections 
published ex us studies of sodium fusidate in the treatment of bone and joint infections 
fusidic acid has been used for more than three decades for treatment of bone and joint infections in europe and australia 
atkins and gottlieb 
atkins reviewed published experience with fusidic acid in the treatment of bone and joint infections  citing its utility in the treatment of acute and chronic osteomyelitis  vertebral infection  septic arthritis  and prosthetic and other device related infections 
the authors considered achievement of effective bone and joint fusidic acid concentrations a key factor in its historical efficacy in the treatment of these conditions 
we plan to use several european and australian studies as the basis for our phase study design for taksta for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections 
the study was published in by the european society of clinical microbiology and infectious 
table of contents diseases 
between and  patients in st 
vincent s hospital  a teaching hospital in melbourne  australia  were treated for staphylococcal prosthetic joint infection with debridement  prosthesis retention  and iv antibiotic followed by oral fusidic acid and rifampin 
of the patients  had hip joint replacements and seven had knee joint replacements 
the median duration of iv treatment was days  the median duration of hospitalization was days and the median duration of oral treatment was months 
two patients reported nausea that was severe enough to require a change of treatment 
two patients reported transient nausea  but continued treatment 
no hepatotoxicity was reported 
there was no evidence of treatment failure for patients and patients retained their original prosthesis without any evidence of infection after months of follow up 
the cumulative success of treatment after one year was approximately 
in a retrospective study of patients with mrsa orthopedic device related infection in geneva university hospitals between  of patients with a median follow up of days  patients experienced treatment failure  involving mrsa persistence or recurrence ferry et al  while none of the patients who received a rifampin fusidic acid combination therapy followed by intravenous vancomycin and oral rifampin therapy experienced treatment failure 
lautenbach et al 

measured serum and bone fusidic acid concentrations by agar plate diffusion methods using a susceptible bacterial strain in patients with chronic osteomyelitis during the course of therapy  bone concentrations of active drug ranged from to g g  measured at approximately nine hours after last oral dose in most cases  to mg kg day  divided tid 
hierholzer et al 
 measured bone and soft tissue concentrations at three to six hours after last oral dose mg tid dosing for at least five days in a series of patients with osteomyelitis and found fusidic acid concentrations of to g g in bone and to g g in soft tissue 
a second group of patients studied by the same group were administered fusidic acid mg tid  orally for five to thirteen days prior to surgery for non infected bone disease  concentrations of fusidic acid in bone were on average up to two times higher than those observed in patients with osteomyelitis  and mean concentrations ranged from to of those observed in serum 
chater  et al 

reported fusidic acid concentrations in bone and serum from seven adult patients treated with mg tid oral fusidic acid for osteomyelitis  concentrations of fusidic acid in bone were similar to those described above  and ranged from to of serum concentrations  with consistently higher soft tissue concentrations ranging from to of serum concentrations 
in summary  oral oral fusidic acid dosing was found to achieve drug concentrations at the infected bone and joint site that were associated with effective treatment of osteomyelitis across a number of studies 
rifampin has emerged as a critical antibiotic in the treatment of prosthetic joint infection  attributed to its unique ability to penetrate and disperse biofilms 
in a landmark study  zimmerli and colleagues 
zimmerli demonstrated the important role of rifampin in the effective treatment of prosthetic joint infection when used in combination with initial iv therapy vancomycin or flucloxacillin and follow on oral antibiotic therapy ciprofloxacin 
in that trial  patients with stable implants and a short duration of infection were effectively treated with the debride and retain strategy  with success in of evaluable patients who received a three to six month course of ciprofloxacin rifampin therapy 
there were no mrsa infections in the study population 
drancourt et al 

demonstrated equivalent efficacy of oral fusidic acid rifampin to oral ofloxacin rifampin in a randomized trial of therapy in prosthetic joint infection cases treated with the debride and retain strategy 
in a third report of clinical experience with fusidic acid plus rifampin for orthopedic device related infection comprised principally of joint prostheses and internal fixation devices  ferry et al 

reported clinical success in of patients 
in our proposed development plan for treatment of prosthetic joint infection  taksta will be co administered with rifampin  which we believe will further decrease resistance development 
planned clinical trials we began an open label phase trial of taksta in patients with prosthetic joint infections in december we are testing taksta in two stage revision treatment of pji  as this is the standard of care in the us in our study  the infected joint will be removed  a spacer inserted and intravenous vancomycin only will be used for three to four days  followed by oral rifampin and taksta for six weeks in the study arm  while in the comparator arm  an intravenous standard of care will be continued for six weeks 
after this duration  the joint will be operated on again  in which the spacer taken out and cultured to determine if the joint tissue is uninfected  the patient is left without a joint for another six to eight weeks 
after that time  a new prosthesis is introduced 
the primary end point is bacteriologic cure at weeks  at the time the second prosthesis is introduced 
the secondary end points are retention of the joint for three to six months and safety 
long term monitoring for infection relapse or recurrence will continue for the subsequent two years 
this study is expected to be conducted in patients with hip or knee pjis  and the intent is to show non inferiority to the standard of care for efficacy and to show that two oral drugs can replace an intravenous drug for four to six weeks of treatment 
success in this study could demonstrate a pharmacoeconomic advantage to patients  payers and hospitals  while improving the quality of life 
in the future  we might perform a study in pji patients where two stage revision is not possible or necessary 
such a study would replicate the use of fusidic acid overseas and could provide even greater pharmacoeconomic advantages 
being an open label study  we expect to announce top line results from treated patients during the fourth quarter of and results from all treated patients in the first half of there is no guidance document from the fda for developing antibiotics for treating prosthetic joint infections 
therefore  while our phase study is underway  we plan to request a type c meeting with the fda to determine the future studies or data needed to submit an nda and to explore if we can obtain orphan drug status for taksta for this indication 
we have completed a successful end of phase meeting with the fda for taksta in absssi  however at this time  we do not intend to pursue taksta as a treatment for abssi 

table of contents earlier stage pipeline programs our earlier stage programs include developing other uses for solithromycin and taksta  as well as the development of newly discovered compounds as antibiotics and for the treatment of other diseases 
solithromycin 
in the future we may pursue secondary indications for solithromycin to treat other respiratory tract infections such as pharyngitis  sinusitis and chronic bronchitis  as well as other infectious diseases such as infections in cf patients  otitis media middle ear infection  helicobacter gastritis  malaria  tuberculosis  eye infections and copd 
of these additional indications  we are currently most interested in bacterial urethritis and cf infections 
in cf  the second most common bacteria that infects the lung is s 
aureus  against which solithromycin has demonstrated activity 
in addition  our pre clinical work suggests that solithromycin is likely to have greater anti inflammatory properties than azithromycin  which is commonly used in cf patients for its anti inflammatory properties 
taksta 
given the historical use of fusidic acid and its safety profile  we believe taksta can also address osteomyelitis and infections related to cf  all of which tend to require long term or chronic treatment  as well as absssi that generally requires seven to days of treatment 
fusidic acid is used in certain countries in europe to treat s 
aureus infections in cf patients and is active against s 
aureus strains isolated from cf clinics in the us all s 
aureus strains were susceptible to fusidic acid 
a cf patient has been treated under our compassionate use program for approximately eight months with some demonstrated symptomatic relief 
other research programs 
shortly after our inception  we entered into a collaborative research and development and license agreement with optimer pharmaceuticals  inc  or optimer 
the license agreement gives us exclusive access to a library of over macrolide compounds  which we have further expanded through our own discovery efforts 
macrolides are complex structures which can be chemically modified to eliminate their antibacterial activities 
we intend to use our extensive macrolide library to develop drugs with no antibiotic effect and replace off label use of older macrolides in inflammatory conditions and other indications such as diabetic gastroparesis 
several compounds have been identified through our screening programs that could potentially address therapeutic needs in the areas of inflammation  diabetic gastroparesis and cancer 
we believe that partnering these candidates in the pre clinical stage can result in viable candidates for non antibiotic drugs 
we are conducting pre clinical studies for the use of macrolides in treating diabetic gastroparesis  which is related to a lack of neural response in the gastrointestinal tract of diabetic patients  and gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd  both likely to be helped by addressing motilin function 
motilin is a hormone released in the upper small intestine that helps control the pattern of smooth muscle contractions that initiate in the stomach and carry through to the small and large intestines 
erythromycin and related antibiotics have known activity as motilin agonists 
through our screening program  we have selected a lead candidate that is active in the motilin receptor binding assay  functional assays using cloned human motilin receptor in mammalian cells  as well as in rabbit duodenal strip contraction assays 
these compounds have been optimized for pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability and are in pre clinical development 
our commercialization strategy we will pursue commercialization strategies intended to maximize the value of each product 
we plan to develop our product candidates through late stage clinical studies and  upon approval  either sell our products directly through our own hospital based sales force  which we would need to assemble  or through partnerships  which we would need to negotiate with larger pharmaceutical companies 
solithromycin 
the solithromycin opportunity will be maximized by having both a hospital based sales force and a primary care sales force 
we believe we could build a sales force to sell directly to the hospital market 
a large pharmaceutical company with an established commercial organization may be better positioned to maximize solithromycin sales in the primary care market 
there may be an opportunity to partner with a large pharmaceutical company in a manner that enables us to retain either promotion or co promotion rights in certain markets  such as the hospital market 
we believe solithromycin represents an attractive commercialization opportunity outside the us and we plan to seek commercial partners in selected regions as appropriate 
we also plan to conduct the necessary trials to establish the utility of solithromycin for the treatment of a broader variety of respiratory and other infections including sinusitis  bronchitis and other forms of pneumonia 
taksta 
the initial market for taksta will be in the treatment of prosthetic joint infections 
patients with prosthetic joint infections are generally admitted to the hospital to begin antibiotic treatment and determine whether a debridement procedure that retains the prosthetic joint will be performed or whether the prosthetic joint will be removed 
following whatever procedure is necessary  patients are discharged and treated on an outpatient basis 
subject to finding a collaborative partner  the next market for taksta would be in the us in the hospital emergency department for treatment of absssi infections 
both markets could also be addressed by the same hospital based sales force we may build to sell solithromycin 
secondary markets for taksta include dermatology  podiatry  plastic surgery and pediatrics community practices in the us  which may be best addressed by a larger pharmaceutical partner 
we also plan  through clinical trials  regulatory filings and publications  to expand the data establishing the utility of taksta for the treatment of a wide variety of serious infections including osteomyelitis  especially in the pediatric population 

table of contents competition our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies  academic institutions  government agencies and research institutions 
we believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of solithromycin  taksta and any other product candidates that we develop are efficacy  safety and tolerability profile  convenience in dosing  price and reimbursement 
many of our potential competitors  including many of the organizations named below  have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and significantly more experience in the discovery  development and regulatory approvals of products  and the commercialization of those products 
accordingly  our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining fda approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance 
our competitors drugs may be more effective  or more effectively marketed and sold  than any drug we may commercialize and may render solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates that we become obsolete or non competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any product candidates 
we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market  as advanced technologies become available and as generic forms of currently branded drugs become available 
finally  the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non competitive or obsolete 
we anticipate that  if approved  solithromycin will compete with other antibiotics that demonstrate cabp activity 
these include azithromycin sold under the brand names zithromax and z pak by pfizer inc and available as a generic  clarithromycin sold under the brand name biaxin by abbott laboratories and available as a generic  moxifloxacin sold under the brand name avelox by bayer ag  levofloxacin sold under the brand name levaquin by johnson johnson and available as a generic  linezolid sold under the brand name zyvox by pfizer inc  ceftriaxone sold under the brand name rocephin by f 
hoffman la roche ltd and available as a generic and ceftaroline sold under the brand name teflaro by forest laboratories  inc 
we also are aware of various drugs under development for the treatment of cabp  including bc under development by nabriva therapeutics ag and licensed to forest labs  delafloxacin under development by rib x pharmaceuticals  inc  and omadacycline ptk under development by paratek pharmaceuticals  inc 
we anticipate that  if approved  taksta will compete with other antibiotics that demonstrate mrsa activity 
these include vancomycin  linezolid sold under the brand name zyvox by pfizer inc  daptomycin sold under the brand name cubicin by cubist pharmaceuticals  inc  quinupristin dalfopristin sold under the brand name synercid by pfizer  inc  tigecycline sold under the brand name tygacil by pfizer inc  and ceftaroline sold under the brand name teflaro by forest laboratories  inc 
in addition  an nda has recently been approved for telavancin to be sold as vibativ by theravance  inc and astellas pharma  inc 
further  we expect that product candidates currently in phase development  or that could enter phase development in the near future  may represent significant competition if approved 
these include ceftobiprole under development by basilea pharmaceutica ag and approved in canada and switzerland  omadacycline ptk under development by paratek pharmaceuticals  inc  nxl under development by astrazeneca plc  radezolid under development by rib x pharmaceuticals  inc  tedizolid under development by trius therapeutics  inc  delafloxacin under development by rib x pharmaceuticals  inc  dalbavancin under development by durata therapeutics  inc and oritavancin under development by the medicines company 
a number of generic antibiotics are used to treat staphylococcal prosthetic joint infections  including levofloxacin  ciprofloxacin  cefazolin  trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole bactrim doxycycline  nafcillin rifampin 
none of them  however  can be used in monotherapy to treat prosthetic joint infections and none of them are approved for mrsa infections 
intellectual property due to the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products to market  biopharmaceutical companies have traditionally placed considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for significant new technologies  products and processes 
solithromycin is a new chemical entity developed from the macrolide library of compounds licensed from optimer and is covered by a series of patents and patent applications  which claim  among other things  the composition of matter of solithromycin 
the original patents covering the composition of matter for fusidic acid have expired 
our proprietary position for taksta has two bases 
for prosthetic joint infections  if taksta is the first fusidic acid product approved by the fda  it would be a new chemical entity  or nce  and would receive five years of data exclusivity under the hatch waxman act  which would be increased to years under the gain act should it be passed by congress 
if cempra is successful in obtaining orphan drug status for prosthetic joint infections  the first exclusivity period would be extended to seven years and this period  together with the five years granted under the gain act  would provide years exclusivity 
in addition  we expect that taksta would also be eligible for pediatric exclusivity 
for infections such as absssi  we intend to rely on our loading dose regimen  which is subject to a filed patent application  the opportunity for regulatory exclusivity in the us under the hatch waxman act and our exclusive supply relationship with ercros sa  as further detailed in manufacturing 

table of contents our success will depend in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of solithromycin  taksta and our other product candidates  technology  and know how  to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others  and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions  and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovation  and in licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position 
we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future  nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology 
most of our portfolio consists of intellectual property that we own ourselves or that we exclusively license from optimer 
the intellectual property licensed from optimer primarily relates to solithromycin and related compounds  and to other macrolide and ketolide compounds 
internally  we typically develop those compounds further and refine them to determine commercial applicability 
we have applied  and are applying  for patents directed to our three main areas of focus macrolide and ketolide antibiotics  fusidic acid antibiotics  and macrolides and ketolides for non antibiotic uses  both in the us and  when appropriate  in other countries 
as of december   our owned and in licensed patent portfolio consisted of two issued patents in the us  and approximately other patent applications pending worldwide 
of these  approximately five patent applications  which are not licensed from optimer  relate to fusidic acid 
with respect to solithromycin and a broad group of macrolide antibiotics  our us patent portfolio consists of two issued us patents  us patent nos 
 and  each entitled novel antibacterial agents  which we exclusively license from optimer 
us patent no 
 us issued on october  and is scheduled to expire in  including a patent term adjustment of days under usc b 
usc patent no 
 us issued on september   is scheduled to expire in  and does not include a patent term adjustment under usc b 
the exclusively in licensed portfolio also includes a continuing patent application of us and us pending in the us  corresponding patent applications pending in canada and europe european patent convention  and a patent registration that has been initiated in hong kong 
prosecution is ongoing in each of those patent applications 
each of the foregoing patents and applications ultimately arise from a pct international application filed on march   which claims a priority benefit to us provisional applications filed on march   and may  we have also filed additional patent applications pending in the us  australia  canada  china  europe  israel  india  and japan that claim related chemical compounds  morphological forms  pharmaceutical compositions  pharmaceutical formulations  methods for treating particular infections and other diseases  and or manufacturing processes 
we are seeking to develop a strategy to increase the breadth of solithromycin coverage  particularly in the us  europe  and asia  and prosecution is ongoing in each case 
we have filed patent applications eligible for worldwide coverage claiming two new crystalline forms of solithromycin 
in addition  we have filed patent applications eligible for worldwide coverage claiming processes for manufacturing solithromycin and related compounds from either clarithromycin or erythromycin 
those same patent applications also claim the composition of matter of various intermediates used in those processes 
solithromycin and related compounds have also been described by us in us and international patent applications claiming their use in a treating bacterial infections arising from one or more resistant bacterial strains  including bacterial strains resistant to other macrolides or ketolides  b biowarfare and biodefense applications  c treating mycobacterium infections  including tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium infections  d treating bacterial gastrointestinal diseases  and e treating eye infections 
we have also filed us and international patent applications claiming pharmaceutical compositions and pharmaceutical formulations of solithromycin and related compounds  including lyophilized forms of solithromycin  parenteral formulations of solithromycin for iv and intramuscular delivery  and topical formulations of solithromycin for ocular delivery 
we have filed  or are preparing for filing  us and international patent applications covering solithromycin and other macrolides and ketolides for treating diseases other than infection  including inflammatory diseases  cystic fibrosis  motilin receptor mediated diseases and malaria to increase the breadth of coverage of other macrolides and ketolides in the us  europe  and asia 
we have engaged  and continue to engage  in research efforts to exploit the potential of the in licensed optimer inventions  including solithromycin and related compounds  in new therapy areas  and to discover new forms and formulations of solithromycin and related compounds 
our research efforts have indicated that solithromycin may also be useful in treating particular bacterial infections that may be considered to be generally untreatable with macrolide antibiotics  including bacterial infections arising from one or more resistant strains 
in addition  alternative physical forms and alternative formulations of solithromycin and related compounds are being developed 
if we are able to obtain issued patents for those forms and formulations  and the treatment methods  then we will have several years of additional coverage above and beyond the expiration of the patents covering the chemical composition of solithromycin 
with respect to fusidic acid  we are developing a strategy to increase the breadth of our fusidic acid coverage in the us  europe  and asia 
we have filed patent applications covering fusidic acid in the us and as patent cooperation treaty  or pct  
table of contents international patent applications 
the fusidate sodium chemical entity itself is a compound which is no longer subject to composition of matter patents in the us therefore  our pending patent applications claim new dosing protocols and uses of fusidic acid  and new formulations and packaging 
patent applications have been filed in the us and or the patent cooperation treaty on the novel loading dose regimen that has been developed to overcome pre existing limitations on a broader  more effective use of fusidic acid in the treatment of bacterial infections  including infections not previously considered to be susceptible to fusidic acid  like urethritis  and for new formulations of fusidic acid for direct bronchial and pulmonary delivery 
we have also filed patent applications in the us covering new formulations and packaging of fusidic acid dosage units to overcome the storage limitations of fusidic acid 
each of these applications is also eligible for international patent protection 
in addition to filed patent applications claiming new dosing protocols and formulations of fusidic acid for treating infections  we plan to obtain regulatory exclusivity for the first use of fusidic acid through approval with the fda 
we are not aware of any competing applications before the fda seeking approval for fusidic acid 
therefore  we believe that  if the fda approves an nda of ours for taksta before the fda approves an nda or other application for fusidic acid use filed by any competitor  pursuant to amendments to section of the food  drug and cosmetic act enacted in  we will have at least five years of regulatory exclusivity in the us for the first approved indication for fusidic acid 
we believe that the amendments will also provide us with three years of exclusivity for any additional uses 
the term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained 
in most countries in which we file  the patent term is years from the earliest date of filing a non provisional patent application 
in the us  a patent s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment  which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the us patent and trademark office in granting a patent  or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent 
for a more comprehensive discussion of patent term and extensions thereto  please see business government regulation and product approval 
while we pursue patent protection and enforcement of solithromycin  fusidic acid and our other product candidates  and aspects of our technologies when appropriate  we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position 
to protect this competitive position  we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties  including employees  independent contractors  suppliers and collaborators 
our employment policy requires each new employee to enter into an agreement containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and providing that any invention conceived by an employee within the scope of his or her employment duties is our exclusive property 
we have a similar policy with respect to independent contractors  generally requiring independent contractors to enter into agreements containing provisions generally prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and providing that any invention conceived by an independent contractor within the scope of his or her services is our exclusive property with the exception of contracts with universities and colleges that may be unable to make such assignments 
furthermore  our know how that is accessed by third parties through collaborations and research and development contracts and through our relationships with scientific consultants is generally protected through confidentiality agreements with the appropriate parties 
further  we seek trademark protection in the us and internationally where available and when appropriate 
we have a registered trademark in the us for the cempra mark  which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services  and which we plan to use with our proposed products 
we also have received notices of allowance from the us patent and trademark office for the taksta  strafex  and stafrel marks 
we plan to use the taksta mark with our proposed sodium fusidate product 
the remaining marks may be used with the sodium fusidate product or other proposed products 
collaborations and commercial agreements optimer pharmaceuticals  inc in march  we entered into a collaborative research and development and license agreement with optimer  a biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing innovative anti infective products 
under this agreement  we obtained access to a library of over macrolide compounds  including solithromycin 
optimer granted us an exclusive license to these compounds in all countries of the world except asean countries  with the right to sublicense  under optimer s patents and know how related to certain macrolide and ketolide antibiotics and related proprietary technology 
the exclusivity of our license is potentially subject to the us government s right to obtain a non exclusive  irrevocable  royalty free  paid up right to practice and have practiced certain patents worldwide 
as partial consideration for granting us such license  we issued shares of our common stock to optimer 
we also have an obligation to make additional payments upon achievement of specified development  regulatory and commercialization milestones 
the aggregate amount of such milestone payments we may need to pay is based in part on the number of products developed under the agreement 
the aggregate amount would be million if four products are developed and gain fda approval 
additional limited milestone payments would be due if we develop more than four products 
in july and july  we made million and million milestone payments  respectively to optimer after our successful completion of the phase and phase trials for oral solithromycin  respectively 
we are also obligated to make tiered  mid single digit royalty payments to optimer based on annual net sales of licensed products outside the asean countries  which royalties are subject to reduction in the event additional licenses are obtained from third parties in order to practice our rights under the agreement and or we are required to grant a compulsory license to a third party 

table of contents the agreement also includes the grant of an exclusive license to optimer and its affiliates  with rights of sublicense  under our patents and other intellectual property in any products covered by the agreement to permit optimer to develop and or commercialize such products in asean countries 
in consideration of such license  optimer will pay us million in milestone payments for the first two products that receive regulatory approval or have a first commercial sale in any asean country  as well as tiered  mid single digit royalty payments based on net sales of such products  which royalties are subject to reduction in the event additional licenses are obtained from third parties in order to practice optimer s rights under the agreement and or optimer is required to grant a compulsory license to a third party 
the agreement also included a collaborative research program  to be performed by the parties  which was completed on march  the optimer patents and know how existing as of the effective date of the agreement and improvements thereof remain the property of optimer 
except for such improvements  any know how or inventions developed by optimer pursuant to the agreement or that relate to the licensed products except those generated by using grant monies provided by the us government vest in us subject to the license we granted to optimer 
optimer has the responsibility to prosecute the optimer patents relating to macrolide antibiotics 
we will be responsible for prosecuting any patents controlled by us that relate to macrolide antibiotics other than the optimer patents described above 
we will have the first right to prosecute patents claiming joint inventions 
we have the first right to control any proceeding involving alleged infringement of optimer patents with respect to rights granted to us under the agreement and optimer has such right regarding alleged infringement of our patents with respect to rights granted to optimer under the agreement 
should we exercise our right to control any proceeding involving alleged infringement of optimer patents  we will be responsible for the costs of these proceedings 
subject to certain exceptions  on a country by country and product by product basis  a party s rights and obligations under the agreement continue until the later of i the expiration of the last to expire patent rights of a covered product in the applicable country or ii ten years from the first commercial sale of a covered product in the applicable country 
as a result  the final expiration date of the optimer license is indeterminable until the last such patents issue and results of potential patent extensions are known  or each of the first commercial sales are made  as applicable 
upon expiration of the agreement with respect to a particular product and country  the licenses granted in the agreement with respect to such product and country will remain in effect and convert to a perpetual  unrestricted  fully paid  royalty free  worldwide license 
either party may terminate the agreement i in the event of a material breach by the other party  subject to prior notice and the opportunity to cure  ii in the event the other party fails to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize products in its respective territory  or if the other party makes a determination not to develop and commercialize at least one product under the agreement  or iii in the event of the other party s bankruptcy 
in the case of these terminations  the terminating party can elect that all licenses granted by the other party survive  subject to continuing royalty  payment and other obligations 
additionally  either party may terminate the agreement for any reason upon days prior written notice  in which case the non terminating party can elect that all licenses granted by the other party survive  subject to continuing royalty  payment  and other obligations 
the scripps research institute 
effective june   we entered into a license agreement with the scripps research institute tsri  whereby tsri licensed to the company rights  with rights of sublicense  to make  use  sell  and import products for human or animal therapeutic use that use or incorporate one or more macrolides as an active pharmaceutical ingredient and is covered by certain patent rights owned by tsri claiming technology related to copper catalysed ligation of azides and acetylenes 
the rights licensed to us are exclusive as to the people s republic of china excluding hong kong  south korea and australia  and are non exclusive in all other countries worldwide  except the member nations of the association of southeast asian nations  which are not included in the territory of the license

we are also obligated to pay annual maintenance fees to tsri in the amount of i  each year for the first three years beginning on the first anniversary of the agreement  and ii  each year thereafter beginning on the fourth anniversary of the agreement 
each calendar year s annual maintenance fees will be credited against sales royalties due under the agreement for such calendar year 
under the terms of the agreement  we must pay tsri low single digit percentage royalties on the net sales of the products covered by the tsri patents for the life of the tsri patents  a low single digit percentage of non royalty sublicensing revenue received with respect to countries in the nonexclusive territory and a mid single digit percentage of sublicensing revenue received with respect to countries in the exclusive territory  with the sublicensing revenue royalty in the exclusive territory and the sales royalties subject to certain reductions under certain circumstances 
tsri is eligible to receive milestone payments of up to million with respect to regulatory approval in the exclusive territory and first commercial sale  in each of the exclusive territory and nonexclusive territory  of the first licensed product to achieve those milestones that is based upon each macrolide covered by the licensed patents 
each milestone is payable once per each macrolide 
each milestone payment made to tsri with respect to a particular milestone will be creditable against any payment due to tsri with respect to any sublicense revenues received in 
table of contents connection with the achievement of such milestone 
pursuant to the terms of the optimer agreement  any payments made to tsri under this license for territories subject to the optimer agreement can be deducted from any sales based royalty payments due under the optimer agreement up to a certain percentage reduction of the royalties due to optimer 
under the terms of the agreement  we are also required to pay additional fees on royalties  sublicensing and milestone payments if we  an affiliate with tsri  or a sublicensee challenges the validity or enforceability of any of the patents licensed under the agreement 
such increased payments would be required until all patent claims subject to challenge are invalidated in the particular country where such challenge was mounted 
the term of the license agreement and the period during which we must pay royalties to tsri in a particular country for a particular product will end  on a country by country and product by product basis  at such time as no patent rights licensed from tsri cover a particular product in the particular country 
manufacturing we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of solithromycin  taksta or other product candidates that we might develop  nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future 
we currently depend on third party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials  api and finished products for our pre clinical research and clinical trials 
we employ internal resources and third party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors 
to date  we have ordered pre clinical and clinical supplies for solithromycin under short term contract orders 
we employ the services of wockhardt limited  or wockhardt  in mumbai  india  to produce solithromycin api and finished oral and iv product 
we do not have long term contracts for the commercial supply of solithromycin 
if solithromycin is approved for treatment of cabp by the fda  we intend to enter into agreements with third party contract manufacturers for the commercial production of solithromycin 
we believe there are a number of qualified manufacturers who could supply clinical and commercial quantities of solithromycin 
in january  we entered into a supply agreement with wockhardt whereby we will purchase from wockhardt at least of our total annual purchases of solithromycin in any year for clinical or commercial use in humans 
pursuant to the agreement  we may develop alternative sources of solithromycin for the other of our annual needs 
in the event that we reasonably believe that wockhardt will be or is unable to manufacture and or supply us with our required amounts of solithromycin  we have the right to purchase all or any portion of our solithromycin requirements from such alternate sources 
the agreement s initial term runs until december  after the end of the third complete calendar year ie december   and at the end of each calendar year thereafter  the term will automatically extend for an additional year unless either party gives written notice to the other of its intent to terminate prior to the end of such calendar year  in which case the agreement will terminate at the end of the three remaining calendar years of the term 
we have a long term supply arrangement with ercros  sa  or ercros  in madrid  spain  in which ercros agrees to exclusively supply us with fusidic acid in the us  and we agree to exclusively obtain our supply of fusidic acid for commercial sale from ercros  subject to a right to develop a second source for limited supply quantities to produce fusidic acid for taksta 
the supply agreement with ercros will continue until at least march  subject to earlier termination for our uncured material breach or our bankruptcy or insolvency 
in addition  the exclusivity restrictions on ercros are subject to termination for our failure to file with the fda an nda for the sale of taksta prior to december  we believe ercros is one of only two currently known manufacturers that can produce fusidic acid compliant with the purity required for human use 
fusidic acid is difficult to produce at these purity levels because of its complex fermentation process 
we believe the only other manufacturer of fusidic acid with sufficient purity is leo laboratories  which is using its manufacturing capacity for its own needs 
we have yet to identify a viable alternate source of fusidic acid but continue to research alternatives 
we intend to utilize a third party manufacturer to produce the finished dosing formulation of taksta 
government regulation and product approval government authorities in the us  at the federal  state and local level  and other countries extensively regulate  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  quality control  approval  labeling  packaging  storage  record keeping  promotion  advertising  distribution  marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing 
solithromycin  taksta and any other antibiotic product candidate that we develop must be approved by the fda through the nda process before they may be legally marketed in the us us drug development process in the us  the fda regulates drugs under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or fdca  and implementing regulations 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal  state  local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources 
failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process  approval process or after approval  may subject an applicant to 
table of contents administrative or judicial sanctions 
fda sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications  withdrawal of an approval  a clinical hold  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions  fines  refusals of government contracts  restitution  disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties 
any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 
the process required by the fda before a drug may be marketed in the us generally involves the following completion of pre clinical laboratory tests  animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices  or glp  or other applicable regulations  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to the fda s current good clinical practices  or cgcp  to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use  submission to the fda of an nda for a new drug  satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the fda s cgmps to assure that the facilities  methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug s identity  strength  quality and purity  and fda review and approval of the nda 
the lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain 
before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans  the drug candidate enters the pre clinical testing stage 
pre clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry  toxicity and formulation  as well as animal studies 
the sponsor must submit the results of the pre clinical tests  together with manufacturing information  analytical data and any available clinical data or literature  to the fda as part of the ind 
the sponsor will also include a protocol detailing  among other things  the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial  the parameters to be used in monitoring safety  and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated  if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation 
the ind automatically becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that day time period 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin 
the fda may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non compliance 
each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the ind for fda review  and to an institutional review board  or irb  for approval 
protocols detail  among other things  the objectives of the clinical trial  dosing procedures  subject selection and exclusion criteria  and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety 
an irb is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits 
the irb also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed 
human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined phase the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
in the case of some products for severe or life threatening diseases  especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers  the initial human testing is often conducted in patients 
phase the drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance  optimal dosage and dosing schedule 
phase clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage  clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites 
these clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling 
post approval studies  or phase clinical trials  may be conducted after initial marketing approval 
these studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication 
progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the fda and written ind safety reports must be submitted to the fda and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects 
phase  phase and phase testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period  if at all 
the fda or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
similarly  an irb can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the irb s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients 

table of contents concurrent with clinical trials  companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cgmp requirements 
the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and  among other things  must develop methods for testing the identity  strength  quality and purity of the final drug 
additionally  appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life 
us review and approval processes the results of product development  pre clinical studies and clinical trials  along with descriptions of the manufacturing process  analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug  proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the fda as part of an nda requesting approval to market the product 
the submission of an nda is subject to the payment of substantial user fees  a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances 
in addition  under the pediatric research equity act of  or prea  which was reauthorized under the food and drug administration amendments act of  or fdaaa  an nda or supplement to an nda must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective 
the fda may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers 
unless otherwise required by regulation  prea does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing 
the fda may request additional information rather than accept an nda for filing 
in this event  the nda must be re submitted with the additional information 
the re submitted application also is subject to review before the fda accepts it for filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth substantive review 
the fda reviews an nda to determine  among other things  whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product s identity  strength  quality and purity 
before approving an nda  the fda will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured 
the fda will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cgmp requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications 
during the drug approval process  the fda also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug 
if the fda concludes rems is needed and notifies the drug sponsor of this decision  the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed rems  the fda will not approve a marketing application without a rems  if required 
in addition  under the fdaaa  all nces prior to approval are referred to an advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions  unless the secretary of health and human services provides in the action letter on the drug application a summary of the reasons why it was not referred 
an advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the fda on matters of importance that come before the agency 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it generally follows such recommendations 
the approval process is lengthy and difficult and the fda may refuse to approve an nda if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information 
even if such data and information is submitted  the fda may ultimately decide that the nda does not satisfy the criteria for approval 
data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data 
the fda will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the nda in its present form 
the complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the nda identified by the fda 
the deficiencies identified may be minor  for example  requiring labeling changes  or major  for example  requiring additional clinical trials 
additionally  the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval 
if a complete response letter is issued  the applicant may either resubmit the nda  addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter  or withdraw the application 
if a product receives regulatory approval  the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited  which could restrict the commercial value of the product 
further  the fda may require that certain contraindications  warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling 
in addition  the fda may require phase testing which involves post approval clinical trials designed to further assess a drug safety and effectiveness after nda approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized 

table of contents under the orphan drug act  special incentives exist for companies to develop products for rare diseases or conditions  which are defined to include those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than  people in the us companies must submit their request that the fda grant a drug orphan designation prior to submission of an nda or biologic license application for that product 
products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development  fda assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols  potential tax credits for research  reduced filing fees for marketing applications  and a special seven year period of market exclusivity after marketing approval 
orphan drug exclusivity prevents fda approval of applications by others for the same drug and the designated orphan disease or condition 
the fda may approve a subsequent application from another entity if the fda determines that the application is for a different drug or different use  or if the fda determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior  or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public s need 
a grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved 
if a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval  there can be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another entity or a similar drug from receiving approval for the same or other uses 
patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity depending upon the timing  duration and specifics of fda approval of the use of our product candidates  some of our us patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  commonly referred to as the hatch waxman act 
the hatch waxman act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the fda regulatory review process 
however  patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of years from the product s approval date 
subject to certain limitations  the patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of an nda plus the time between the submission date of an nda and the approval of that application  up to a total of five years 
only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension 
the application for such extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within days of the drug s approval 
the united states patent and trademark office  in consultation with the fda  reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration 
similar provisions are available in europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug 
in the future  we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date  depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant nda 
market exclusivity provisions under the fdca can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company s nda 
the fdca provides a five year period of non patent data exclusivity within the us to the first applicant to obtain approval of an nda for a new chemical entity 
a drug is a new chemical entity if the fda has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety  which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance 
during the exclusivity period  the fda may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  or a b nda submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval 
however  an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non infringement to one of the patents listed with the fda by the innovator nda holder 
the fdca also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an nda  b nda or supplement to an existing nda if new clinical investigations  other than bioavailability studies  that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the fda to be essential to the approval of the application  for example new indications  dosages or strengths of an existing drug 
this three year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the fda from approving andas for drugs containing the original active agent 
five year and three year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full nda 
however  an applicant submitting a full nda would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre clinical studies and adequate and well controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness 
pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the us pediatric exclusivity  if granted  provides an additional six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms 
this six month exclusivity  which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term  may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an fda issued written request for such a study 
the current pediatric exclusivity provision was reauthorized in september as part of the fdaaa 
we believe that both solithromycin and taksta will benefit from the marketing incentives of the gain act  enacted in this legislation rewards a qualified infectious disease product with five years of additional exclusivity added to the five years of hatch waxman exclusivity when its nda is approved 
the nda also receives priority review  which reduces the standard month review time by four months 
because solithromycin and taksta are being developed to treat indications that involve mrsa  we believe each will qualify as a qualified infectious disease product because mrsa has been identified as a qualified infections disease pathogen 
fusidic acid has been approved for oral use in many countries  including western countries  outside the us for more than three decades to treat absssi  as well as other types of infections caused by staphylococci and hemolytic streptococci  but it has never 
table of contents been approved in the us this is because of the general lack of intellectual property protection that was available for the molecule until recently 
significant patent protection expired in the s  and antibiotics were not eligible for hatch waxman act data exclusivity  which affords a five year period of data exclusivity upon approval of a new chemical entity  or nce  in the us in november  the fda modernization act  or fdama  repealed section of the federal  food  drug  and cosmetic act  or fdca  under which marketing applications for antibiotics were previously approved 
this law made antibiotics  like other drugs  eligible for hatch waxman act exclusivity 
however  fusidate fusidic acid was the subject of a marketing application received by fda under section of the fdca before november   the effective date of fdama 
antibiotics for which marketing applications were submitted before that date  even if the application was not approved  as was the case with fusidic acid  are known as old antibiotics 
old antibiotics were not eligible for the exclusivity provisions afforded by fdama 
consequently  although fusidic acid had never been approved in the us  as an old antibiotic  it was not eligible for the five year nce exclusivity 
the passage of public law pl on october   allowed old antibiotics such as fusidic acid to obtain five year nce exclusivity upon nda approval  thereby making development of fusidic acid for the us feasible 
in response to our question based on unclear language in pl regarding other exclusivities  we received notification from the fda in january that old antibiotics such as fusidic acid would also be eligible for orphan and pediatric exclusivity 
the generating antibiotic incentives now gain act hr was introduced in june this law would extend the nce data exclusivity period for qualified antibiotic products such as fusidic acid from five years to years 
post approval requirements any drug product for which we receive fda approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including  among other things  record keeping requirements  reporting of adverse experiences with the product  providing the fda with updated safety and efficacy information  product sampling and distribution requirements  cgmp requirements  complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with fda promotion and advertising requirements 
the fda strictly regulates labeling  advertising  promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market 
drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products 
drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with cgmp and other laws 
future fda and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution  or require substantial resources to correct 
in addition  changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior fda approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims  are also subject to further fda review and approval 
the fda may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems quality or safety occur after the product reaches the market 
later discovery of previously unknown quality  safety  or other problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
further  the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions  such as fines  warning letters  holds on clinical trials  product recalls or seizures  product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products  refusal to approve pending applications or supplements  restrictions on marketing or manufacturing  injunctions or civil or criminal penalties 
in addition  from time to time  legislation is drafted  introduced and passed in the us congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval  manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the fda 
for example  in september  the fdaaa was enacted giving the fda enhanced post market authority  including the authority to require post market studies and clinical trials  labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy 
failure to comply with any requirements under the new law may result in significant penalties 
the law also authorized significant civil money penalties for the dissemination of false or misleading direct to consumer advertisements and allows the fda to require companies to submit direct to consumer television drug advertisements for fda review prior to public dissemination 
additionally  the law expanded the clinical trial registry so that sponsors of all clinical trials  except for phase clinical trials  are required to submit certain clinical trial information for inclusion in the clinical trial registry data bank 
in addition to this legislation  the fda regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products 
it is impossible to predict whether further legislative or fda regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
other us health care laws and compliance requirements in the us  our activities are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities in addition to the fda  including the centers for medicare and medicaid services formerly the health care financing administration  other divisions of the us department of health and human services eg  the office of inspector general  the us department of justice and individual us attorney offices within the department of justice  and state and local governments 
for example  sales  marketing and scientific educational grant programs must comply with the anti fraud and abuse provisions of the social security act  the false claims act  the privacy provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa  and similar state laws  each 
table of contents as amended 
pricing and rebate programs must comply with the medicaid rebate requirements of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of and the veterans health care act of  each as amended 
if products are made available to authorized users of the federal supply schedule of the general services administration  additional laws and requirements apply 
under the veterans health care act  or vhca  drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including us department of veterans affairs and us department of defense  the public health service and certain private public health service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including medicare and medicaid 
recent legislative changes purport to require that discounted prices be offered for certain us department of defense purchases for its tricare program via a rebate system 
participation under the vhca requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas  as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the federal acquisition regulations 
in order to distribute products commercially  we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state  including  in certain states  manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state 
some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution  including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain 
several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs  file periodic reports with the state  make periodic public disclosures on sales  marketing  pricing  clinical trials and other activities or register their sales representatives  as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other health care entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing  and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices 
all of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws 
foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the us  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the us whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
eu member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial 
under the eu regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all eu member states 
the centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes  products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients 
the decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other  or concerned  member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state  known as the reference member state 
under the decentralized approval procedure  an applicant submits an application  or dossier  and related materials draft summary of product characteristics  draft labeling and package leaflet to the reference member state and concerned member states 
the reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within days after receipt of a valid application 
within days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report  each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials 
if a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health  the disputed points may eventually be referred to the european commission  whose decision is binding on all member states 
pharmaceutical coverage  pricing and reimbursement significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval 
in the us and markets in other countries  sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend considerably on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors 
third party payors include government health administrative authorities  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product 
third party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list  or formulary  which might not include all of the fda approved drugs for a particular indication 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services  in addition to their safety and efficacy 
we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products  in addition to the costs required to obtain fda approvals 
our products may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective 
a payor s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved 
adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 

table of contents in  the us government enacted legislation providing a prescription drug benefit for medicare recipients  which became effective at the beginning of government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval 
however  to obtain payments under this program  we would be required to sell products to medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation 
these plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act became law  which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers 
we anticipate that this legislation will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product 
federal  state and local governments in the us continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of health care costs  including the cost of prescription drugs 
future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing 
different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries 
in the european community  governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers 
some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed 
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval  some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of our particular drug products to currently available therapies 
other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines  but monitor and control company profits 
the downward pressure on health care costs in general  particularly prescription drugs  has become very intense 
as a result  increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products 
in addition  in some countries  cross border imports from low priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country 
the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time 
even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval  less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future

factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference 
if any of the following risks  or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant  develop into actual events  then our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 
if that happens  the market price of our common stock could decline  and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment 
risks related to our business we are heavily dependent on the success of solithromycin and taksta  which are still under clinical development 
the fda and foreign regulatory approval process is lengthy  time consuming and inherently unpredictable and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for solithromycin or taksta our business will be substantially harmed 
we have no products that have been approved for sale 
our near term prospects are substantially dependent on our ability to develop and commercialize solithromycin and taksta 
we cannot commercialize  market or sell either product in the us without fda approval 
fda approval  if received  is several years away at least 
to commercialize solithromycin outside of the us  we would need applicable foreign regulatory approval 
the clinical development of solithromycin and taksta is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent in any stage of drug development  including failure to achieve efficacy across a broad population of patients  the occurrence of severe adverse events and the fda or any applicable foreign regulatory authority determining that a drug product is not approvable 
the process required to obtain approval for commercialization from the fda and similar foreign authorities is unpredictable  and typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials depending on numerous factors 
in addition  approval policies  regulations  or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to obtain regulatory approval may change during the course of a product s clinical development 
we may fail to obtain regulatory approval for solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates for many reasons  including the following we may not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication  the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval  and or the fda may require additional  expensive trials  the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials  we may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks  we may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate is non inferior or superior to the current standard of care  future competitive therapies in development  or over placebo in any indications for which the fda requires a placebo controlled trial  the data collected from clinical trials of any product candidates that we develop may not be sufficient to support the submission of a new drug application  or nda  or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the us or elsewhere  the approval policies or regulations of the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval  the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from pre clinical studies or clinical trials  the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites  the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the clinical practices of the third party clinical research organizations  or cros  we use for clinical trials  and the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies 
this lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval to market solithromycin  taksta or any future product candidates  which would significantly harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 

table of contents clinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome  and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results 
clinical testing is expensive  can take many years to complete and its outcome is highly uncertain 
failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process due to inadequate performance of a drug or inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols 
pursuant to fda guidelines  new drugs must show non inferiority or superiority to existing approved treatments 
we have conducted our solithromycin for cabp and taksta for absssi clinical trials pursuant to proposed guidelines published by the fda for drugs being developed for the treatment of cabp and absssi  respectively 
to date  those clinical trials demonstrate solithromycin and taksta are comparable to current standards of care 
however  because the numbers of patients in our phase trial for the oral formulation of solithromycin and our phase trial for taksta for absssi were small  our results were not powered to show  and did not show  statistical non inferiority 
if in our ongoing and any later clinical trials solithromycin or taksta fails to demonstrate safety and or superiority or non inferiority according to fda guidelines  the fda will not approve that product candidate and we would not be able to commercialize it  which will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
our ongoing and planned phase trials for solithromycin may be more expensive and time consuming than we currently expect 
fda regulations require two phase trials for any drug for which an nda is submitted 
with passage of the gain act  we believe that we will only need to conduct one phase trial for oral solithromycin and one phase iv to oral trial because we believe we will have developed the necessary data to support our planned nda and satisfy the fda requirement 
however  the fda could insist that we conduct two phase trials for oral solithromycin and two phase trials for iv to oral solithromycin  which would add to the time and cost of solithromycin s development 
in addition  the results of pre clinical studies and early clinical trials of product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later stage clinical trials 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  including those with greater resources and experience than us  have suffered significant setbacks in phase and phase clinical trials despite achieving successful results in earlier stage trials 
the failure to obtain positive results in any of our phase or phase clinical trials could seriously impair the development prospects  and even prevent regulatory approval  of solithromycin or taksta or any candidate in our existing proprietary macrolide library 
we have no experience as a company in bringing a drug to regulatory approval 
as a company  we have never obtained regulatory approval for  or commercialized  a drug 
it is possible that the fda may refuse to accept any or all of our planned ndas for substantive review or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of solithromycin  taksta or any future product candidates 
if the fda does not accept or approve any or all of our planned ndas  it may require that we conduct additional clinical  pre clinical or manufacturing validation studies  which may be costly  and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications 
in addition  there is no fda guidance on the approval process and study size for prosthetic joint infections and the fda could require large non inferiority trials that could be costly and difficult to conduct 
depending on the extent of these or any other fda required studies  approval of any nda or other application that we submit may be significantly delayed  possibly for several years  or may require us to expend more resources than we have available 
any delay in obtaining  or an inability to obtain  regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing solithromycin or taksta  generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability 
it is also possible that additional studies  if performed and completed  may not be considered sufficient by the fda to approve any nda we submit 
if any of these outcomes occur  we may be forced to abandon our planned ndas for either solithromycin or taksta or both  which would materially adversely affect our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations 
we face similar risks for any approval in a foreign jurisdiction 

table of contents future legislation  and or regulations and policies adopted by the fda or other regulatory health authorities may increase the time and cost required for us to conduct and complete clinical trials for solithromycin  taksta or other product candidates that we develop 
the fda has established regulations  guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process  as have foreign regulatory authorities 
any change in regulatory requirements due to the adoption by the fda and or foreign regulatory authorities of new legislation  regulations  or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes 
such amendments to existing protocols and or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones  may significantly impact the cost  timing and completion of the clinical trials 
in particular  drugs being tested and or developed for the treatment of cabp and absssi  including solithromycin and taksta  are subject to proposed guidelines published by the fda in march with new guidelines proposed in november and august  respectively 
we have conducted our clinical trials to date according to the standards established by these proposed guidelines  but we expect the fda will revise the proposed guidelines for cabp before we submit our nda for solithromycin 
any new proposed guidelines may require us to conduct additional clinical trials  re run previously completed trials to gather data at different endpoints or according to different protocols  or otherwise materially alter our planned clinical development of solithromycin 
any such regulatory change may materially increase our costs  delay the completion of our clinical trials  and otherwise impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate 
furthermore  the fda s guidance documents are not binding on the fda 
as a result  the fda may not accept the results of clinical trials we conduct even though they follow the fda s most recent guidance 
in addition  increased scrutiny by the us congress of the fda s approval process  particularly in our areas of focus  may significantly delay or prevent regulatory approval  as well as impose more stringent product labeling and post marketing testing and other requirements 
we might not successfully differentiate solithromycin from telithromycin ketek  a macrolide found to cause severe side effects 
ketek is a macrolide antibiotic that the fda approved in for the treatment of multi drug resistant pneumococci and other cabp bacteria 
soon after release  however  ketek was found to cause reversible visual disturbances  exacerbate myasthenia gravis a neurological disorder characterized by improper muscle regulation and cause liver failure 
these effects led the fda to require the drug label for ketek to include a strengthened warning section regarding specific drug related adverse events and contributed to ketek being withdrawn in for the treatment of all infections other than cabp 
our research suggests these side effects are likely caused by pyridine  which is a component of ketek 
solithromycin and older generation macrolides  including azithromycin and clarithromycin  do not have a pyridine component  which we have demonstrated inhibits the action of nicotinic acid acetylcholine receptors that could result in the side effects caused by ketek 
if our research is proven to be incorrect or if solithromycin demonstrates similar side effects  the fda might not approve solithromycin  or  if already approved  might withdraw approval  require us to conduct additional clinical trials or require warnings on product labeling  which would significantly harm our ability to generate revenues from solithromycin 
even if the fda approves solithromycin  physicians may not be convinced that solithromycin is a safe and effective treatment for cabp and other infections 
if physicians believe solithromycin demonstrates characteristics similar to ketek  they might not prescribe solithromycin  which would negatively affect our revenues 
bacteria might develop resistance to solithromycin or taksta  which would decrease the efficacy and commercial viability of that product 
drug resistance is primarily caused by the genetic mutation of bacteria resulting from sub optimal exposure to antibiotics where the drug does not kill all of the bacteria 
while antibiotics have been developed to treat many of the most common infections  the extent and duration of their use worldwide has resulted in new mutated strains of bacteria resistant to current treatments 
we are developing solithromycin and taksta to treat patients infected with drug resistant bacteria 
with respect to solithromycin  which is a next generation macrolide  resistance issues associated with earlier generations of macrolides have led to a decrease in their use for treating serious respiratory tract infections such as cabp 
if physicians  rightly or wrongly  associate the resistance issues of earlier generation macrolides with solithromycin  physicians might not prescribe solithromycin for treating a broad range of infections 
similarly  resistance to fusidic acid has developed outside the us our in vitro studies have shown that the reason for resistance to the oral formulation is that it was not dosed optimally 
we believe that overuse of topical formulations of fusidic acid also contributed to development of resistance outside the us if taksta is improperly dosed  or if our studies incorrectly attributed an increase in resistance to inappropriate dosing  bacteria might develop resistance to taksta in the us if these bacteria develop resistance to solithromycin or taksta  the efficacy of these products would decline  which would negatively affect our potential to generate revenues from these products 

table of contents delays in clinical trials are common and have many causes  and any such delays could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales as currently contemplated 
we may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates 
our planned clinical trials might not begin on time  may be interrupted or delayed once commenced  might need to be redesigned  might not enroll a sufficient number of patients or might not be completed on schedule  if at all 
clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including the following delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial  imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the fda or other regulatory authorities  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective cros and clinical trial sites  delays in obtaining required institutional review board  or irb  approval at each site  delays in identifying  recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators  delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial  delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post treatment follow up  clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment  time required to add new sites  delays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials  including suitable active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  or delays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of the data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  for a trial 
we were subject to such a delay in when the fda placed a partial clinical hold on our phase clinical trial for oral solithromycin over concern about possible toxicity related to solithromycin 
the fda converted the partial clinical hold into a full clinical hold in april at the time  the fda had concerns that solithromycin  as a fluoroketolide  may have similar toxicity issues as ketek 
while we addressed the fda s concerns and were allowed to proceed with the trial  which we successfully completed  the trial was delayed by approximately months 
while the fda has reviewed the results of our phase clinical trial and approved a protocol for our ongoing pivotal phase trial for oral solithromycin and while we reported results of our phase trial for the iv formulation of solithromycin in october  we expect to review our overall development plan for solithromycin with the fda in an end of phase meeting regarding oral solithromycin before we proceed with our planned phase iv to oral trial 
the fda may not allow us to proceed with the iv to oral trial for any of the reasons noted above 
in addition  we are evaluating alternative iv solutions of solithromycin to develop the optimal solution and may experience delays in the commencement of our planned phase iv to oral trial if we cannot develop the solution in a timely or cost effective manner 
patient enrollment  a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials  is affected by many factors  including the size and nature of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the design of the clinical trial  competing clinical trials and clinicians and patients perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies  including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating 
in addition  the timing of our clinical trials for solithromycin is dependent on the onset  degree and timing of the cabp season  which tends to occur in the winter months in each hemisphere 
we could encounter delays in our clinical trials of solithromycin or taksta if participating physician investigators encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of solithromycin or taksta in lieu of prescribing approved antibiotics that have established safety and efficacy profiles 
any of these delays in completing our clinical trials could increase our costs  slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues 
we may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to adverse side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of solithromycin or taksta or any of our future product candidates 
our clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time for a number of reasons 
a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us  our collaborators  the fda or other regulatory authorities due to a failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols  presentation of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects  failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug  changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions  lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial  or negative or equivocal findings of the dsmb or the irb for a clinical trial 
an irb may also suspend or terminate our clinical trials for failure to protect patient safety or patient rights 
we may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants 
in addition  regulatory 
table of contents agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or present an unacceptable safety risk to participants 
if we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any product candidates that we are developing  the commercial prospects of such product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues  if at all  from any of these product candidates will be delayed or eliminated 
any of these occurrences may harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects significantly 
we have not completed a clinical trial of taksta for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections and there is no guarantee that the results of our ongoing phase trial or any other trial we conduct will be consistent with the results of any trials conducted to date or will demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda 
we only recently initiated  in december  our phase clinical trial of taksta for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections 
while we have successfully completed a phase clinical trial comparing taksta to linezolid for the treatment of absssi the results of our completed phase trial for the treatment of absssi were not powered to show  and did not show  statistical non inferiority 
comparisons to results from other reported clinical trials  including our completed phase clinical trial for the treatment of absssi  can assist in evaluating the potential efficacy of taksta for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections  however  there are many factors that affect the outcome for patients in clinical trials  some of which are not apparent in published reports  and results from different trials often cannot be reliably compared 
therefore  there is no assurance that the results of any other trials we conduct for taksta in the treatment of prosthetic joint infections will demonstrate safety and efficacy comparable to the results of trials conducted to date or will be sufficient to attain fda approval 
we previously completed our end of phase meeting with the fda for taksta with respect to the treatment of absssi 
assuming positive results in our phase trial for taksta for prosthetic joint infections  we intend to submit our planned clinical trial activity to support an nda submission for taksta as a treatment for prosthetic joint infections with the fda in the first half of after the receipt of top line data 
if the phase trial data results are inadequate or the fda believes that the plan is inadequate  it could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize taksta for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections 
taksta is not well absorbed in animals  which could impair our ability to obtain fda approval 
as required by fda regulations  we conducted pre clinical studies of taksta to determine its level of absorption in animals 
the studies indicated that taksta is not very well absorbed and has a short half life in animals  resulting in minimum exposure levels which limited the ability to test taksta in animal models 
fusidic acid  the api in taksta  has been used for several decades in humans outside the us and we believe there is sufficient human clinical trial data for taksta to overcome the lack of absorption in animal studies 
despite this human data  and while all of our pre clinical tests were benign and indicated no safety or tolerability issues  our limited ability to test taksta in animal models may adversely affect our ability to obtain fda approval 
even if the fda approves solithromycin for the treatment of cabp and taksta for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections  adverse effects discovered after approval could adversely affect the market for those products 
if we obtain regulatory approval for solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidate that we develop  and we or others later discover that our products cause adverse effects  a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result  including regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product  regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements  such as warnings or contraindications  we may be required to change the way the product is administered  conduct additional clinical studies  implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  or restrict the distribution of the product  we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients and our liability insurance may not adequately cover those claims  and our reputation may suffer 
any of these events could prevent us from maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of  or prevent altogether  the commercialization of our product candidates 
we have had negative cash flows from operations and might not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our existing indebtedness to hercules technology growth capital  inc  the level of which indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
on december   we entered into a loan and security agreement with hercules technology growth capital  inc  or hercules  pursuant to which we borrowed million 
we must repay the indebtedness on or before december  in addition  
table of contents at the time that the loan is either due or prepaid  we must pay hercules a fee of  our ability to make payments on this indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future 
we expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that we will be in a position to repay this indebtedness when due or obtain extensions of the maturity date 
we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding in order for us to be able to satisfy our obligations when due 
we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if that additional funding involves the sale of equity securities or convertible securities  it would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock  which would result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  this level of debt could have important consequences to you as an investor in our securities 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to payments owed to our licensors  limit our flexibility in planning for the development  clinical testing  approval and marketing of our products  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors that are less leveraged than we are  increase our vulnerability to both general and industry specific adverse economic conditions  and limit our ability to obtain additional funds 
in addition  the loan is secured by all of our assets except our intellectual property 
in the event we fail to make timely payments or breach any of our representations or other obligations in the agreement  or upon any circumstance or occurrence that has a material adverse effect on the loan collateral  our business operations  properties  assets  prospects or condition  or our ability to perform our obligations under the loan agreement  hercules can declare the loan in default 
upon an event of default  the loan principal and accrued interest would become immediately due and payable and hercules would be entitled to enforce its security interest in our assets 
the addition of further debt to our current debt levels could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and would intensify the leverage related risks that we now face 
if we fail to obtain additional financing  we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of solithromycin or taksta 
we need substantial amounts of cash to complete the clinical development of solithromycin and taksta 
as of the date of this report  we estimate the cost of our research and development activities through the completion of our phase trial for oral solithromycin for cabp will be approximately million  our costs to complete our qtc  hepatic and renal insufficiency studies of solithromycin will be approximately million  our phase trial for taksta for prosthetic joint infections will be approximately million and cost of drug product and development for those trials and registration will be approximately million  in addition to general and administrative expenses 
the costs to develop solithromycin beyond our ongoing phase oral trial and taksta beyond our ongoing phase trial will be significant and we will need to raise additional capital to continue those development activities 
we expect that our existing cash and equivalents as of december  will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements into this projection does not include funds to initiate the solithromycin phase iv to oral clinical trial 
however  changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate  and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control 
for example  our clinical trials may encounter technical  enrollment or other issues that could cause our development costs to increase more than we expect and we may be required to conduct additional trials requested by the fda that could increase our costs significantly 
we would also need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to initiate clinical trials more rapidly than we presently anticipate or if we elect to conduct additional trials for alternate indications 
in any event  we will require significant amounts of additional capital to obtain regulatory approval of and to commercialize solithromycin and taksta 
we may raise additional capital from the issuance of equity and or debt securities  collaborations with third parties  out licensing of rights to our product candidates and other means  or a combination of any of the above 
securing additional financing  however  will require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from our day to day activities  which may adversely affect our management s ability to conduct our day to day operations 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms  we may be required to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of solithromycin and or taksta  seek collaborators for solithromycin and or taksta at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available  and 
table of contents relinquish or license  potentially on unfavorable terms  our rights to solithromycin and or taksta that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  we will be prevented from pursuing discovery  development and commercialization efforts  and our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability will be substantially harmed 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we may be delayed in obtaining  or may ultimately not be able to obtain  regulatory approval for or commercialize solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates 
we have relied  and plan to continue to rely  on various cros to recruit patients  monitor and manage data for our on going clinical programs for solithromycin and taksta  as well as for the execution of our pre clinical and non clinical studies 
we control only certain aspects of our cros activities  nevertheless  we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol  legal  regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the cros does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities 
we and our cros are required to comply with the fda s current good clinical practices  or cgcps  which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the fda for all of our products in clinical development 
the fda enforces these cgcps through periodic inspections of trial sponsors  principal investigators and clinical trial sites 
if we or our cros fail to comply with applicable cgcps  the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable  and the fda may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our product candidates 
we cannot assure you that  upon inspection  the fda will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cgcps 
in addition  to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of solithromycin and taksta to a statistically significant degree our clinical trials will require an adequately large number of test subjects 
any clinical trial that a cro conducts abroad on our behalf is subject to similar regulation 
accordingly  if our cros fail to comply with these regulations or recruit a sufficient number of patients  we may have to repeat clinical trials  which would delay the regulatory approval process 
in addition  our cros are not our employees and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on going clinical  non clinical and pre clinical programs 
our cros may also have relationships with other commercial entities  including our competitors  for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities  which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs 
if our cros do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines  if they need to be replaced  or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements  or for other reasons  our clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates that we seek to develop 
as a result  our financial results and the commercial prospects for solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates that we seek to develop would be harmed  our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or ended 
we typically engage one or more cros on a project by project basis for each study or trial 
while we have developed and plan to maintain our relationships with cros that we have previously engaged  we also expect to enter into agreements with other cros to obtain additional resources and expertise in an attempt to accelerate our progress with regard to on going clinical  non clinical and pre clinical programs and specifically  the compilation of clinical trial data for submission with an nda for each of solithromycin and taksta 
switching or entering into new relationships with cros involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus 
in addition  there is a natural transition period when a new cro commences work 
as a result  delays occur  which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines 
although we try to carefully manage our relationships with our cros  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of solithromycin  taksta and any future product candidates may cause delays in  or prevent us from  successfully developing and commercializing our products 
we do not currently have nor do we plan to build the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture solithromycin or taksta for use in the conduct of our clinical trials 
in january  we entered into an agreement with wockhardt to supply the api and commercial supply for solithromycin 
wockhardt manufactures solithromycin according to our specifications under our proprietary rights 
while we have the ability to develop alternate sources for solithromycin should wockhardt be unable to supply our needs  we may not be able to negotiate an agreement with another source on acceptable terms  it at all 
we employ the services of ercros sa  or ercros  to produce taksta s api and intend to utilize a third party manufacturer to produce the finished dosing formulation of taksta 
we have a long term exclusive supply arrangement with ercros to produce the fusidic acid used in taksta in which ercros agrees to exclusively supply us with fusidic acid in the us  and we agree to obtain our 
table of contents supply of fusidic acid for commercial sale exclusively from ercros  subject to a right to develop a second source for limited supply quantities 
we believe ercros is one of only two currently known manufacturers that can produce fusidic acid compliant with the purity required for human use 
the second manufacturer is not available as a supplier to us 
fusidic acid is difficult to produce at these purity levels because of its complex fermentation process 
as such  there are underlying risks associated with its manufacture  which could include cost overruns  new impurities  difficulties in scaling up or reproducing manufacturing processes and lack of timely availability of raw materials 
we have yet to identify a viable second source of fusidic acid but continue to research alternatives 
if ercros cannot supply sufficient quantities of fusidic acid to make clinical supplies of taksta  it would harm our ability to develop taksta 
we may not be able to locate a second manufacturer or  if we do  we may not be able to negotiate an agreement on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  regulatory requirements could pose barriers to the manufacture of our api and finished product for solithromycin and taksta 
our third party manufacturers are required to comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations 
as a result  the facilities used by wockhardt  ercros  and any of our future manufacturers to manufacture solithromycin and taksta must be approved by the fda after we submit our nda to the fda and before approval of solithromycin and taksta 
similar regulations apply to manufacturers of our products for use or sale in foreign countries 
we do not control the manufacturing process of solithromycin or taksta and are completely dependent on these third party manufacturing partners for compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements for the manufacture of solithromycin and taksta api and their finished product 
if our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the fda and any applicable foreign regulatory authority  they will not be able to secure the applicable approval for their manufacturing facilities 
if these facilities are not approved for the commercial manufacture of solithromycin or taksta  we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities  which would result in significant delays of up to several years in obtaining approval for solithromycin or taksta 
in addition  our manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cgmps and similar regulatory requirements 
failure by any of our manufacturers to comply with applicable cgmp regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  delays  suspensions or withdrawals of approvals  operating restrictions  interruptions in supply  and criminal prosecutions  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
finally  we also could experience manufacturing delays if our third party manufacturers give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreement between us 
if wockhardt  ercros  or any alternate supplier of api or finished drug product for solithromycin or taksta experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes  does not comply with the terms of the agreement between us or does not devote sufficient time  energy and care to providing our manufacturing needs  we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of solithromycin or taksta  which could impair our ability to supply solithromycin or taksta at the levels required for our clinical trials and commercialization and prevent or delay their successful development and commercialization 
the timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to optimer pharmaceuticals  inc and the scripps research institute is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
in march  we entered into a collaborative research and development and license agreement with optimer pharmaceuticals  inc  or optimer  pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive license to certain patent applications and other intellectual property related to a series of compounds  including solithromycin  to develop and commercialize licensed products outside of the association of south east asian nations  or asean  countries brunei darussalam  cambodia  indonesia  laos  malaysia  myanmar burma  the philippines  singapore  thailand and vietnam 
we have an obligation to make additional payments upon achievement of specified development  regulatory and commercialization milestones 
the aggregate amount of such milestone payments we may need to pay is based in part on the number of products developed under the agreement 
the aggregate amount including our two milestone payments to date would be million if four products are developed and gain fda approval 
additional limited milestone payments would be due if we develop more than four products 
we will also pay tiered mid single digit royalties based on the amount of annual net sales of solithromycin or related licensed compounds  if and when approved by regulatory authorities 
we have already paid a million milestone in and a million milestone in upon completion of our discussions with the fda for the protocol for our pivotal phase trial for oral solithromycin 
optimer can elect to receive certain milestone payments in cash or in shares of our common stock having an equivalent fair market value 
the timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments to optimer is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of solithromycin or related licensed compounds  many of which are beyond our control 
we may become obligated to make a milestone payment when we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment  which could require us to delay our clinical trials  curtail our operations  scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts or seek funds to meet these obligations on terms unfavorable to us 
if we were unable to make a milestone payment  we would be in material breach of the agreement  in which event optimer could terminate the agreement  which would result in the loss of our rights to develop and commercialize solithromycin  which would seriously harm our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability 

table of contents we also must pay the scripps research institute various milestone and annual payments  which  while significantly lower than amounts potentially due to optimer  could become due when we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment  which could require us to delay our clinical trials  curtail our operations  scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts or seek funds to meet these obligations on terms unfavorable to us 
our loan agreement with hercules contains covenants that impose restrictions on our operations that may adversely impact the operation of our business 
our loan agreement with hercules contains customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  transfer or place a lien or security interest on our assets  including our intellectual property  merge with or acquire other companies  redeem any shares of our capital stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders 
these restrictions may inhibit our ability to conduct our business and to provide distributions to our stockholders 
future debt securities or other financing arrangements could contain similar or more restrictive negative covenants than the hercules loan 
the commercial success of solithromycin  taksta and any other product candidates that we develop  if approved in the future  will depend upon attaining significant market acceptance of these products among physicians and payors 
as a company  we have never commercialized a product candidate for any indication 
even if solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidate that we develop is approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale  physicians may not prescribe our approved products  which would prevent us from generating revenues or becoming profitable 
market acceptance of solithromycin  taksta and any other product candidates that we develop by physicians  patients and payors will depend on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the clinical indications for which the product is approved  acceptance by physicians and payors of each product as a safe and effective treatment  the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments  including numerous generic drug products  such as azithromycin  levofloxacin and vancomycin  the relative convenience and ease of administration of solithromycin in the treatment of cabp and taksta in the treatment of prosthetic joint infections  the availability and efficacy of competitive drugs  the effectiveness of our or any third party partner s sales force and marketing efforts  our ability to manufacture or obtain commercial quantities of our drug products  our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis  the extent to which bacteria develop resistance to any antibiotic product candidate that we develop  thereby limiting its efficacy in treating or managing infections  the extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations  whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first line therapy or as a second or third line therapy for particular infections  the availability of adequate reimbursement by third parties  such as insurance companies and other health care payors  and or by government health care programs  including medicare and medicaid  our ability to have our products included in hospital formularies  limitations or warnings contained in a product s fda approved labeling  and prevalence and severity of adverse side effects 
even if the medical community accepts that solithromycin and taksta are safe and efficacious for their approved indications  physicians may not immediately be receptive to the use or may be slow to adopt solithromycin as an accepted treatment for cabp and taksta as an accepted treatment for prosthetic joint infections 
while we believe each of solithromycin and taksta has significant advantages  we cannot assure you that any labeling approved by the fda will permit us to promote solithromycin and taksta as being superior to competing products 
if either or both of solithromycin or taksta are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of 
table of contents acceptance by physicians and payors  we may not generate sufficient or any revenues from these products and we may not become profitable 
in addition  our efforts to educate the medical community and third party payors on the benefits of solithromycin and taksta may require significant resources and may never be successful 
if approved  solithromycin and taksta will face significant competition from branded and generic antibiotics and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
if solithromycin or taksta is approved  we will have competitors both in the us and internationally  including major multinational pharmaceutical companies  established biotechnology companies  specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies 
many of these companies have greater financial and other resources  such as larger research and development staffs and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations 
as a result  these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products 
they also may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in license novel compounds that could make solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates that we develop obsolete 
as a result  our competitors may succeed in commercializing antibiotics before we do 
smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large  established companies 
if approved  both solithromycin and taksta will face competition from currently commercially available antibiotics  as well as any competing products that may be developed in the future 
in july  the united states congress passed  and president obama signed  the food and drug administration safety and innovation act  which included the generating antibiotic incentives now act  or the gain act 
the gain act is intended to provide incentives for the development of new  qualified infectious disease products 
these incentives might result in more competition in the market for new antibiotics and might cause pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with more resources than we have to shift their efforts towards the development of products that could be competitive with our product candidates 
existing approved products that will compete with solithromycin include azithromycin sold under the brand name zithromax by pfizer inc and available as a generic  clarithromycin sold under the brand name biaxin by abbott laboratories and available as a generic  moxifloxacin sold under the brand name avelox by bayer ag  levofloxacin sold under the brand name levaquin by johnson johnson and available as a generic  linezolid sold under the brand name zyvox by pfizer inc  ceftriaxone sold under the brand name rocephin by f 
hoffman la roche ltd and available as a generic and ceftaroline sold under the brand name teflaro by forest laboratories  inc 
existing approved products that will compete with taksta include vancomycin available as a generic  linezolid sold under the brand name zyvox by pfizer inc  daptomycin sold under the brand name cubicin by cubist pharmaceuticals  inc  quinupristin dalfopristin sold under the brand name synercid by sanofi aventis and monarch pharmaceuticals  inc  tigecycline sold under the brand name tygacil by pfizer inc  telavancin sold under the brand name vibativ by theravance  inc and astellas pharma  inc and ceftaroline sold under the brand name teflaro by forest laboratories  inc 
generic antibiotics are typically sold at lower prices than branded antibiotics and are generally preferred by managed care providers of health services 
if we are unable to demonstrate the advantages of solithromycin or taksta over competing drugs and drug candidates  we will not be able to successfully commercialize solithromycin or taksta and our results of operations will suffer 
reimbursement may not be available for solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates that we develop  which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably 
market acceptance and sales of solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by health care reform measures 
government authorities and third party payors  such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations  decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels 
we cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates that we develop 
also  we cannot be sure that the amount of reimbursement available  if any  will not reduce the demand for  or the price of  our products 
if reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels  we may not be able to successfully commercialize solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates that we develop 
specifically  in both the us and some foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
in the us  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  also called the medicare modernization act  or mma  changed the way medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products 
the legislation expanded medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs 
in addition  this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class 
as a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products  we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs 
these cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business 
while the mma applies only to drug benefits for medicare beneficiaries  private payors often follow medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates  and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the mma may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors 

table of contents in march  the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  or collectively  ppaca  became law in the us the goal of ppaca is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers 
while we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically  the ppaca may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement  which could negatively affect market acceptance of solithromycin or taksta or any future products 
earlier this year  members of the us congress and some state legislatures sought to overturn at least portions of the legislation including those on the mandatory purchase of insurance 
however  on june   the united states supreme court upheld the constitutionality of these provisions 
members of the us congress have since proposed a number of legislative initiatives  including possible repeal of the ppaca 
we cannot predict the outcome or impact of current proposals or whether new proposals will be made or adopted  when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us if they are adopted 
the availability of numerous generic antibiotics at lower prices than branded antibiotics  such as solithromycin or taksta if either were approved for commercial introduction  may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for such products 
we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of solithromycin  taksta and any other products that we develop  due to the trend toward managed health care  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals 
if we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so  we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed 
we currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience as a company in marketing drug products 
if we are unable to establish our own marketing and sales capabilities  or enter into agreements with third parties  to market and sell our products after they are approved  we may not be able to generate product revenues 
we do not have a sales organization for the marketing  sales and distribution of any drug products 
in order to commercialize any products  we must develop these capabilities on our own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing  sales and distribution of our products 
the establishment and development of our own sales force would be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch  and we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully develop this capability 
as a result  we may seek one or more licensing partners to handle some or all of the sales and marketing of solithromycin for cabp in the us and elsewhere and taksta for prosthetic joint infections in the us there also may be certain markets within the us for solithromycin for which we may seek a co promotion arrangement 
however  we may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell solithromycin or taksta on favorable terms or at all 
in the event we are unable to develop our own marketing and sales force or collaborate with a third party marketing and sales organization  we would not be able to commercialize solithromycin  taksta or any other product candidates that we develop  which would negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues 
further  whether we commercialize products on our own or rely on a third party to do so  our ability to generate revenue will be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force 
in addition  to the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize our approved products  we will likely receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves 
if we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial  scientific and medical personnel 
in order to induce valuable employees to remain with us  we have provided stock options that vest over time 
the value to employees of stock options will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies 
our scientific team has expertise in many different aspects of drug discovery and development 
we conduct our operations at our facility in chapel hill  north carolina  which is part of the research triangle consisting of raleigh  durham and chapel hill 
this region is headquarters to other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions and  as a result  at any given time there may be a shortage of experienced scientists and medical personnel 
competition for skilled personnel in our area and elsewhere in the us is very intense and competition for experienced scientists may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all 
despite our efforts to retain valuable employees  members of our management  scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice 
we do not have employment agreements with prabhavathi fernandes  our chief executive officer  mark w 
hahn  our chief financial officer or any other employee 
as a result  all employees are employed on an at will basis  which means that any of these employees could leave our employment at any time  with or without notice  and may go to work for a competitor 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled scientific and medical personnel 

table of contents other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources  different risk profiles and longer histories than we do 
they also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement 
some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we offer 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel  our ability to discover  develop and commercialize drug candidates will be limited 
we will need to grow our organization  and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth  which could disrupt our operations 
as of march   we had employees 
as our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop  we expect to expand our employee base for managerial  operational  financial and other resources and  depending on our commercialization strategy  we may further expand our employee base for sales and marketing resources 
future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management  including the need to identify  recruit  maintain  motivate and integrate additional employees 
also  our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from their day to day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities 
we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure  give rise to operational mistakes  loss of business opportunities  loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees 
our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects  such as the development of additional product candidates 
if our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth  our expenses may increase more than expected  our ability to generate and or grow revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy 
our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize solithromycin  taksta and our other product candidates and compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to effectively manage any future growth in our organization 
even if we obtain fda approval of solithromycin  or any other product candidate  we may never obtain approval or commercialize our products outside of the us  which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential 
if foreign approval is obtained  there are risks in conducting business in international markets 
in order to market solithromycin or any other products outside of the us  we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy 
clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries  and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country 
approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods 
seeking foreign regulatory approvals could result in significant delays  difficulties and costs for us and require additional pre clinical studies or clinical trials which would be costly and time consuming 
regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries 
satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly  time consuming  uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays 
in addition  our failure to obtain regulatory approval in the us or any foreign country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries 
we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in the us or any foreign country and we do not have experience as a company in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets 
if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in a foreign country or to obtain and maintain required approvals  our potential market for solithromycin or other products will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed 
we do not intend to commercialize taksta outside the us because of the widespread use of fusidic acid in europe and australia 
if approved for commercialization in a foreign country  we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market solithromycin whenever it may be approved and wherever we have the right to market it 
consequently  we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships  including potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights  the potential for so called parallel importing  which is what happens when a local seller  faced with high or higher local prices  opts to import goods from a foreign market with low or lower prices rather than buying them locally  unexpected changes in tariffs  trade barriers and regulatory requirements  economic weakness  including inflation  or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets  compliance with laws for employees traveling abroad  foreign taxes  including withholding of payroll taxes  foreign currency fluctuations  which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues  
table of contents workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the us  production shortages resulting from any events affecting api and or finished drug product supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad  business interruptions resulting from geo political actions  including war and terrorism  or natural disasters including earthquakes  typhoons  floods and fires  and failure to comply with office of foreign asset control rules and regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act 
these and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain revenue from international markets 
our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities  including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading 
we are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct 
misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with fda regulations  provide accurate information to the fda  comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations  report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us 
in particular  sales  marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud  misconduct  kickbacks  self dealing and other abusive practices 
these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing  discounting  marketing and promotion  sales commission  customer incentive programs and other business arrangements 
employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation 
we have adopted a code of conduct  but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations 
if any such actions are instituted against us  and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights  those actions could have a significant impact on our business  including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions 
we have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have no revenues and have funded our operations to date from the private sale of equity and debt securities and our initial public offering 
we expect to incur substantial additional losses over the next several years as our research  development  pre clinical testing  and clinical trial activities increase  especially those related to solithromycin and taksta 
in addition  we also expect to incur additional costs operating as a public company 
the amount of future losses and when  if ever  we will achieve profitability are uncertain 
to raise additional funds to support our business operations  we may issue equity or debt securities 
debt securities could contain restrictive covenants that may adversely impact the operation of our business 
the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants  such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt  limitations on our ability to acquire  sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 
for example  in august  we issued unsecured convertible notes the august notes in the aggregate principal amount of  the august notes contained restrictive covenants that prohibited us from incurring new indebtedness in excess of million in the aggregate and granting a security interest on any of our material assets without the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the august notes 
pursuant to this authority  the holders of the august notes approved the hercules debt financing that we closed in december the august notes automatically converted into shares of our common stock upon the closing of our ipo and their restrictive covenants terminated at such time 
future debt securities or other financing arrangements could contain similar or more restrictive negative covenants than the august notes 
in addition  the sale of equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock  which would result in dilution to our stockholders 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
we began operations in our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company  conducting product development activities for solithromycin and taksta and performing research and development with respect to our proprietary macrolide library 
we have not yet demonstrated an ability as a company to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize a product candidate 
consequently  the ability to predict our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products 

table of contents risks related to our industry we are subject to extensive and costly government regulation 
antibiotics  including those we are developing and plan to develop in the future  are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the fda  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  other divisions of the us department of health and human services  the us department of justice  state and local governments and their respective foreign equivalents 
the fda regulates the research  development  pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacture  safety  effectiveness  record keeping  reporting  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale  distribution  import and export of pharmaceutical products 
if any products we develop are tested or marketed abroad  they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments  whether or not we have obtained fda approval for a given product and its uses 
such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding us regulation 
government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching  developing  manufacturing and selling products 
our failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant fines or the inability of our product candidates to obtain and maintain regulatory approval  which would have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for solithromycin  taksta or any of our future product candidates  we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties 
even if regulatory approval in the us is obtained  the fda may still impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post approval studies or post market surveillance 
for example  the labeling ultimately approved for solithromycin and or taksta if any  may include restrictions on use 
solithromycin  taksta or any of our other product candidates will also be subject to ongoing fda requirements governing the labeling  packaging  storage  distribution  safety surveillance  advertising  promotion  record keeping and reporting of safety and other post market information 
the holder of an approved nda is subject to obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the nda 
application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product  product labeling or manufacturing process 
application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the fda and report on ongoing clinical trials 
legal requirements have also been enacted to require disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases 
in addition  manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cgmp regulations 
if we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product  such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured  a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product  the manufacturing facility or us  including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing  requiring new warnings or other labeling changes to limit use of the drug  requiring that we conduct additional clinical trials  imposing new monitoring requirements  or requiring that we establish a rems 
advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda rules in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws 
the distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the prescription drug marketing act 
sales  marketing and scientific educational grant programs must comply with the anti fraud and abuse provisions of the social security act  the false claims act and similar state laws  each as amended 
pricing and rebate programs must comply with the medicaid rebate requirements of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of and the veteran s health care act of  each as amended 
if products are made available to authorized users of the federal supply schedule of the general services administration  additional laws and requirements apply 
all of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws 
if we or our third party collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  a regulatory agency may conduct an investigation into our practices and any alleged violation of law  issue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law  seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines  suspend or withdraw regulatory approval  suspend any ongoing clinical trials  refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us  suspend or impose restrictions on operations  including costly new manufacturing requirements  
table of contents seize or detain products  refuse to permit the import or export of products  or require us to initiate a product recall  or refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts  including government contracts 
the occurrence of any event or penalty described above may force us to expend significant amounts of time and money and may significantly inhibit our ability to bring to market or continue to market our products and generate revenues 
similar regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions 
product liability lawsuits could divert our resources  result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products 
we face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates despite obtaining appropriate informed consents from our clinical trial participants  and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize solithromycin or taksta in the us or other additional jurisdictions or if we engage in the clinical testing of new product candidates or commercialize any additional products 
for example  we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing or sale 
any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing  defects in design  a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product  negligence  strict liability or a breach of warranties 
claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates 
even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources 
regardless of the merits or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for our products or product candidates that we may develop  loss of revenue  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  initiation of investigations by regulators  costs to defend the related litigation  a diversion of management s time and our resources  substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients  product recalls  withdrawals or labeling  marketing or promotional restrictions  exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources  the inability to commercialize our products or product candidates  and a decline in our stock price 
although we maintain general liability insurance of up to million in the aggregate and clinical trial liability insurance of million in the aggregate for each of solithromycin and taksta  this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities 
the cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
in addition  inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our products  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
if we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law  we may be liable for damages 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances  including chemical  biological and radioactive materials and viruses 
in addition  our operations produce hazardous waste products 
federal  state and local laws and regulations in the us govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
although we believe that our procedures for use  handling  storing and disposing of these materials all of which only occur at third party sites operated by our contractors comply with legally prescribed standards  we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future 
we also cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations  or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced 
also  even if we are in compliance with applicable laws  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials  and we may incur liability as a result of any such contamination or injury 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines  and the liability could exceed our resources  and we do not carry liability insurance 
table of contents covering the use of hazardous materials 
if we fail to comply with applicable requirements  we could incur substantial costs  including civil or criminal fines and penalties  clean up costs  or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve or maintain compliance 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development and production efforts  which adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
risks related to our intellectual property our ability to pursue the development and commercialization of solithromycin depends upon the continuation of our licenses from optimer and tsri 
our agreement with optimer provides us with a worldwide exclusive license to develop and sell solithromycin outside of asean countries 
we are obligated to use our diligent efforts to develop and commercialize products licensed from optimer 
we have other obligations to optimer under the license related to progress reporting  payment terms and confidentiality 
if we are unable to make the required milestone and royalty payments under the agreement  if we do not continue to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize solithromycin or if we otherwise materially breach the agreement  our rights to develop and commercialize solithromycin would terminate and revert to optimer 
in addition  either we or optimer may terminate the agreement upon the uncured material breach of the agreement 
if our agreement with optimer is terminated by optimer  we would lose our rights to develop and commercialize solithromycin  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
our agreement with tsri provides us with a license to make  use  sell  and import products for human or animal therapeutic use that use or incorporate one or more macrolides as an active pharmaceutical ingredient and is covered by certain patent rights owned by tsri claiming technology related to copper catalysed ligation of azides and acetylenes  with exclusive rights as to the people s republic of china excluding hong kong  south korea and australia  and non exclusive rights in all other countries worldwide  except the member nations of the association of southeast asian nations which are not included in the license with tsri 
we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals to market and sell one or more licensed products 
tsri may terminate the agreement due to our insolvency  our conviction for a felony relating to the development  manufacture  use  marketing  distribution or sale of a licensed product  or upon an uncured breach of the agreement by us  including failure to make any required payment 
if our agreement with tsri is terminated by tsri  we could lose our rights to synthesize and or manufacture solithromycin under the licensed tsri technology  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
another party could develop a fusidic acid product and achieve fda regulatory exclusivity in the us before we do  potentially preventing our ability to commercialize taksta 
we will rely partly on fda regulatory exclusivity to protect our proprietary rights for taksta  our fusidic acid product  in the us fusidic acid has been approved and sold for several decades in europe and other countries outside the us  but it has never been approved in the us we believe this was due to the lack of regulatory exclusivity that was available for the molecule until the passage of public law on october   which allowed old antibiotics such as fusidic acid to obtain five year new chemical entity  or nce  exclusivity upon nda approval 
this exclusivity will be granted to the first fusidic acid product that receives nda approval 
during the exclusivity period  the fda will not accept an application filed by a third party that relies on any data contained in the approved nda 
although we are not aware of another party currently developing fusidic acid for use in the us for any indication  if another party were to do so and obtain nda approval before we do  we would not be able to obtain approval for taksta for any disease until after any period of regulatory exclusivity if our nda relies on data contained in the previously approved nda 
in that event  we may not be able to commercialize taksta  which would harm our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability 
our competitive position may be harmed if a competitor obtains orphan drug exclusivity for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections before we do 
even if we were to obtain orphan drug exclusivity  a competitor could obtain approval of a different drug for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections or for the same drug upon a showing that its drug is clinically superior to ours  which would harm our business 
orphan drug designation is an important element of our competitive strategy for taksta 
the company that obtains the first fda approval for a drug that is designated as an orphan drug for a rare disease receives a type of marketing exclusivity known as orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity prevents fda approval of applications by others for the same drug and the designated orphan disease or condition for seven years from the date of nda approval 
if the orphan indication is the first nda approved for the drug  the drug is also eligible for the five year hatch waxman exclusivity for nces 
orphan and hatch waxman exclusivities run concurrently 

table of contents the fda may approve a subsequent application from another entity for the orphan indication of prosthetic joint infections if it determines that the application is for a different drug 
the fda may also approve a subsequent application for fusidic acid for an indication other than prosthetic joint infections 
orphan exclusivity does not block the same drug from being approved for another indication  however  hatch waxman exclusivity could block an nda submission for a period of five years after approval if the subsequent application referenced data in the earlier nda 
the fda may approve a subsequent application from another entity for the same drug for the same designated and approved orphan indication during the orphan exclusivity period if it determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior  or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public s need 
if we do not receive orphan exclusivity for taksta for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections  our business would be negatively affected 
in addition  even if we do obtain orphan exclusivity for taksta  the fda may permit other companies to market other drugs for the same condition or use 
in addition  the fda may approve another fusidic acid product for prosthetic joint infections during our period of orphan drug exclusivity if it can be demonstrated that the drug is clinically superior to our drug  or if we are unable to supply sufficient product to meet the public s need 
this could create a more competitive market for us 
if our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to solithromycin  taksta  and our other product candidates are not adequate  we may not be able to compete effectively in our market 
our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent position as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for solithromycin  taksta and any future products in the us and other countries 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have  which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain 
the legal principles applicable to patents are in transition due to changing court precedent and legislative action and we cannot assure you that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future 
changes in patent laws in the us such as the america invents act of may affect the scope  strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by us related to our patent rights 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us  and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies  solithromycin  taksta and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
these risks include the possibility that the patent applications that we licensed or have filed on our own may fail to result in issued patents in the us or in foreign countries  patents issued or licensed to us or our partners may be challenged  discovered to have been issued on the basis of insufficient or incorrect information and or held to be invalid or unenforceable  the scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude other competitors from developing or designing around these patents  we or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications  we or our licensors were not the first to file patent applications for these inventions  we may fail to comply with procedural  documentary  fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process  which can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application  resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights  future product candidates may not be patentable  others will claim rights or ownership with regard to patents and other proprietary rights which we hold or license  delays in development  testing  clinical trials and regulatory review may reduce the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection  and we may fail to timely apply for patents on our technologies or products 
while we apply for patents covering both our technologies and potential products  including solithromycin and taksta  as we deem appropriate  many biopharmaceutical companies and university and research institutions already have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development 
these entities applications  patents and other intellectual property rights may conflict with patent applications to which we have rights and could prevent us from obtaining patents or could call into 
table of contents question the validity of any of our patents  if issued  or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop  manufacture or commercialize antibiotic candidates 
in addition  if third parties file patent applications in the technologies that also claim technology to which we have rights  we may have to participate in interference  derivation or other proceedings with the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  or applicable foreign patent regulatory authorities  as applicable  to determine our rights in the invention  which may be time consuming and expensive 
moreover  issued patents may be challenged during post grant proceedings brought by a third party or the uspto  or in foreign countries  or in the courts 
these proceedings may result in loss of patent claims or adverse changes to the scope of the claims 
if we or our licensors or partners fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates  or our proprietary technologies and their uses  companies may be dissuaded from collaborating with us 
in such event  our ability to commercialize solithromycin  taksta and our other product candidates may be threatened  we could lose our competitive advantage and the competition we face could increase  all of which could adversely affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
if we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties  litigation will be costly and time consuming and could prevent us or delay us from developing or commercializing our product candidates 
our commercial success depends  in part  on our not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any collaboration or other agreements we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products 
numerous third party us and us issued patents and pending applications exist in the areas of antibacterial treatment  including compounds  formulations  treatment methods and synthetic processes that may be applied towards the synthesis of antibiotics 
although no legal action has been commenced or threatened against us by a third party for infringing intellectual property rights  we cannot provide assurances that we or our partners will be free to manufacture or market our product candidates as planned  or that we or our licensors and partners patents will not be opposed or litigated by third parties 
we are currently negotiating a license with a third party for technology used in our manufacturing process for solithromycin 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain a license to such patent on favorable terms or at all 
failure to obtain such license may have a material adverse effect on our business 
there is a substantial amount of litigation involving intellectual property in the biopharmaceutical industry generally 
if a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights  we could face a number of risks that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects  including infringement and other intellectual property claims  which would be costly and time consuming to defend  whether or not we are ultimately successful  which in turn could delay the regulatory approval process  consume our capital and divert management s attention from our business  substantial damages for past infringement  which we may have to pay if a court determines that our products or technologies infringe a competitor s patent or other proprietary rights  a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies or future products unless the third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms  which it is not required to do  if a license is available from a third party  we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license  and redesigning our products so they do not infringe  which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time 
although we are not currently party to any legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property  in the future  third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies  processes or products infringe on their intellectual property 
we cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our partners or against the licensors of technology licensed to us  or whether those claims will harm our business 
in addition  the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance 
if we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our product candidates  an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties  and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our product candidates  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
we may be required to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors  which could be expensive and time consuming 
competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors 
to counter infringement or unauthorized use  we may be required to file infringement claims  which can be expensive and time consuming 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims  which typically last for years before they are concluded 
the legal systems of certain countries  particularly certain developing countries  do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection  particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals  which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally 

table of contents in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents  or those of our licensors  do not cover the technology in question 
an adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents  or those of our licensors  at risk of being invalidated  held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications  or those of our licensors  at risk of not issuing 
moreover  we may not be able to prevent  alone or with our licensors  misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the us furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
in addition  if securities analysts or investors perceive public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments to be negative  the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
the occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
the intellectual property protection for our products is dependent on third parties 
with respect to patent applications relating to solithromycin or other compounds licensed from optimer  optimer retains rights in asean countries 
generally  we do not have the right to prosecute and maintain any applications in those countries  unless optimer elects not to file  prosecute or maintain any or all of such patents 
our potential future licensors also may retain the right to prosecute and maintain the patent rights that they license to us 
if optimer or other licensors fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for any of our product candidates in those countries controlled by them  our ability to develop and commercialize those products may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making  using and selling competing products in those countries 
with respect to inventions that are jointly made by us and one of our licensors  partners or potential partners  we would need to determine  with our licensors  partners or potential partners  who would be responsible for the prosecution of patents relating to any joint inventions should they arise 
in addition  we may be required to cede control of prosecution of our patents to partners or potential partners in order to consummate a partnering transaction 
if any of our licensors or partners fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for any of our product candidates in those countries controlled by them  our ability to develop and commercialize those products may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making  using and selling competing products in those countries 
if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of certain information  the value of our products and technology could be materially adversely affected 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position 
to protect this competitive position  we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties  including employees  independent contractors  suppliers and collaborators 
we cannot  however  ensure that these protective arrangements will be honored by third parties  and we may not have adequate remedies if these arrangements are breached 
in addition  enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets  know how and technological advancements is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
non us courts are sometimes less willing than us courts to protect this information 
moreover  our trade secrets  know how and technological advancements may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in a manner providing us with no practical recourse against the competing parties 
if any such events were to occur  they could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
we have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets  and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business 
the uspto has allowed our trademark applications for our mark taksta  and  if we submit statements of use to the uspto in a timely manner  the uspto will issue trademark registrations  subject to unforeseen circumstances that arise 
although we are not currently aware of any oppositions to or cancellations of our registered trademarks or pending applications  it is possible that one or more of the applications could be subject to opposition or cancellation after the marks are registered 
the registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements 
we have not yet registered all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets and there are names or symbols other than cempra that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration 
failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that opposition or cancellation proceedings will not be filed against our trademarks or that our trademarks would survive such proceedings 

table of contents we may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 
as is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
we may be subject to claims that these employees  or we  have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
such claims may lead to material costs for us  or an inability to protect or use valuable intellectual property rights  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
risks related to ownership of our common stock an active trading market for our common stock may not develop to provide our stockholders with adequate liquidity 
prior to february   there had not been a public market for our common stock 
since that time  our common stock has been thinly traded 
we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop  or if it does develop  it may not be maintained 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active 
we might not be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
our common stock began listing on the nasdaq global market on february   under the symbol cemp 
we might not be able to maintain the listing standards of that exchange 
if we fail to maintain the listing requirements  our common stock might trade on the nasdaq capital market  or move to the otc bulletin board or in the pink sheets maintained by pink otc markets  inc the otc bulletin board and the pink sheets are generally considered to be markets that are less efficient and less broad than the nasdaq capital market 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our stock began trading on the nasdaq global market on february  between that date and march   it has traded between and 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  which include any delay in commencement of our planned phase clinical trial for iv to oral solithromycin or our phase clinical trials for taksta  adverse results or delays in clinical trials  any delay in filing our ndas for solithromycin or taksta and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the fda s review of the ndas  including without limitation the fda s issuance of a refusal to file letter or a request for additional information  changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or product candidates  including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals  unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of solithromycin  taksta or any of our other product candidates  a decision to initiate a clinical trial  not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial  the inability to obtain adequate product supply for solithromycin  taksta or any other approved drug product  or the inability to do so at acceptable prices  adverse regulatory decisions  the introduction of new products or technologies offered by us or our competitors  the effectiveness of our or our potential partners commercialization efforts  the inability to effectively manage our growth  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  the failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community  the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public  legislatures  regulators and the investment community  the overall performance of the us equity markets and general political and economic conditions  developments concerning our sources of manufacturing supply and any commercialization partners  
table of contents announcements of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors  disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights  including patents  litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies  additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel  adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future  sales of our common stock by our stockholders in the future  significant lawsuits  including patent or stockholder litigation  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  the trading volume of our common stock  effects of natural or man made catastrophic events or other business interruptions  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the stock of biotechnology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval 
at february   our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with certain of our directors beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding voting common stock 
therefore  these stockholders have the ability to influence us through their ownership position 
these stockholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval 
for example  these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors  amendments of our organizational documents  or approval of any merger  sale of assets  or other major corporate transaction 
this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 
the requirements of being a public company adds to our operating costs and might strain our resources and distract our management 
we became a public company on february  as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company 
the sarbanes oxley act of  or the sarbanes oxley act  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the nasdaq global market have imposed various requirements on public companies 
while we may opt to rely on certain exemptions from these requirements provided in the jumpstart our business startups act of  or the jobs act  our management and other personnel still need to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives 
moreover  we anticipate that compliance with certain rules and regulations will increase our legal  accounting and financial compliance costs substantially 
we estimate the additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements to range from million to million annually  although unforeseen circumstances could increase actual costs 
in addition  these rules and regulations may make our activities related to legal  accounting and financial compliance more difficult  time consuming and costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel  systems and resources 
if these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth will make our common stock less attractive to investors or otherwise negatively impact the price of our stock 
the jobs act contains provisions that  among other things  reduce reporting requirements for qualifying companies 
as an emerging growth company  we evaluate the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the jobs act 
subject to certain conditions set forth in the jobs act  as an emerging growth company  we have chosen to rely on these exemptions  and as a result  we are not required to  among other things  i provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act  ii provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non emerging growth public companies under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  iii comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board  or pcaob  regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the 
table of contents audit and the financial statements auditor discussion and analysis  and disclose executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the ceo s compensation to median employee compensation 
these exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering  or ipo  on february  or until we otherwise no longer satisfy the criteria to be an emerging growth company  whichever is earlier 
we cannot be certain if our scaled disclosure will make our stock less attractive to investors or negatively affect the price of our stock 
if we fail to establish and maintain proper internal controls  our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired 
sec rules that implement section of the sarbanes oxley act require us to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose 
we first became subject to this requirement for this report 
while we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december   there can be no assurance that we will be able to so conclude in the future or that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls in connection with future evaluations 
additionally  we have opted to rely on the exemptions provided in the jobs act  and will not be required to provide our independent auditor s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting until such time we cease to be an emerging growth company  which  at the latest  would be for our annual report on form k for the year ending december  investors may lose confidence in our operating results  our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions if i in the future we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  ii we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  which could result in financial statement errors which  in turn  could require us to restate our operating results or iii when required  our independent auditors are unwilling or unable to provide us with an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
any of these events could cause investors to lose confidence in our operating results  our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 
in addition  if we are unable to meet the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  we may not be able to remain listed on the nasdaq global market 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline 
certain holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration under the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act  of shares of our common stock or shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants held by these individuals or entities 
registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act  except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in rule under the securities act 
sales of stock by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
a limited number of securities and industry analysts currently publish research on our company 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  referred to as the internal revenue code  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period  the corporation s ability to use its pre change net operating loss carry forwards and other pre change tax attributes such as research tax credits to offset its post change income may be limited 
we believe that  with the financing transactions that have occurred over the past three years  we may have triggered an ownership change limitation 
we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership 
as a result  if we earn net taxable income  our ability to use our pre change net operating loss carry forwards to offset us federal taxable income may be subject to limitations  which potentially could result in increased future tax liability to us 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock 

table of contents we have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock 
we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development  operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
any return to stockholders will be limited to the value of their stock 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the hercules loan  for as long as the hercules loan is outstanding  we may not pay any cash dividends on our common stock 
some provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may have anti takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us  even if an acquisition would benefit our stockholders  and could also make it more difficult to remove our current management 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval  limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders  creating a staggered board of directors  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings 
these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management 
in addition  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder  unless such transactions are approved by the board of directors 
this provision could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing someone from acquiring us or merging with us  whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders 
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors 
we discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing antibiotics to meet critical medical needs in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases  particularly respiratory tract infections and chronic and acute staphylococcal infections 
our lead program  solithromycin  which we are developing in both oral and iv formulations initially for the treatment of cabp  one of the most serious infections of the respiratory tract  recently initiated a pivotal phase clinical trial of the oral formulation for the treatment of cabp in a global multi center double blinded study 
we have also released data from a phase study of solithromycin in uncomplicated gonorrhea 
our second program is taksta  which we are developing in the us as an oral treatment for prosthetic joint infections caused by s 
aureus  including mrsa 
in december  we initiated a phase trial for taksta in patients with prosthetic joint infections 
we acquired worldwide rights exclusive of asean countries to a library of over macrolide compounds  including solithromycin  from optimer in march we entered into a long term supply arrangement with ercros in march  pursuant to which we have the exclusive right to acquire fusidic acid for the production of taksta 
we believe ercros is one of only two currently known manufacturers that can produce fusidic acid compliant with the purity required for human use 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our drug development efforts  including conducting clinical trials of our product candidates  protecting our intellectual property and providing general and administrative support for these operations 
we do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from any source 
from inception in november through december   we raised a total of million from the issuance of debt  sale of convertible notes  convertible preferred shares  common shares and common stock  including million from the sale of common stock in our ipo in february and million from the sale of common stock in a private placement in october we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in november our net losses were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
substantially all of our operating losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we initiate or continue our clinical trials of solithromycin and taksta and our other product candidates  operate as a public company  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials  build appropriate manufacturing facilities for the manufacture of  or outsource the manufacture of  any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval  establish our own sales force  or contract with third parties  for the sales  marketing and distribution of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval  maintain  expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio  continue our other research and development efforts  hire additional clinical  quality control  scientific and management personnel  and add operational  financial and management information systems and personnel  including personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts 
we do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates  which we expect will take a number of years and is subject to significant uncertainty 
accordingly  we will need to raise additional capital prior to the commercialization of solithromycin and taksta or any of our other product candidates 
until such time  if ever  as we can generate substantial product revenue  we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings  debt financings  marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations  strategic alliances and licensing arrangements 
however  we may be unable to raise additional funds when needed on favorable terms or at all 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidates 

table of contents our board of directors approved a for reverse stock split of our common and preferred shares on january   which became effective on january  all references to common stock  common shares outstanding  average number of common shares outstanding and per share amounts in our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the for reverse stock split on a retroactive basis 
financial overview revenue to date  we have not generated revenue from the sale of any products or from any other source 
in the future  we anticipate generating revenue from a combination of sales of our products  if approved  whether through our own or a third party sales force  and license fees  milestone payments and royalties in connection with strategic collaborations regarding any of our product candidates 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
if we or our strategic partners fail to complete the development of solithromycin or taksta in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them  or if we fail to develop our own sales force or find one or more strategic partners for the commercialization of approved products  our ability to generate future revenue  and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
research and development expenses since our inception  we have focused our resources on our research and development activities  including conducting pre clinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings for our product candidates 
we recognize our research and development expenses as they are incurred 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  which include salaries  benefits and share compensation expense  for personnel in research and development functions  fees paid to consultants and clinical research organizations  or cros  in connection with our clinical trials  and other related clinical trial costs  such as for investigator grants  patient screening  laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis  costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials  costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements  consulting fees paid to third parties related to non clinical research and development  research supplies  and license fees and milestone payments related to in licensed technologies 
from inception through december   we have incurred million in research and development expenses 
we plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to complete development of solithromycin for cabp and taksta for prosthetic joint infections and to further advance our other product candidates 
our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs  such as fees paid to investigators  consultants  central laboratories and cros in connection with our clinical trials  and related clinical trial fees 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across multiple projects 
through our clinical development programs  we are advancing solithromycin and taksta in parallel primarily for the treatment of cabp and prosthetic joint infections  respectively  as well as for other indications 
through our pre clinical development programs  we are seeking to develop macrolide product candidates for non antibacterial indications 
the following table sets forth costs incurred on a program specific basis for solithromycin and taksta  excluding personnel related costs 
macrolide research includes costs for discovery programs 
all employee related expenses for those employees working in research and development functions are included in research and development payroll in the table  including salary  bonus  employee benefits and share based compensation 
we do not allocate insurance or other indirect costs related to our research and development function to specific product candidates 
those expenses are included in indirect research and development expense in the table 

table of contents year ended december  in thousands direct research and development expense by program solithromycin taksta macrolide research research and development personnel cost total direct research and development expense indirect research and development expense total research and development expense the successful development of our clinical and pre clinical product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate the nature  timing or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of any of our clinical or pre clinical product candidates or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows from these product candidates may commence 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our ongoing  as well as any additional  clinical trials and other research and development activities  future clinical trial results  and the timing of regulatory approvals 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
we have begun our pivotal trial program for solithromycin  which we believe will require two phase trials  including one trial with oral solithromycin and one trial with iv solithromycin stepping down to oral solithromycin 
both of these trials will be randomized  double blinded studies conducted against a comparator drug agreed upon with the fda  for which we will have to show non inferiority from an efficacy perspective and acceptable safety and tolerability 
using feedback received from the fda  we began the phase trial with oral solithromycin in december we plan to have an end of phase meeting with the fda in the first half of and initiate the iv to oral phase study in the second half of  depending on funds being available 
in  we successfully completed a phase clinical trial with taksta in absssi patients 
in this trial  the taksta loading dose regimen demonstrated efficacy  safety and tolerability that was comparable to linezolid 
like absssi  prosthetic joint infections are often caused by s 
aureus  including mrsa 
at this time  however  we do not intend to pursue taksta as a treatment for absssi 
in december  we initiated a phase trial of taksta in patients with prosthetic joint infections 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs  including share based compensation  for employees in executive  operational  finance and human resources functions 
other significant general and administrative expenses include professional fees for accounting  legal  and information technology services  facilities costs  and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase with the continued development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and as we operate as a public company 
we believe that these increases will likely include increased costs for director and officer liability insurance  costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and increased fees for outside consultants  lawyers and accountants 
we also expect to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance  internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies 
other income expense  net interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and equivalents as well as changes in fair value of warrants issued in connection with the august notes 
we expect our interest income to decrease as we fund the development of our programs 

table of contents interest expense in consisted primarily of non cash interest costs related to changes in the fair value of our class c purchase option described below 
interest expense in consists of interest accrued under the august notes and the hercules loan as described below 
interest expense in consists of interest accrued and paid under the hercules loan as described below as well as changes in fair value of warrants issued in connection with the hercules warrant agreement as described below 
in august  we issued unsecured convertible notes  referred to as the august notes  in the original aggregate principal amount of million 
the august notes bore interest at a rate of per annum  originally were to mature on august  and precluded us from incurring any other debt in excess of million or granting a security interest in any of our assets without the consent of the noteholders 
this restriction was revised by our shareholders in connection with the hercules loan discussed below in december also in connection with the hercules loan  in december  we and the holders of the august notes agreed to extend the maturity dates of the august notes to may  we did not record any gain or loss in connection with the extension of the maturity date of the august notes because we determined that the extension of the maturity date of the august notes met the criteria of a troubled debt restructuring outlined in asc topic  troubled debt restructurings 
the august notes converted into shares of common stock in connection with the ipo completed in february additionally  we granted warrants to the holders of the august notes  which  after completion of the ipo in february  became exercisable for shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to the ipo price of 
in december  we entered into a million loan and security agreement with hercules technology growth capital  inc  or hercules referred to as the december note  pursuant to which we borrowed million upon closing 
the principal amount outstanding under the initial million advance bears interest at the greater of i  or ii the sum of plus the prime lending rate  as published by the wall street journal  minus per annum 
prior to october   we had the ability to request an additional advance in the amount of million 
we elected not to request the additional borrowing and let the option expire 
we will be required to make interest only payments through march  which can be extended to june  upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
principal and interest payments will start after march  or any later extended date 
the principal balance outstanding on the loan agreement and all accrued but unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable on december  in addition  on the earliest to occur of i the loan maturity date  ii the date that we prepay all of the outstanding advances and accrued interest  or iii the date that all of the advances and interest become due and payable  we must pay hercules a fee of  we granted hercules a security interest in all of our assets  except for our intellectual property 
our obligations to hercules include restrictions on borrowing  asset transfers  placing liens or security interests on our assets  including our intellectual property  mergers and acquisitions and distributions to stockholders 
in connection with the loan agreement  we entered into a warrant agreement with hercules  under which hercules has the right to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the exercise price per share is equal to per share  subject to adjustment in the event of a merger  reclassification  subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend and subject also to antidilution protection 
the warrant expires on december  proceeds equal to the fair value of the warrants was recorded as a liability at the date of issuance and the borrowings under the hercules loan will be increased to equal the face amount of the borrowings plus interest through interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
each period up to our ipo  we marked to market the warrant and any changes in fair value were recorded in other income expense 
in connection with closing of the first tranche of our class c redeemable convertible preferred share financing in  the investors had the option to purchase a pro rata amount of class c preferred shares in the second tranche at any time prior to the earlier of the closing of the second tranche or september  in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity  we allocated million of the class c proceeds to the fair value of this purchase option  referred to as the class c purchase option  and recorded it as a liability at the closing of the first tranche of class c preferred shares 
at each reporting period and immediately prior to conversion  any change in the fair value of the class c purchase option was recorded as interest expense or income 
we measured the fair value of the class c purchase option based upon contemporaneous valuations and utilized the black scholes option pricing model at each balance sheet date 
the class c purchase option was automatically exercised for class c preferred shares at the time of the closing of the second tranche of our class c preferred share offering in april and  accordingly  the class c purchase option was converted to class c preferred shares 
we also reported other income of million during the year ended december  due to our receipt of a qualifying therapeutic discovery project tax credit in this amount pursuant to section d of the internal revenue code 
we did not have any other items of other income or expense during the years ended december  and accretion of redeemable preferred shares our redeemable convertible preferred shares were initially recorded on our balance sheet at their cost  less associated issuance costs 
the amount reflected on the balance sheet for our convertible preferred shares is increased by periodic accretion so that the amount reflected on the balance sheet will equal the aggregate redemption price at the redemption date 
from inception through february  the date of our ipo  we have recorded cumulative accretion related to share issuance costs of million 

table of contents yield was cumulative and payable to the holders of preferred shares in advance of any distributions on common shares but only when  if and as declared by our board of directors 
the holders of class c preferred shares had been earning an annual yield at a rate of of the original purchase price since may  through may   the holders of class a preferred shares and class b preferred shares earned an annual yield at a rate of of the original purchase price 
from inception through february  the date of our ipo  we recorded cumulative yield of million through periodic accretions which increase the carrying value of the preferred shares and is charged against additional paid in capital to the extent available or shareholders equity deficit 
the class c holders had the right and option  after the fifth anniversary of the original issue date  or may   by a vote of of the class c holders including at least one of two specified holders  to require us to redeem the class c shares at a redemption price equal to the original price per share plus all cumulative and undeclared yield 
if the class c holders had elected to redeem their shares  the class a and class b holders would have had the right and option  by a vote of holders of two thirds of the class a and class b shares  voting together as a single class  to require us to redeem the class a and class b shares at a redemption price equal to the original price per share plus all cumulative and undeclared dividends 
all of our outstanding preferred shares converted into shares of common stock upon the completion of our ipo in february critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses and share based compensation  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements and such policies have been reviewed and discussed with our audit committee 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with applicable vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to cros in connection with pre clinical or clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  milestone payments  and unpaid salaries  wages and benefits 
we accrue our expenses related to clinical trials based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and cros that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
we do not currently anticipate the future settlement of existing accruals to differ materially from our estimates 
valuation of financial instruments purchase option liability we accounted for our class c purchase option in accordance with fasb asc topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity  which requires that a financial instrument  other than an outstanding share  that  at inception  includes an obligation to repurchase the issuer s equity regardless of the timing or likelihood of the redemption  shall be classified as a liability 
we measured the fair value of the class c purchase option based upon contemporaneous valuations and utilized the black scholes option pricing model at each balance sheet date 
we recorded changes in fair value of the class c purchase option as interest income or expense 

table of contents the significant assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of the class c purchase option included the strike price  estimated volatility  risk free interest rate  estimated fair value of the class c preferred shares  and the estimated life of the class c purchase option 
these assumptions were used to establish an expected set of cash flows which were probability weighted and present valued to determine a fair value 
the class c purchase option was automatically exercised for class c preferred shares at the time of the closing of the second tranche of our class c preferred share offering in april and  accordingly  the class c purchase option liability was converted to class c preferred shares 
liability classified warrants in connection with the issuance of the august notes  we issued warrants  referred to as the august warrants  that have a term of seven years 
the august warrants gave holders the right to purchase a certain number of our shares or securities at a specified exercise price respective to the first of the following scenarios to occur i a company or subsidiary sale as defined in the august warrants  ii maturity of the august notes  iii a qualified private financing  or qpf  or iv an initial public offering 
upon either a company or subsidiary sale or upon maturity of the august notes  the august warrants were convertible into the number of class c preferred shares equal to of the principal amount of the august notes divided by the class c conversion price 
upon either a qpf or a initial public offering  the august warrants were convertible into the number of either the qpf or ipo securities equal to of the principal amount of the august notes divided by either the price per share of the securities issued in the qpf or the offering price of our common shares or equivalent security in the ipo  respectively 
upon completion of our ipo on february   the warrants became exercisable for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the fair value of the warrants was determined using a black scholes model 
the valuation of warrants is subjective and is affected by changes in inputs to the valuation model including the price per share of our common stock  the historical volatility of the stock prices of our peer group  risk free rates based on us treasury security yields  the expected term of the warrants and our dividend yield 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we continued to classify the estimated fair value of the warrants as a liability until the completion of our ipo when the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
in connection with the  loan and security agreement with hercules under which we borrowed  upon closing on december   we entered into a warrant agreement with hercules  under which hercules has the right to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of subject to adjustment in the event of a merger  reclassification  subdivision or combination of shares or stock dividend and subject also to antidilution protection 
the warrant expires on december  proceeds equal to the fair value of the warrants will be recorded as a liability at the date of issuance and the borrowings under the hercules loan will be increased to equal the face amount of the borrowings plus interest through interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
the fair value of the hercules warrants is determined using a binomial model 
the valuation of warrants is subjective and is affected by changes in inputs to the valuation model including the price per share of our common stock  the historical volatility of the stock prices of our peer group  risk free rates based on us treasury security yields  the expected term of the warrants and our dividend yield 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we will continue to classify the estimated fair value of the hercules warrant as a liability and record changes in fair value in other income expense 
share based compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic  stock compensation  as modified or supplemented  we measure compensation cost for share based payment awards granted to employees and non employee directors at fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period for awards expected to vest 
share based compensation cost related to share based payment awards granted to non employees is adjusted each reporting period for changes in the fair value of our shares until the measurement date 
the measurement date is generally considered to be the date when all services have been rendered or the date that options are fully vested 

table of contents share based compensation expense includes options granted to employees and non employees and has been reported in our statements of operations as follows year ended december  in thousands research and development general and administrative total we calculate the fair value of share based compensation awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions  including share price volatility  the expected life of options  risk free interest rate and the fair value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant 
in developing our assumptions  we take into account the following we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common share price 
we calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available 
for the purpose of identifying peer companies  we consider characteristics such as industry  length of trading history  similar vesting terms and in the money option status 
we plan to continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common shares is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants  we determine the risk free interest rate by reference to implied yields available from us treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant  the assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future  we determine the average expected life of options based on the mid point between the vesting date and the contractual term  and we estimate forfeitures based on our historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model for the years ended december    and are set forth below year ended december  employees non employees employees non employees employees non employees volatility n a risk free interest rate n a expected dividend yield n a expected life of options in years n a the following table presents the grant dates  number of underlying shares and related exercise prices of options granted to employees and non employees  including non employee directors  from january  through december   as well as the estimated fair value of the options and the underlying common shares on the grant date 

table of contents date of grant number of shares subject to options granted exercise price per share estimated fair value per common share at grant date reassessed fair market value per common share february  february  july  december  march  the estimated fair value per common share in the table above represents the determination by our board of directors of the fair value of our common shares as of the date of grant  taking into consideration various objective and subjective factors  including the conclusions of valuations of our common shares  as discussed below 
due to the absence of an active market for our common shares  the fair value of our common shares for purposes of determining the exercise price for option grants was determined in good faith by our board of directors  with the assistance and upon the recommendation of management  based on a number of objective and subjective factors consistent with the methodologies outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  referred to as the aicpa practice aid  including the common shares underlying the option involved illiquid securities in a private company  the prices of our class a  class b and class c preferred shares sold by us primarily to outside investors in arm s length transactions  and the rights  preferences and privileges of the preferred shares relative to the common shares  our results of operations  financial position and the status of our research and development efforts  including the status of clinical trials for our product candidates under development  the composition of  and changes to  our management team and board of directors  the material risks related to our business  our business strategy  achievement of enterprise milestones  including the results of clinical trials and our entry into or termination of collaboration and license agreements  the market performance of publicly traded companies in the life sciences and biotechnology sectors  and recently completed mergers and acquisitions of companies comparable to us  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the holders of our common shares and options  such as  an initial public offering given prevailing market conditions  external market conditions affecting the life sciences and biotechnology industry sectors  and contemporaneous valuations of our common shares prepared by independent third party consultants 
option grants in february our board of directors granted options on february  and on february   with each option having an exercise price of per share 
in establishing this exercise price  in addition to the objective and subjective factors discussed above  our board of directors also considered input from management  as well as the most recent available common share valuation as of may  pursuant to the may  contemporaneous valuation  the fair value of our common shares was determined to be per share 
in the may  contemporaneous valuation  the two market approaches used to determine the fair market value of our equity were the direct market data method and a limited guideline public company analysis 
estimates from these methods were then utilized within an income approach  the discounted future returns model 
for purposes of the discounted future returns method  our estimated future revenues from the sale or licensing of product candidates and earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization or ebitda were estimated for  the period which a liquidity event was expected 
once the fair market 
table of contents value of our equity was determined  it was allocated among our preferred and common shares outstanding using the probability weighted expected return method  or pwerm 
under the pwerm approach  share value is derived from the probability weighted present value of expected future investment returns  considering each of the possible outcomes available to us  as well as the economic and control rights of each share class 
the fair value of our common shares was estimated using a probability weighted analysis of the present value of the returns afforded to common shareholders under two future shareholder exit or liquidity event scenarios an initial public offering  or ipo  and a private sale to a larger private or public company 
in the may  contemporaneous valuation  a probability weighting was used for each exit event scenario 
the probability weightings assigned to the respective exit scenarios were primarily based on consideration of our various drug development programs  industry clinical success rates  our expected near term and long term funding requirements  and an assessment of the current financing and biotechnology industry environments at the time of the valuation 
the expected timing of either of these exit events occurring was years from the valuation date 
in the may  contemporaneous valuation  we applied a discount for lack of marketability of to reflect the fact that our common shares represented a minority interest in our company and there was no market mechanism to sell these shares 
a common shareholder would have to wait for a liquidity event such as an ipo or a sale of our company to enable the sale of the common shares 
we used an option pricing model to determine the value of this lack of marketability 
we also applied an additional discount to reflect the incremental risk from both scientific and financial risk factors 
the board of directors then determined that the events and circumstances that occurred between may  and february did not indicate a significant change in the fair value of our common shares during that period 
the additional specific facts and circumstances considered by our board of directors for the february valuations included the following the second tranche of our class c redeemable preferred share financing was anticipated to close in the first half of  and two newly elected directors joined our board of directors 
based on all of these factors  our board of directors determined that the fair value of our common shares at both february  and february  was per share 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we reassessed the fair value of our common shares for financial reporting purposes at february  and february  and determined that no adjustment was necessary 
option grants on july  our board of directors granted options on july  with each option having an exercise price of per share 
in establishing this exercise price  in addition to the objective and subjective factors discussed above  our board of directors also considered input from management  as well as the most recent available common share valuation completed in may performed contemporaneously as of december  pursuant to which the fair value of our common shares was determined to be per share 
in the december  contemporaneous valuation  the discounted cash flow  or dcf  method  which is an accepted method within the income approach  was used to determine the fair market value of our equity 
once the fair market value of our equity was determined  it was allocated among our preferred and common shares outstanding using the option pricing method 
these methods are outlined in the aicpa practice aid and are discussed in further detail below 
to reach enterprise value as of december   a valuation using dcf methodology at the valuation date was performed 
under the dcf method  the fair value of the business is estimated based on the stream of benefits investors expect to receive  the timing of such benefits and the risk borne by investors 
once the enterprise value pursuant to the dcf analyses was determined  the enterprise value was allocated among our various classes of shares outstanding based on the characteristics of each such class and its claim on our assets 
our equity outstanding as of the valuation date included preferred shares  common shares and the class c purchase option 
stock characteristics that were factored into the analyses included liquidation preferences  participation features  convertibility features and value sharing between classes of shares 
since the proceeds of any liquidation event were to be divided among the holders of our preferred shares prior to any distribution to the holders of our common shares  it was determined that the common shares have the nature of a call option  with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the preferred shares are liquidated 
accordingly  the option pricing method was used to estimate the value of our common shares 
under the option pricing method  taken into account were the relative seniority  rights  liquidation preferences and conversion ratios of the convertible preferred shares  common shares and the class c purchase option as of the valuation date under the following two future shareholder exit or liquidity event scenarios a sale of our company  referred to as the sale scenario  and an ipo if we were not sold  referred to as the ipo scenario 

table of contents restricted securities can generally be purchased at prices substantially below those of identical but freely marketable securities due to the very real risk of market decline inherent in holding restricted securities 
as such the valuation relied on the finnerty model  which relates discount for lack of marketability to the length of the holding period for unregistered equity in a publicly traded corporation s stock  and the volatility of the underlying publicly traded equity 
using assumptions previously determined for the application of the option pricing model at the valuation date  the finnerty model indicated a discount for lack of marketability of approximately for the common shares 
as such  a discount for lack of marketability of was applied 
the discount for lack of marketability used in the december  valuation was lower than the discount for lack of marketability used in the may  valuation because the december  valuation assumed that a liquidity event would occur in a shorter period from the date of the valuation than did the may  valuation 
the fair market value of our common shares was estimated using the option pricing method utilizing the binomial model described above  with the following assumptions for each scenario sale scenario a risk free interest rate of  a dividend yield of  volatility of the expected market value of our total invested equity of approximately  and an expected term of one year  and ipo scenario a risk free interest rate of  a dividend yield of  volatility of the expected market value of our total invested equity of approximately and an expected term of years 
based on the foregoing  it was determined by the contemporaneous valuation that the fair value of our common shares in december was per share 
the board of directors then determined that there were events and circumstances that occurred between december  and july that indicated the fair value of our common shares should remain at the as had been determined by the board in february the additional specific facts and circumstances considered by our board of directors for its july valuation included our having received million from the closing of the second tranche of our class c redeemable preferred share financing in april preparation for enrollment in our solithromycin phase oral trial that commenced in july  and our having received favorable taksta phase clinical trial data in july based on all of these factors  the board determined that the fair value of our common shares at july  was per share 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we reassessed the fair value of our common shares for financial reporting purposes at july  and determined that no adjustment was necessary 
option grants on december  our board of directors granted options on december   with each option having an exercise price of per share 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements included in this report  after giving consideration to the estimated values that could be obtained in an ipo in the first quarter of and based on market and other conditions  we determined in september  that the grant date fair value of the options granted on december  required adjustment 
accordingly  we reassessed the fair value of our common shares at december  for financial reporting purposes 
in light of current market factors in the third quarter of  we used a pwerm approach to retrospectively reassess the value of our common shares as of december  in reassessing the fair value of our common shares  the board of directors considered the factors in their previous assessment of the december  fair value assessment  including in september  we commenced enrollment of patients in our solithromycin phase oral trial  in september  we commenced enrollment of healthy volunteers in our phase iv trial of solithromycin  in october  we had a successful end of phase meeting with the fda on taksta for absssi  and in december  we began significant discussions with potential partners for taksta for absssi 
in august  we decided to pursue an initial public offering of our common shares and held an organizational meeting with underwriters 
in light of this fact  management determined that it was prudent to reassess its previous determination of fair market value of common stock 
accordingly  a retrospective valuation was performed as of december  using a discounted cash flow  or dcf  method  which is an accepted method within the income approach  to determine the fair market value of our equity 
to arrive at an average enterprise value  a dcf was prepared utilizing various scenarios  including partnership funding for one or both solithromycin and taksta  an acquisition of one or both solithromycin and taksta  an acquisition of the entire company  partial partnership of one product candidate and no additional efforts on the other product candidate  and or a liquidation of the company 
in each of these scenarios  we prepared a discounted cash flow assessment  which included product revenue as early as and income from operations beginning in once the fair market value for our equity was determined  it was allocated among our preferred and common shares using the probability weighted return method or pwerm 
under the pwerm approach  share value is derived from the probability weighted present value of expected future investment returns  considering each of the possible outcomes available 
table of contents to us  as well as the economic and control rights of each share class 
the fair value of our common shares was estimated using a probability weighted analysis of the present value of the returns afforded to common shareholders under eight future shareholder exit or liquidity event scenarios  including an ipo  a sale to a larger private or public company  and a liquidation of our company  each with different timelines and valuations 
we discounted the probability weighted cash flows from each liquidation date to the valuation date using our weighted average cost of capital 
in the retrospective valuation  the weightings previously assigned to an ipo exit scenario were updated to assign additional weighting to these outcomes 
in addition  the timing of the exit scenarios was also updated in order to be consistent with the assumed ipo timeline established by management with the underwriters in august after applying a discount for lack of marketability of  the retrospective valuation indicated a fair market value of per share 
restricted securities can generally be purchased at prices substantially below those of identical but freely marketable securities due to the very real risk of market decline inherent in holding restricted securities 
as such the valuation relied on the finnerty model  which relates discount for lack of marketability to the length of the holding period for unregistered equity in a publicly traded corporation s stock  and the volatility of the underlying publicly traded equity 
using assumptions previously determined for the application of the option pricing model at the valuation date  the finnerty model indicated a discount for lack of marketability of approximately for the common shares 
as such  a discount for lack of marketability of was applied 
the increase in the fair market value from per common share at july  to per common share at december   was primarily driven by the timing of the exit scenarios and the weightings assigned to the liquidity events 
the timing of the exit scenarios was updated to reflect our discussions with underwriters in august of surrounding our ipo 
in the reassessment of our fair market value of common stock as of december   we assigned probability to the ipo scenarios  probability to the merger and acquisition scenarios  and to the liquidation scenario 
based on these factors  our board of directors determined that the retrospectively reassessed fair value of our common shares for financial reporting purposes at december  was per share 
the compensation charges reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this report reflect the reassessments of fair value that we conducted with respect to the december  option grants in the nine month period ended september  no adjustment was recorded for the year ended december   as such amounts were immaterial 
option grants on march  our board of directors granted options on march   with each option having an exercise price of per share 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements included in this report  after giving consideration to the estimated values that could be obtained in an ipo in the first quarter of and based on market and other conditions  we determined in september  that the grant date fair value of the options granted on march  required adjustment 
accordingly  we reassessed the fair value of our common shares at march  for financial reporting purposes 
in light of current market factors in the third quarter of  we used a pwerm approach to retrospectively reassess the value of our common shares as of march  in reassessing the fair value of our common shares  the board of directors considered the factors in their previous assessment of the march  fair value assessment  including in march  the data safety monitoring board concluded that our phase oral trial of solithromycin would need no further meetings with that body  based upon the safety and efficacy data it had reviewed to date  and we were in active discussions with multiple potential partners to potentially license multiple territories and channels for taksta 
in august  we decided to pursue an initial public offering of our common shares and held an organizational meeting with underwriters 
in light of this fact  management determined that it was prudent to reassess its previous determination of fair market value of our common shares 
accordingly  a retrospective valuation was performed as of march  using a dcf method  which is an accepted method within the income approach  to determine the fair market value of our equity 
to arrive at an average enterprise value  a dcf was prepared utilizing various scenarios  including partnership funding for one or both solithromycin and taksta  an acquisition of one or both solithromycin and taksta  an acquisition of the entire company  partial partnership of one product candidate and no additional efforts on the other product candidate  and or a liquidation of the company 
in each of these scenarios  we prepared a discounted cash flow assessment  which included product revenue as early as and income from operations beginning in once the fair market value for our equity was determined  it was allocated among our preferred and common shares using the probability weighted return method or pwerm 
under the pwerm approach  share value is derived from the probability weighted present value of expected future investment returns  considering each of the possible outcomes available to us  as well as the economic and control rights of each share class 
the fair value of our common shares was estimated using a probability weighted analysis of the present value of the returns afforded to common shareholders under eight future shareholder exit or liquidity event scenarios  including an ipo  a sale to a larger private or public company  and a liquidation of our company  each with different timelines and valuations 
we discounted the probability weighted cash flows from each liquidation date to the valuation date using our weighted average cost of capital 
in the retrospective valuation  the weightings previously assigned to an ipo exit scenario were updated to assign additional weighting to these outcomes 
in addition  the timing of the exit scenarios was also updated in order to be consistent with the assumed ipo timeline established by management with the underwriters in august 
table of contents after applying a discount for lack of marketability of  the retrospective valuation indicated a fair market value of per share 
restricted securities can generally be purchased at prices substantially below those of identical but freely marketable securities due to the very real risk of market decline inherent in holding restricted securities 
as such the valuation relied on the finnerty model  which relates discount for lack of marketability to the length of the holding period for unregistered equity in a publicly traded corporation s stock  and the volatility of the underlying publicly traded equity 
using assumptions previously determined for the application of the option pricing model at the valuation date  the finnerty model indicated a discount for lack of marketability of approximately for the common shares 
as such  a discount for lack of marketability of was applied 
the increase in the fair market value from per common share at december  to per common share at march   was primarily driven by the timing of the exit scenarios and the weightings assigned to the liquidity events 
the timing of the exit scenarios was updated to reflect our discussions with underwriters in august of surrounding our ipo 
we assigned probability to the ipo scenarios  probability to the merger and acquisition scenarios  and to the liquidation scenario 
these scenarios were more heavily weighted towards an ipo scenario on or before march  which indicated a higher enterprise valuation than the other scenarios 
in addition  as previously described  we discounted the probability weighted cash flows from each liquidation date to the valuation date using our weighted average cost of capital 
as the remaining time between the valuation date and the most probable scenario  or ipo scenario  of march  decreased  the impact of the discount applied also decreased 
these factors led to increase in value associated with our equity 
based on these factors  the board determined that the retrospectively reassessed fair value of our common shares for financial reporting purposes at march  was per share 
the compensation charges reflected in our consolidated financial statements included in this report reflect the reassessments of fair value that we conducted with respect to the march  option grants in the nine months ended september  there are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of these valuations 
these judgments and estimates include assumptions regarding our future performance  the time to completing an ipo  a strategic merger or sale  or other liquidity event  and the timing and probability of continuing to successfully progress our various product candidates toward commercialization  as well as determinations of the appropriate valuation methods 
if different assumptions had been applied in the valuations  our share based compensation expense  net loss and net loss per share could have been significantly different 
while the assumptions used to calculate and account for share based compensation awards represents management s best estimates  these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if revisions are made to the underlying assumptions and estimates  our share based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period 
despite the fact that  prior to becoming a public company  there were no additional stock option grants since march   we performed a contemporaneous valuation of the fair market value of our common stock at august   september  and again at december   which indicated a fair market value of per common share  per common share and at each valuation date  respectively 
in the august   september  and the december  contemporaneous valuations  the discounted cash flow  or dcf  method was consistently applied to determine the fair market value of our equity or enterprise value 
once the fair market value for the equity was determined  it was allocated among our preferred and common shares using the probability weighted return method  or pwerm 
the fair value of our common shares was estimated using a probability weighted analysis of the present value of the returns afforded to common shareholders under eight future exit or liquidity event scenarios  including an initial public offering  or ipo  a sale to a larger private or public company  and a liquidation of the company  each with different timelines and valuations 
we discounted the probability weighted cash flows from each liquidation date to the valuation date using its weighted average cost of capital 
in the december  contemporaneous valuation  we assigned additional weighting to the ipo exit scenarios  which was based primarily on the consideration of our successes in various drug development programs  increased discussions with potential partners for taksta and the filing of the registration statement on form s in october in addition  the other qualitative factors considered in the august   september  and december  contemporaneous valuations  included from a qualitative perspective  during the fourth quarter of  we decided to immediately pursue the development of taksta as a treatment for prosthetic joint infections  which decreased our expected development costs and increased our potential product revenue in future periods 
these factors led to an increase in the fair value of our common stock in the fourth quarter of  in june  we completed enrollment in the phase trial of oral solithromycin  in july  top line data indicated efficacy and safety for the phase trial of oral solithromycin  in august  the phase data from the oral trial of solithromycin indicated comparable efficacy and safety to the comparable product in the trial  
table of contents in august  subsequent to the data publication  we hired a consultant in the japanese market to seek partner candidates for solithromycin  in august and september  increased interest in partnerships for taksta was identified and successful meetings held with potential partners  and in august and september  interest in solithromycin significantly increased within our industry given the positive phase data 
in the august  and the september  contemporaneous valuations  we applied a discount for lack of marketability of 
the august  and the september  valuation relied on the finnerty model  which relates discount for lack of marketability to the length of the holding period for unregistered equity in a publicly traded corporation s stock  and the volatility of the underlying publicly traded equity 
using assumptions previously determined for the application of the option pricing model at the valuation date  the finnerty model indicated a discount for lack of marketability of approximately for the common shares 
as such  a discount for lack of marketability of was applied in august and september in the december  contemporaneous valuation  we applied a discount for lack of marketability of 
in the december  valuation  we utilized the finnerty model as a base in determining our discount for lack of marketability 
however  due to the increase in certainty surrounding the liquidity events  including the potential ipo  we selected a discount for lack of marketability below that indicated by the finnerty model 
therefore  a discount for lack of marketability of was applied 
the increases in the fair market value from per common share at march  to per common share at august  to per common share at september  and to per common share at december   were primarily driven by two items 
first  the weightings of the exit scenarios was updated to reflect our discussions with underwriters surrounding our planned ipo  which indicated an ipo scenario on or before march the weightings associated with the exit scenarios were as follows as of march   august   september  and december   respectively exit scenario march  august  september  december  ipo merger or acquisition liquidation the change in the scenario weightings over these time periods increased the value per common share  as estimated exit value associated with the ipo scenarios was greater than the liquidation scenario 
second  as previously described  we discounted the probability weighted cash flows from each liquidation date to the valuation date using our weighted average cost of capital 
as the remaining time between the valuation date and the most probable scenario  or ipo scenarios  of march  decreased in each of the respective valuations  the impact of the discount applied also decreased 
these quantitative elements  coupled with the qualitative factors described above  led to increase in value associated with our equity 
as noted above  our board of directors estimated the fair value of our common stock during these periods based on contemporaneous valuations performed 
we believe that the composition of our board of directors resulted in a fair and reasonable view of the stock value and  together with the valuations performed  resulted in a fair valuation of our common stock

table of contents funding requirements to date  we have not generated any product revenue from our development stage product candidates or from any other source 
we do not know when  or if  we will generate any product revenue 
we do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval of  and commercialize solithromycin and or taksta or any of our other product candidates 
at the same time  we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities  particularly as we continue the research  development and clinical trials of  and seek regulatory approval for  solithromycin and taksta and our other product candidates 
in addition  subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution 
we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations 
we expect that our existing cash and equivalents  including interest thereon  will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into this projection does not include funds to initiate the solithromycin phase iv to oral clinical trial 
we will need to obtain additional financing for the continued development of solithromycin  taksta and our other product candidates and prior to the commercialization of any of these product candidates 
we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of our product candidates 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress  costs and results of our ongoing oral solithromycin phase trial  the results of our planned end of phase meeting with the fda for the planned phase iv to oral trial for solithromycin  our ongoing taksta phase trial and any future trials for solithromycin and taksta  the scope  progress costs  and results of pre clinical development  laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the costs of commercialization activities  including product sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution  for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval  our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  revenue if any  received from sales of our product candidates  if approved by the fda  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  and our ability to obtain government or other third party funding 
until we can generate substantial product revenue  we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings  debt financings  government or other third party funding  marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations  strategic alliances and licensing arrangements 
we do not have any committed external source of funds 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders ownership interests will be diluted  and the terms of any securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights as a stockholder 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends  such as currently imposed under the loan from hercules 
if we raise additional funds through government or other third party funding  marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations  strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties  we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies  future revenue streams  research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
we plan to seek partners or other sources of third party funding  including government grants  for the continued development of solithromycin and taksta and our other product candidates 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  whether on favorable terms or not  we may be required to delay  limit  reduce or terminate our development of our product candidates  or our commercialization efforts  or to grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves

under the terms of the agreement with tsri  we paid a one time only  non refundable license issue fee in the amount of  our rights under the agreement are subject to certain customary rights of the us government that arise or result from tsri s receipt of research support from the us government 
we are also obligated to pay annual maintenance fees to tsri in the amount of i  each year for the first three years beginning on the first anniversary of the agreement  and ii  each year thereafter beginning on the fourth anniversary of the agreement 
each calendar year s annual maintenance fees will be credited against sales royalties due under the agreement for such calendar year 
under the terms of the agreement  we must pay tsri low single digit percentage royalties on the net sales of the products covered by the tsri patents for the life of the tsri patents  a low single digit percentage of non royalty sublicensing revenue received with respect to countries in the nonexclusive territory and a mid single digit percentage of sublicensing revenue received with respect to countries in the exclusive territory  with the sublicensing revenue royalty in the exclusive territory and the sales royalties subject to certain reductions under certain circumstances 
tsri is eligible to receive milestone payments of up to million with respect to regulatory approval in the exclusive territory and first commercial sale  in each of the exclusive territory and nonexclusive territory  of the first licensed product to achieve those milestones that is based upon each macrolide covered by the licensed patents 
each milestone is payable once per each macrolide 
each milestone payment made to tsri with respect to a particular milestone will be creditable against any payment due to tsri with respect to any sublicense revenues received in connection with the achievement of such milestone 
any payments made to tsri under the tsri license for territories subject to the optimer agreement can be deducted pursuant to the terms of the license agreement we have with optimer pharmaceuticals  from any sales based royalty payments due under the optimer agreement up to a certain percentage reduction of the royalties due to optimer 
under the terms of the tsri agreement  we are also required to pay additional fees on royalties  sublicensing and milestone payments if we  an affiliate  or a sub licensee challenges the validity or enforceability of any of the patents licensed under the agreement 
such increased payments would be required until all patent claims subject to challenge are invalidated in the particular country where such challenge was mounted 
the term of the tsri license agreement and the period during which we must pay royalties to tsri in a particular country for a particular product will end  on a country by country and product by product basis  at such time as no patent rights licensed from tsri cover a particular product in the particular country 
we have included in the table above the annual payments due tsri  but have not included any other payments because we cannot estimate if  when or in what amounts such payments will become due under the agreement 
in november  we entered into a new operating lease agreement for our current office space in chapel hill  north carolina 
the new lease term is months with an expiration date of november  aggregate lease payments over the term will be  in december  we entered into a  loan and security agreement with hercules and borrowed  upon closing

table of contents in march  we entered into a collaborative research and development and license agreement with optimer 
under the terms of the optimer agreement  we acquired exclusive rights to further develop and commercialize certain optimer technology worldwide  excluding asean countries 
as partial consideration for this license  during and  we issued to optimer an aggregate of  common shares with a total value of million 
we also have an obligation to make additional payments upon achievement of specified development  regulatory and commercialization milestones 
the aggregate amount of such milestone payments we may need to pay is based in part on the number of products developed under the agreement 
the aggregate amount of such payments would be million if four products are developed and gain fda approval 
additional limited milestone payments would be due if we develop more than four products 
in july  we made a million milestone payment to optimer after our successful completion of the phase trial for oral solithromycin and in july we made a million milestone payment upon completion of our discussions with the fda for the protocol for our proposed pivotal phase trial for oral solithromycin 
optimer can elect to receive certain milestone payments in cash or in shares of our common stock having an equivalent fair market value 
we are also obligated to make tiered  mid single digit royalty payments to optimer based on annual net sales of licensed products outside the asean countries  which royalties are subject to reduction in the event additional licenses are obtained from third parties in order to practice our rights under the agreement and or we are required to grant a compulsory license to a third party 
we have not included these payments in the table above because we cannot estimate if  when or in what amounts such payments will become due under this agreement 
we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations for clinical trials and clinical supply manufacturing and with vendors for pre clinical research studies  research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes 
these contracts generally provide for termination on notice and therefore we believe that our non cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material 
net operating losses as of december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net economic loss tax carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
the company also had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million which begin to expire in and federal charitable contribution carryforwards of approximately  which begin to expire in the tax reform act of contains provisions which limit the ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards in the case of certain events including significant changes in ownership interests 
if the company s net operating loss carryforwards are limited  and the company has taxable income which exceeds the permissible yearly net operating loss carryforward  the company would incur a federal income tax liability even though net operating loss carryforwards would be available in future years 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have during the periods presented  and we do not currently have  any off balance sheet arrangements as defined under sec rules
