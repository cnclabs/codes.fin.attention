item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
executive overview in the company accomplished two primary goals an aggressive reduction of its adversely classified assets and the completion of a million convertible preferred equity raise 
these two achievements are transformative for the company 
our strengthened balance sheet  our increased regulatory capital and the significant reduction of the expense weight of adversely classified assets will allow the company to pursue its vision of being a high performing community bank 
asset quality 
in mid the company formulated an asset disposition plan to resolve the lingering impact of the recession on its asset quality 
our operating results reflect the impact of the implementation of this plan 
the company had a net loss of million for the year 
we anticipated this result 
under the plan  the company projected that it would dispose of million in classified assets during we decided these dispositions would be handled internally  not through a broker  so that the company could eliminate broker fees  execute efficient sales and target the assets for liquidation that had the greatest imbedded losses 
we also decided that dispositions would be made through direct negotiations with customers  direct sales of notes  auctions and sales of small pools of homogeneous assets 
we began to execute on the plan in the third quarter and provisioned and expensed more than million of credit related costs in that period 
we also wrote down our deferred tax asset by million in the third quarter 
by year end  the company had reduced total classified assets by million  or million more than the projected total under the plan 
total classified assets were million at december   one third the level of year end balance of million 
we believe the asset disposition plan was highly successful 
the negative impact of adversely classified assets on the company s earnings was markedly reduced 
as a result  our fourth quarter net income climbed to a record level of million  an increase of over the prior year s fourth quarter 
we believe that our future earnings will also be favorably impacted by the increased quality of our assets 
equity raise 
following the merger of fnb financial services corporation into the company  our board and management established a disciplined business model built on an operating vision of quality  profitability and growth 
additionally  our president and chief executive officer  pressley a 
ridgill  brought together a management team united behind a simple  but powerful  principle financial success begins with integrity 
during this time  however  the effects of the economic recession were increasing and direct pursuit of our vision was not possible 
we had to pause and deal with the challenges before us 
we elected not to defer credit costs 
instead  we aggressively charged off and wrote down credits 
from late through the completion of the asset disposition plan in the fourth quarter of  the company charged off over million of loans and other real estate owned  or of the company s peak level of loan balances in september of in addition  the company made the difficult but necessary decisions to close or sell multiple branches and reduce the number of its full time employees by one third 
the results of our commitment to directly confront our challenges were mounting losses  declining capital  a reduction in size and decreasing valuation of our shares in the market 
by late  the company s well capitalized status was threatened 
we accepted million of capital through the troubled asset relief program tarp 
our acceptance of tarp capital has presented challenges 
it currently requires the payment of a dividend at an annual rate of 
moreover  the market value of the company s shares likely has been depressed in part because of investors concerns over our ability to repay the tarp capital and the cost of the necessary replacement capital 
as with our asset quality difficulties  we decided to aggressively resolve our tarp capital challenges 
on november   the company agreed to issue approximately million of convertible preferred stock to a number of selected investors at a price of per common share equivalent 
the market price of the company s common stock on the last trading day before november  was 
the closing of this private placement occurred on november  at a special shareholders meeting on february   the shareholders of the company overwhelmingly approved resolutions providing for the conversion of the convertible preferred stock into million shares of voting class a common stock and million shares of nonvoting class b common stock 
the company believes that the combination of the significant enhancement of its asset quality and its ability to redeem its tarp capital  without impacting materially its well capitalized status  as a result of its equity raise  have transformed the opportunities available to it 
although the economy remains difficult and presently unknown challenges may well arise  the company believes that it has the financial strength and management depth needed to aggressively pursue its vision of quality  profitability and growth 
highlights 
the company took significant actions in in pursuit of its operating vision 
quality nonperforming assets declined million as a percentage of assets  nonperforming assets declined from to total adversely classified assets declined from million to million other real estate owned declined to million profitability the net interest margin averaged core deposit costs declined to at year end core deposits represented of total deposits at year end total noninterest expense declined million  or  excluding million of one time expense the closing of two branch locations was decided as part of our redeployment of resources in more vibrant markets branch locations were reduced to down from in annual operating expenses have declined by million since growth loan balances increased  net of classified loans our footprint was expanded into the raleigh and charlotte markets through loan production offices twelve senior level experienced community bankers were employed  including new market executives in the piedmont triad and charlotte markets pursuing our community banking strategy the company will remain focused on opportunities to achieve our vision of quality  profitability and growth 
we will continue to manage our progress in achieving these goals through basic  measurable operating objectives that communicate throughout the organization the steps needed to enhance the company s financial results 
many of these steps have been taken  others are underway and still others will be taken in coming periods 
sustained asset quality 
we believe we have resolved our asset quality issues and achieved the asset base necessary to achieve sustained profitability 
the balance of nonperforming assets at december  totaled million  or of total assets  down from million  or of total assets  at december  our nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans  loans that have been impaired and on which management no longer believes all principal and interest will be collected  loans that have been restructured to aid the financial distress of a borrower  and other real estate owned which is physical real estate that the company has taken in settlement of troubled debt 
likewise  total classified loans declined  or million  for the year to million 
this total is down  or million  from the peak level at september  at december   other real estate owned totaled million  down from million at december  at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  or of loans held for investment  and of nonperforming loans 
management believes that substantially all losses in the company s impaired and nonperforming loans have been recognized and charged off through the allowance for credit losses 
profitability 
the company s ability to achieve sustained profitability depends not only on the maintenance of a high level of asset quality  but on careful management of interest income  interest expense and other expense 
management has identified and implemented a number of steps to increase net interest and fee income  preserve an acceptable net interest margin and control our controllable expenses 
expanded our presence into key north carolina markets and redeployed resources previously dedicated to less vibrant areas 
the company has opened loan production offices in raleigh and charlotte  nc the two largest and fastest growth banking markets in north carolina 
the company also established loan production offices in smaller markets in which particular growth opportunities were identified 
our goal is to pursue opportunities to increase our portfolio of creditworthy loans with attractive interest rates 
additionally  the company sold its harrisonburg  virginia operations and closed branches not meeting its profitability requirements 
reduced the company s dependence on high cost time deposits in favor of lower cost core accounts  including dda  now checking  money market and savings accounts 
acquired a mortgage brokerage operation fee revenues increased over the prior year 
established a loan pricing committee to better evaluate risk based and relationship pricing to include deposit and other relationships 
management has also focused on maintaining consistency on loan pricing relative to credit characteristics of loans 
redirected portfolio investments to corporate debt and commercial mortgage backed securities 
expanded our trust and wealth management services assets under management increased in and have increased since 
maintained a disciplined and accountable budget process that includes monitoring loan  investment and deposit yields  carefully reviewing variances every month  and reviewing controllable expenses every month 
expense management is critical to the achievement of our profitability goals 
management has implemented a disciplined cost management culture where that which is within our control is controlled 
a key element to creating this culture is our line item accountable budget process 
the foundation of our budgeting process is the cast philosophy conservative in forecasts and expectations accountable on an account by account basis specific to each individual in the organization so goals and budgets are understood timely so that continued monitoring and adjustments can be made several major cost reduction initiatives focused on eliminating excess costs and non core or unprofitable activities are continuing 
these initiatives include an ongoing franchise validation plan  which carefully reviews each of our branch locations and targets the elimination of waste  inefficiency and duplication throughout our franchise 
each branch is evaluated for its pre tax contribution  the age and state of the branch facility  the ease of closure  market demographics and the branch s overall fit within our strategic vision 
execution of the franchise validation plan and other expense reduction initiatives have resulted in a net reduction of bank locations and full time equivalent employees since the third quarter of the reduction in the number of branch locations and other expense reductions resulted in an improvement of our core efficiency from a high of in to in growth 
as a community bank  we believe our opportunities to achieve exceptional returns for our shareholders depend upon consistent delivery of superior customer service to small to medium sized business and retail clients in a manner that the large national and super regional banks are unable or unwilling to emulate 
the piedmont triad has approximately billion of deposits 
the market is dominated by large national and regional banks  with of the market s deposits residing in banks with more than billion of assets 
we believe that we have an opportunity to materially increase our deposit share of this market 
while deposit growth is available in our primary market of the piedmont triad  quality loan opportunities in that market and elsewhere in our footprint have been insufficient in recent quarters to offset loan portfolio pay downs 
although we will continue to aggressively compete in the piedmont triad and in our coastal market  the company has determined that to achieve its growth goals it must seek out additional opportunities 
consequently  we have opened loan production offices in raleigh  nc and in charlotte  nc  two of the fastest growing metropolitan statistical areas msas in our country 
these offices will be converted to branch offices in the company now has a lending presence in each of the four largest msas in nc charlotte  raleigh  the piedmont triad and wilmington 
we believe this expansion of our footprint will enhance our ability to significantly grow our deposit base and loan portfolio 
although we intend to grow our deposit base and loan portfolio in our traditional and new markets  we will also consider other opportunities to expand our operations in these markets or in markets complementary to our existing franchise 
we intend  however  to employ a disciplined approach  consistent with our management philosophy  in evaluating any such opportunities 
the future 
we cannot predict with assurance the performance of the company in the coming years 
banks operate in an environment where factors beyond their control impact their performance 
recessions  stricter government regulations  interest rates  real property values  consumer spending  investment yields  regulatory capital requirements  and unemployment rates to name a few can and do adversely impact the profitability of financial institutions 
we do believe  however  that our aggressive resolution of our asset quality issues  the capital strength provided by our equity raise  our commitment to careful management of the drivers of our income and our expenses  and our focus on thoughtful growth  position our company to move beyond the challenges of the past and seize upon opportunities available to us now and in the future 
financial condition at december  and the company s consolidated assets of billion at year end reflect a decrease of from year end the decrease was primarily a result of a decline in the company s loan portfolio 
total average assets decreased from billion in  to billion in  while average earning assets decreased  from billion in  to billion in the decreases in total average assets and average earning assets were also primarily the result of a decrease in loans outstanding 
loans excluding loans held for sale decreased million during  or  compared to a decrease of in the decline in loans was due primarily to our asset disposition plan 
in our quarterly report on form q for the second quarter of  we disclosed that a plan was being developed to accelerate the workout and disposition of a substantial portion of remaining problem assets 
during the third quarter  management initiated the asset disposition plan 
using march  problem asset levels  management established the following goals nonperforming loans reduce by million to million performing classified loans reduce by million to million real estate acquired in settlement of loans oreo reduce by million to million total classified assets reduce by million to million classified assets reduce to of tier capital plus allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets reduce to or less of total assets by december   the asset disposition plan was completed 
as of that date  total problem assets were reduced by approximately million from the march  levels as follows nonperforming loans reduced by million to million performing classified loans reduced by million to million oreo reduced by million to million total classified assets reduced by million to million classified assets reduced to of tier capital plus allowance for credit losses nonperforming assets reduced to of total assets the results achieved through the asset disposition plan are reflected in the amounts reported for december  and for the periods then ended and are the principal reasons for changes from prior period amounts 
loans secured by real estate totaled billion at year end and represented of total loans excluding loans held for sale  compared with at year end within this category  residential real estate loans decreased to million  and construction loans decreased to million

total deposits decreased million to billion at december   a decrease from a total of billion one year earlier 
the decline in deposits was due primarily to lower time deposit balances  which fell million for the year 
retail time deposits declined million for the year as the company has chosen not to compete for high priced time deposits 
noninterest bearing deposits increased million for the year to million due in part to changes in the rate and fee structures the company applied to certain product offerings in the fourth quarter of in order to attract additional deposits  when necessary the bank uses several different sources such as membership in an electronic deposit gathering network that allows it to post interest rates and attract deposits from across the us bulletin board deposits  brokered certificates of deposit secured through broker dealer partnerships and deposits obtained through the promontory interfinancial network  also known as cdars 
cdars increased million  from million at year end to million at year end  while brokered deposits decreased million  from million at year end to million at year end the bank also has a credit facility available with the fhlb of atlanta 
the bank utilized a portion of the million credit line with the fhlb of atlanta to fund earning assets 
fhlb borrowings totaled million at year end  and based on collateral pledged  was available to be borrowed 
in addition to the credit line at the fhlb  the bank has borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank totaling million  and has federal funds lines of million  of which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  management believes these credit lines are a cost effective and prudent alternative to deposit balances  since particular amounts  terms and structures may be selected to meet changing needs

total average assets decreased from billion in  to billion in  while average earning assets decreased  from billion in  to billion in the decreases in total average assets and average earning assets were also primarily the result of a decrease in loans outstanding 
loans excluding loans held for sale decreased million during  or  compared to a decrease of in the decrease in loans in is due primarily to principal repayment on existing loans and loan chargeoffs and foreclosures  coupled with soft loan demand from qualified borrowers 
the decrease in loans in is due primarily to the reclassification of million of loans from loans held for investment to loans held for sale in connection with the sale of the bank s virginia operation in may loans secured by real estate totaled billion in and represented of total loans excluding loans held for sale  compared with at year end within this category  residential real estate loans decreased to million and construction loans decreased to million

total deposits decreased million to billion at december   a decrease from a total of billion one year earlier 
this change was primarily the result of a million reduction in time deposits  as the interest rates offered by the bank were reduced substantially during the year

the bank s fastforward checking product  introduced in the third quarter of  totaled million at december  net interest income like most financial institutions  the primary component of the company s revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investments  and interest expense on customer deposits and borrowings

spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
spread and margin are influenced by the levels and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as by levels of noninterest bearing liabilities

real estate loans 
loans secured by real estate totaled billion  or of total loans excluding loans held for sale  at december  at year end  the bank had real estate loan relationships of various sizes ranging up to million and commitments up to million  secured by office buildings  retail establishments  residential development and construction  warehouses  motels  restaurants and other types of property 
loan terms are typically limited to five years  with payments through the date of maturity generally based on a year year for owner occupied single and multi family properties amortization schedule 
interest rates may be fixed or adjustable  based on market conditions  and the bank generally charges an origination fee 
management has attempted to reduce credit risk in the real estate portfolio by emphasizing loans on owner occupied office  multi family and retail buildings where the loan to value ratio  established by independent appraisals  does not exceed to  and net projected cash flow available for debt service amounts to at least to of the debt service requirement 
the bank also generally requires personal guarantees and personal financial statements from the principal owners in such cases 
real estate mortgage 
the bank originates fixed and adjustable rate mortgages as well as fha  va and usda government supported loans for resale into the secondary market 
the bank provides bank held mortgage products to accommodate qualified borrowers who may not meet all the standards for a conventional secondary market mortgage 
during  the bank originated million of loans in these various categories 
also included in real estate mortgage loans are home equity revolving lines of credit  with million outstanding as of december  the bank recorded net chargeoffs from mortgage loans of million during  compared to million in and million in real estate construction loans 
the bank s current lending strategy is to moderately increase exposure in this portfolio segment 
the bank expects that the majority of its new construction and development loans on commercial and residential projects will be in the range of  to million 
at december  and  the bank held million and million  respectively  of such loans 
to reduce credit risk associated with such loans  the bank emphasizes small commercial centers that are substantially pre leased  or residential projects that are substantially pre sold and built in strong  proven markets 
the leases on commercial projects must generally result in a loan to appraised value of to or less and a net cash flow to debt service of no less than to 
the bank typically requires a personal guarantee from the developer or builder 
loan terms are generally months  although the bank will make a mini permanent loan for purposes of construction and development of up to a five year term 
rates can be either fixed or variable  and the bank usually charges an origination fee 
the bank experienced net chargeoffs from real estate construction loans of million in  million in and million in commercial loans 
the bank makes loans for commercial purposes to various types of businesses 
at december   the bank held million of commercial loans  or of its total loan portfolio 
equipment loans are typically made on terms up to five years at fixed or variable rates  with the financed equipment pledged as collateral to the bank 
the bank attempts to reduce its credit risk on these loans by limiting the loan to value percentage to 
working capital loans are made on terms typically not exceeding one year 
these loans may be secured or unsecured  but the bank attempts to limit its credit risk by requiring the borrower to demonstrate its capacity to produce net cash flow available for debt service equal to to of its debt service requirements 
the bank experienced net chargeoffs from commercial loans of million in  million in  and million in consumer loans 
using a centralized underwriting process  the bank makes a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes  including i secured and unsecured installment and term loans originated directly by the bank  ii unsecured revolving lines of credit  and iii amortizing secured lot loans 
certain of the direct loans are secured by the borrowers residences 
at december   the bank held million of consumer loans 
during   and  the bank experienced net consumer loan chargeoffs of million  million  and million  respectively 
loan approval and review 
when the aggregate outstanding loans to a single borrower or related entities exceed an individual officer s lending authority  the loan request must be considered and approved by an officer with a higher lending limit 
all consumer purpose loan decisions are made through a centralized underwriting process 
commercial banking managers cbm can generally approve commercial relationships up to  if the lending request exceeds the cbm s lending limit  the loan must be submitted to and approved by a senior credit officer 
a senior credit officer has authority to approve commercial relationships up to  on a secured basis 
all loan relationships between  and  must be approved by the chief commercial credit officer ccco 
all loans between  and  must be approved by the chief credit officer cco 
loan relationships exceeding  up to  must be unanimously approved by a committee of the ccco  the cco  and the bank s ceo 
loan relationships over  must be approved by the credit management committee of the bank s board of directors 
the bank s loan review program is headed by the loan review manager  who reports directly to the credit management committee of the bank s board of directors 
the program includes the annual loan review coverage plan which is approved by the credit management committee and which stipulates a certain number of loan reviews to be completed by the loan review manager and employees under his or her guidance  and an additional number of loan reviews to be completed by independent loan review consulting firms 
the bank s credit review system supplements its loan rating system  pursuant to which the bank may place a loan on its criticized asset list or may classify a loan in one of various other classification categories 
in addition  all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing their portfolios and making adjustments to the risk ratings as needed 
the watch loan committee  which includes the cco  the ccco  the special assets manager and the special assets officers  reviews all commercial loans graded special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss on a monthly basis  and provides a summary to the credit management committee  also on a monthly basis 
in addition  a committee made up of the special assets manager  special assets officers  senior credit officers and senior lenders reviews all past due loans on a monthly basis and provides a summary to management 
the bank s loan portfolio is analyzed on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
its allowance for credit losses is also analyzed monthly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
a specified minimum percentage of loans in each adverse asset classification category  based on the probability of default and on the historical loss experience of the bank in each such category  as well as other environmental factors such as the unemployment level or other economic conditions affecting that type of loan  are used to determine the adequacy of the bank s allowance for credit losses monthly 
these loans are also individually reviewed by the bank s watch loan committee to determine whether a greater allowance allocation is justified due to the facts and circumstances of a particular adversely classified loan 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines 
the provisions of asc loans that are identified for evaluation or that are individually considered impaired are applied to individually significant loans 
finally  individual reserves may be recorded based on a review of loans on the watch list

see lending activities loan approval and review 
it is the responsibility of each commercial lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan they originate 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is the lending officer s responsibility to recommend appropriate changes in the borrower s risk grade 
currently  the grading process utilized by the bank is segmented by product type 
this methodology does not provide a direct correlation with groupings utilized in the other tables presenting loan information 
the following table summarizes  by internally assigned risk grade  the risk grade for loans for which the bank has assigned a risk grade

because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on its assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are generally viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the bank s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the bank s credit policies and procedures

the allocation is not necessarily indicative of future losses 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity have a lower risk profile than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  because the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
the bank has little or no exposure to subprime lending 
consumer loans  which are smaller in size and more geographically diverse across the bank s entire primary market areas  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the bank s lowest risk profile loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans because home equity loans are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decision making process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity and mortgage loan portfolio 
the consumer real estate appraisal process is also centralized relative to appraisal engagement  appraisal review  and appraiser quality assessment 
these processes are detailed in the underwriting guidelines  which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
the bank s loan review program is designed to evaluate the credit risk in its loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  the bank maintains an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific loans  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss as described below  and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
special mention these loans have potential weaknesses  which may  if not corrected or reversed  weaken the bank credit position at some future date 
the loans may not currently show problems due to the borrower s apparent ability to service the debt  but special circumstances surround the loans of which the bank and management should be aware 
this category may also include loans where repayment has not been satisfactory  where constant attention is required to maintain a set repayment schedule  or where terms of a loan agreement have been violated but the borrower still appears to have sufficient financial strength to avoid a lower rating 
it also includes new loans that significantly depart from established loan policy and loans to weak borrowers with a strong guarantor 
substandard these are loans whose full final collectability may not appear to be a matter for serious doubt  but which nevertheless have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and require close supervision by management  such as unprofitable and or undercapitalized businesses  inability to generate sufficient cash flow for debt reduction  deterioration of collateral and special problems arising from the particular condition of an industry 
it also includes workout loans on a liquidation basis when a loss is not expected 
some of these loans are considered impaired 
doubtful these loans have all the weakness inherent in loans graded substandard with the added provision that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and value  highly questionable 
in some instances  the extent of the potential loss is not currently determinable 
most of these loans are considered impaired 
the process of determining the allowance for credit losses is driven by the risk grade system and the loss experience on non risk graded homogeneous types of loans 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for credit losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
consideration is also given to a review of individual loans  historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral and economic conditions in the bank s market areas 
for loans determined to be impaired  the impairment is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral  less selling and other handling costs  for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize changes to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
loans are charged off when in the opinion of management  they are deemed to be uncollectible 
recognized losses are charged against the allowance  and subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
management believes the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio  however  assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires continuous evaluation and considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events which it believes to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that credit losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting future operating results of the bank 
the following table presents an analysis of the changes in the allowance for credit losses

all commercial loans within the portfolio are risk graded among nine risk grades based on management s evaluation of the overall credit quality of the loan  including the payment history  the financial position of the borrower  the underlying collateral value  an internal credit risk assessment and examination results 
as a result  the allowance is adjusted upon any migration of a loan to a higher or lower risk grade within the commercial loan portfolio 
the reserve percentages utilized have been determined by management to be appropriate based on historical loan loss levels and the risk for each corresponding risk grade 
mortgage  home equity  and credit lines 
reserves are calculated on mortgage  home equity  and credit lines based on historical loss experience 
the average rolling quarter net loss percentage is calculated for each of these loan categories  and is multiplied by the dollar balance of loans in each of these categories to determine the required reserve 
consumer loans 
the consumer loans are pooled together to determine the reserve requirement 
the average rolling quarter net loss percentage is calculated for this loan category  and is multiplied by the dollar balance of retail loans to determine a required reserve 
an additional reserve  equal to of all retail loans past due days or more  is added to the above 
specific impairment 
management evaluates significant loans graded substandard  doubtful and loss on an individual basis for impairment 
the specific allowance is calculated based upon a review of these loans and the estimated losses at the balance sheet date 
at december  and  the recorded investment in loans specifically identified and evaluated for impairment was approximately million and million  respectively and the specific allowance for credit losses associated with those loans was approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the amount of specifically impaired loans held by the bank and the associated allowance for credit losses resulted primarily from the bank s decision to take appropriate aggressive action with our problem credits through chargeoffs and foreclosure 
performing classified loans 
loans graded substandard  doubtful and loss which do not fit the criteria to be considered significant are not evaluated on an individual basis for impairment 
however  the bank closely monitors such loans as a result of their elevated risk profile 
as a result of the bank s discipline  the balance of these performing classified loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  the loans that make up this category trended as management had projected and reached a peak level in the third quarter of these loans  while exhibiting signs of weakness  continue to perform pursuant to stated terms and conditions and therefore do not have specifically identified expected losses 
approximately of the loans in this category are identified as commercial and industrial or income producing commercial real estate  which management assigns a lower probability of default and or loss given default 
the allowance for credit losses associated with such loans was million at december   which was based on a model that uses probability of default  and expected loss in the event of default  to determine inherent losses within a given group of loans 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses totaled million  compared to million in as of december   nonperforming assets totaled million  comprised of million in nonperforming loans and million in oreo 
those figures compare to million in nonperforming loans and million in oreo at the end of  totaling million in nonperforming assets 
net chargeoffs increased in to million  or of average loans outstanding  compared with million  or of average loans outstanding  in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  the company charged off million of a million loan composed of subordinated debt to a financial institution 
in the first quarter of  an additional writedown of million was recorded on this loan 
the bank forgave million of the loan and all unpaid interest and the remaining million was exchanged for preferred stock with a liquidation preference value of million in the institution 
the bank s recorded investment of million is carried in other assets on the company s balance sheet as of december  periodic impairment evaluations are performed and management believes this asset is currently not impaired 
the company does not have any other loans to financial institutions 
at december  and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of year end loans excluding loans held for sale was and  respectively 
the and results have been impacted by the continued weakness in the regional and national economies as well as the problem asset disposition plan

loans are placed on nonaccrual status when i management has concerns relating to the ability to collect the loan principal and interest and ii generally when such loans are days or more past due 
no assurance can be given  however  that economic conditions will not adversely affect borrowers and result in increased credit losses 
the bank s policy for impaired loan accounting subjects all loans to impairment recognition except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as credit card  residential mortgage and consumer loans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is considered to be the bank s interest rate risk which could potentially have the greatest impact on operating earnings 
the bank is not subject to other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity or equity price risk 
interest rate risk on our balance sheet arises from the maturity mismatch of interest earning assets versus interest bearing liabilities  as well as the potential for maturities to shorten or lengthen our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk management is a part of the bank s overall asset liability management process 
the primary oversight of asset liability management rests with the bank s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of the bank s ceo  chief financial officer cfo and other senior executives 
the committee meets approximately twice per quarter to review the asset liability management activities of the bank and monitor compliance with established policies 
activities of the asset and liability committee are reported to the audit and risk management committees of the company s and the bank s board of directors 
the bank uses several interest rate risk measurement tools provided by a national asset liability management consultant to help manage this risk 
the bank s asset liability policy provides guidance for acceptable levels of interest rate risk and potential remediations 
management provides the consultant with key assumptions  which are used as inputs into the measurement tools 
following is a summary of two different tools management uses on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
earnings simulation modeling 
net income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve and the general market pressures affecting current market interest rates at the time of simulation 
many interest rate indices do not move uniformly  creating certain disunities between them 
for example  the spread between a day  prime based asset and a day  fhlb advance may not be uniform over time 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income caused by the effect of changes in interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
simulation results are measured as a percentage change in net interest income compared to the static rate or base case scenario 
the model uses the bank s current balance sheet  but considers decreases in asset and liability volumes based on prepayment assumptions as well as rate changes 
rate changes are modeled gradually over a month period  referred to as a rate ramp 
the model projects only changes in interest income and expense and does not project changes in noninterest income  noninterest expense  provision for loan losses or the impact of changing tax rates 
at december   net interest income simulation showed a positive change from the base case in a basis point ramped rising rate environment and a negative change from the base case in a basis point ramped declining rate environment 
the projected changes in net interest income are within the board of directors guidelines in a basis point increasing or basis point decreasing interest rate environment 
however  management continually monitors signs of elevated risks and takes certain actions to limit these risks 
the following table summarizes the results of the bank s income simulation model as of december  change in net interest income year year change in market interest rates basis point ramped increase base case no change basis point ramped decrease net portfolio value analysis 
net portfolio value npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any actions management might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
the following is a summary of the results of the report compiled by the bank s outside consultant using data and assumptions management provided as of december  estimated change in net portfolio value amount in s percent change in market interest rates basis point increase  base case no change basis point decrease  the preceding table indicates that  at december   in the event of a basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates  npv would be expected to decrease by million  or of the base case scenario value of million 
in the event of a decrease in prevailing market rates of basis points  npv would be expected to decline by million  or of the base case scenario value 
the projected changes in npv are within the board of directors guidelines in a basis point increasing or basis point decreasing interest rate environment 
however  management continually monitors signs of elevated risks and takes certain actions to limit these risks 
a primary objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to ensure the stability and quality of the bank s primary earnings component  net interest income 
this process involves monitoring the bank s balance sheet in order to determine the potential impact that changes in the interest rate environment may have on net interest income 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rates that are subject to change within a specific time period  due to either maturity or to contractual agreements which allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates within a similar time period  thereby minimizing the risk to net interest income

this ratio indicates that a larger balance of liabilities  compared to assets  could potentially reprice during the upcoming month period 
included in rate sensitive liabilities are certain deposit accounts negotiable order of withdrawal now  money market investment mmi  and savings that are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing 
these balances are presented in the category that management believes best identifies their actual repricing patterns 
the overall risk to net interest income is also influenced by the bank s level of variable rate loans 
these are loans with a contractual interest rate tied to an interest rate index  such as the prime rate 
a portion of these loans may reprice on multiple occasions during a one year period due to changes in the underlying interest rate index
