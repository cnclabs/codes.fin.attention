chlorovinyls business overview our chlorovinyls segment produces a highly integrated chain of products  including chlor alkali and derivative products chlorine  caustic soda  vcm  vinyl resins  edc  chlorinated solvents  calcium hypochlorite  hcl and phosgene derivatives and compound products vinyl compounds and compound additives and plasticizers 
as discussed further below  certain highlights from our chlorovinyls segment results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  were as follows net sales totaled  million compared with net sales of  million for the year ended december  net sales increased approximately percent as a result of an increase in our overall sales prices of percent on flat sales volume compared to the year ended december  our vinyl compounds sales prices increased approximately percent from to  although our overall chlorovinyls sales volume remained unchanged 
our chlorovinyls segment and the chemical industry in general are cyclical in nature and are affected by domestic and worldwide economic conditions 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply and demand  can lead to significant changes in the overall profitability of our chlorovinyls segment 
the demand for our chlorovinyls products tends to reflect fluctuations in downstream markets that are affected by consumer spending for durable and non durable goods as well as construction 
global capacity also materially affects the prices of chlorovinyls products 
historically  in periods of high operating rates  prices rise and margins increase and  as a result  new capacity is announced 
since world scale size plants are generally the most cost competitive  new increases in capacity tend to be on a large scale and are often undertaken by existing industry participants 
usually  as new capacity is added  prices decline until increases in demand improve operating rates and the new capacity is absorbed or  in some instances  until less efficient producers withdraw capacity from the market 
as the additional supply is absorbed  operating rates rise  prices increase and the cycle repeats 
in addition  purchased raw materials and natural gas costs account for the majority of our cost of sales and can also have a material effect on our profitability and margins 
some of the primary raw materials used in our chlorovinyls products  including ethylene  are crude oil and natural gas derivatives and therefore follow the oil and gas industry price trends 
building products business overview our building products segment consists of two primary product groups i window and door profiles and mouldings products  which include extruded vinyl window and door profiles and interior and exterior mouldings products  and ii outdoor building products  which currently includes siding  pipe and pipe fittings and deck products

table of contents on a constant currency basis and adjusting for the closure of the fence product line and our acquisition of exterior portfolio  llc exterior portfolio  net sales for the year increased percent while volume was flat with for the year ended december   our building products segment geographical sales to the us and canada were percent and percent  respectively  which is consistent with the same period in the building products segment is impacted by changes in the north american home repair and remodeling sectors  as well as the new construction sector  which may be significantly affected by changes in economic and other conditions such as gross domestic product levels  employment levels  demographic trends  consumer confidence  increases in interest rates and availability of consumer financing for home repair and remodeling projects as well as availability of financing for new home purchases 
these factors can lower the demand for and pricing of our products  while we may not be able to reduce our costs by an equivalent amount 
aromatics business overview our aromatics segment is highly integrated and manufactures cumene products and phenol and acetone products co products made from cumene 
as discussed further below  certain highlights of our aromatics segment results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  were as follows net sales were  million for the year ended december   an increase of percent when compared to  million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   sales volume increased percent 
our overall aromatics sales volume increased as a result of increases in the sales volume of cumene of percent  partially offset by decreases in phenol and acetone sales volumes of approximately percent 
our cumene sales volume increase was due to increased contract sales as well as some opportunistic spot sales 
our overall average sales price decreased as a result of a percent reduction in the price of cumene  partially offset by a percent increase in the price of phenol and acetone 
the overall sales price decreases reflect lower costs for the feedstock propylene 
significant volatility in raw materials costs can decrease product margins as sales price increases sometimes lag raw materials cost increases 
product margins may also suffer from a sharp decline in raw materials costs due to the time lag between the purchase of raw materials and the sale of the finished goods manufactured using those raw materials

year ended december  compared with year ended december  consolidated results net sales 
for the year ended december   net sales totaled  million compared to  million for the year ended december  net sales increased percent due to an increase in our overall sales volume of percent  partially offset by a decrease in our overall sales price of percent 
our overall sales volume increase was primarily a result of increases in the sales volumes of our chlorovinyls and aromatics segments  offset by planned and unplanned outages at our plaquemine facilities during the overall sales price decrease was primarily attributable to lower unit sales prices in our chlorovinyls and aromatics segments driven by lower feedstocks costs 
gross margin 
total gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to percent for the year ended december  from percent for the year ended december  this increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to margin expansion in our chlorovinyls  aromatics and building products segments as a decline in our feedstocks costs more than offset lower sales prices 
the million gross margin increase was primarily due to i our overall margin expansion as a result of the decrease in feedstocks costs exceeding the decrease in sales price and ii an increase in our sales volume for our aromatics and chlorovinyls segments offset partially by increased maintenance costs for our chlorovinyls segment 
our primary feedstocks and natural gas costs in our chlorovinyls and aromatics segments normally track industry prices 
ihs reported industry prices decreased by percent for propylene  percent for ethylene  percent for chlorine and percent for natural gas from to  while benzene prices increased by percent over the comparative periods

provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  compared to a benefit from income taxes of million for the year ended december  the change in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from the increase in income for the year ended december  offset by the resolution of uncertain tax positions in  primarily in canada  that arose before the acquisition of royal group in october our effective income tax rates for the years ended december  and were positive percent and negative percent  respectively 
the difference in the effective tax rate as compared to the us statutory federal income tax rate in was primarily due to certain credits claimed against taxes and the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions  primarily in canada  that arose before the acquisition of royal group  offset by the increase in the valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax assets in canada

chlorovinyls segment net sales 
net sales totaled  million for the year ended december  compared with net sales of  million for the year ended december  net sales increased approximately percent as a result of an increase in our overall sales prices of percent on flat sales volume compared to the year ended december  our overall sales price increase was primarily due to the increase in the sales price of caustic soda and vinyl compounds offset by a decrease in the vinyl resin sales price due to lower feedstocks costs 
according to ihs  the caustic soda industry sales price increased percent from to our vinyl compounds sales prices increased approximately page of 
table of contents percent from to our overall chlorovinyls sales volume remained unchanged as an increase in vinyl resin export sales volume of percent was offset by planned and unplanned outages at our plaquemine  louisiana facilities during the year ended december   which  in turn  was partially offset by reduced operating rates last year that were due to an unplanned chlor alkali plant outage for maintenance and a resulting force majeure in our vinyl resin business  as well as  logistical issues due to the high water on the mississippi river system 
north american vinyl resin industry sales volume increased percent as a result of an increase in domestic sales volume of percent and export sales volume of percent  according to statistics from pips made publicly available in january operating income 
operating income increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to lower feedstock costs of million in as compared to  an increase in vinyl resins sales volume and the increase in the sales prices of caustic soda and vinyl compounds  partially offset by an increase in maintenance expense due to planned and unplanned outages at our plaquemine  louisiana facilities during the million gain from the sale of our air separation unit in plaquemine  louisiana also contributed to the increase in operating income 
overall  our raw materials costs decreased percent from to  primarily in ethylene  chlorine and natural gas 
ihs reported that industry prices for the year ended december  for our primary feedstocks ethylene  chlorine and natural gas decreased percent  percent and percent  respectively  when compared to the year ended december  our chlorovinyls operating rate was approximately percent for both and building products segment net sales 
net sales totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of percent compared to million for the year ended december  flat with prior year on a constant currency basis 
the net sales decrease was a result of lower sales volume in the us  in part due to the closure of the fence product line in march  partially offset by higher demand in canada and the benefit of additional net sales in resulting from the acquisition of exterior portfolio in february on a constant currency basis and adjusting for the closure of the fence product line and the exterior portfolio acquisition  net sales for the year increased percent while volume was flat with for the year ended december   our building products segment geographical sales to the us and canada were percent and percent  respectively  which is consistent with the same period in operating income 
operating income of million for the year ended december  increased by million from operating income of million for the year ended december  the improvement in operating income was driven by improved gross margin due to lower raw materials costs and restructuring charges being million less than the prior year  partially offset by higher compensation and selling costs 
restructuring costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the costs included million of asset impairment charges and million in severance and other exit restructuring costs  primarily related to a restructuring plan we initiated in our building products segment the building products restructuring plan 
this plan included i the shutdown of a plant in milford  indiana  ii discontinuing the fence product line  and iii the consolidation of three plants  two in the window and door profiles business and one in the pipe business

our cumene sales volume increase was due to increased contract sales as well as some opportunistic spot sales 
our phenol and acetone sales volume decrease was due to decreased phenol export sales due to weaker demand in asia during our overall average sales price decreased as a result of a percent reduction in the price of cumene  partially offset by a percent increase in the price of phenol and acetone 
the overall sales price decreases reflect lower costs for the feedstock propylene when comparing to operating income 
operating income increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase in operating income when comparing to was due primarily to a decrease in our raw materials costs and an increase in cumene sales volume that more than offset sales price decreases for some of our aromatics products and a decrease in phenol and acetone sales volumes

under our new abl revolver  we had a maximum borrowing capacity of million and  as of january   a remaining availability of million  with million in outstanding letters of credit and million in outstanding borrowings 
borrowings under the new abl revolver  if any  are at variable interest rates and  at january   outstanding borrowings under the new abl revolver bore interest at an effective interest rate of percent per annum 
our short term borrowings are expected to consist of amounts outstanding under our new abl revolver 
management believes  based on current and projected levels of operations and conditions in our markets and cash flow from operations  together with our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability to borrow under our new abl revolver  we have adequate funding for the foreseeable future to make required payments of interest on our debt  fund our operating needs  working capital and capital expenditure requirements and comply with the financial ratios in our debt agreements 
we have no required payments of principal on our debt until january to the extent our cash flow and liquidity exceeds the levels necessary for us to make required payments on our debt  fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and comply with our new abl revolver  we may use the excess liquidity to further grow our business through investments or acquisitions  payment of dividends and or to further reduce our debt by repaying the term facility or amounts outstanding under our new abl revolver 
during fiscal  cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of the use of million for the early redemption and repayment of debt  including i the redemption in april of all of our percent senior notes due and percent senior notes due that remained outstanding for the aggregate principal amount of million  and ii the redemption in october of all of our percent senior subordinated notes due for the aggregate principal amount of million  including early redemption cost 
the redemption of these notes required payments on original issuance discounts and retirement premiums that are included in the million loss on redemption and other debt cost 
during december  we repaid in full our other note payable for million 
we also used million of cash primarily for the modification of the prior abl revolver to remove the million block on availability and to extend the maturity of the prior abl revolver until cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the previous year  primarily related to the million full repayment of the borrowings under the prior abl revolver

purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable  legally binding and specify all significant terms 
we have certain long term raw material supply contracts and energy purchase agreements with various terms extending through these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply for our normal requirements 
amounts are based upon contractual raw material volumes and market rates as of december  these amounts do not include the following purchase obligations related to the merged business amounts representing the commitment of merged business to purchase electricity and steam from rs cogen  an entity in which we own a percent interest as a result of the transactions 
the amount of these total commitments of the merged business to rs cogen over the periods set forth above was approximately million as of december  unconditional purchase commitments  such as principally take or pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials  including industrial gases  natural gas  coal and electricity  consistent with customary industry practices

on february  and february   we accepted in the tender offer million and million  respectively  in aggregate principal amount of outstanding percent notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the applicable tender deadlines 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes  together with cash on hand  to repurchase the percent notes that were tendered in the tender offer for an aggregate tender price of million  including a make whole payment of million 
we also entered into a supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the percent notes with the trustee thereunder following receipt of consents of the requisite holders of the percent notes  which removed substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and other provisions in the indenture governing the percent notes 
in addition  on february   we delivered an irrevocable notice of redemption with respect to all percent notes that remain outstanding following the expiration of the tender offer and the purchase of all percent notes validly tendered 
pursuant to the redemption notice and the terms of the indenture governing the percent notes  we will redeem the percent notes that remain outstanding on or before march  following such redemption  our payment obligations under the indenture governing the percent notes will be terminated

we lease railcars  storage terminals  computer equipment  automobiles and warehouse and office space under non cancelable operating leases with varying maturities through the year we did not have significant capital lease obligations as of december  amounts do not include approximately million of operating leases representing the minimum rental commitments of the merged business under non cancellable operating leases with varying maturities through page of 
table of contents expected pension contributions and post retirement benefit obligations 
pension funding represents the projected minimum required contributions as of december  based on current assumptions for the axiall corporation retirement plan in accordance with the employee retirement income security act 
contributions for the us supplemental executive retirement agreements are also included 
these amounts do not include substantial tax qualified and non tax qualified pension obligations we will assume related to employees and retirees of the merged business 
as a result of the transactions  we will assume substantial tax qualified and non tax qualified pension obligations related to employees and retirees of the merged business 
in connection therewith  the legally required level of pension assets will be transferred from the tax qualified ppg pension plans to the new pension plans to be established by us in respect of those liabilities 
in addition to the standard minimum funding requirements  the pension act as amended by the worker  retiree and employer recovery act of requires companies with tax qualified defined benefit pension plans to make contributions to such plans as frequently as quarterly in order to meet the funding target for such plans  as defined in the pension act 
the accounting for the transactions  including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities  is not yet complete given the limited amount of time since the closing date 
the preliminary estimated fair value of pension investment assets related to the merged business and assumed by us upon the consummation of the transactions was million as of january  as of the same date  our estimated preliminary projected benefit obligation with respect to these assets was million 
the unfunded status of the us and canadian pension obligations assumed by us calculated on a projected benefit obligation basis as of january   was approximately million 
the unfunded other post retirement benefit obligations assumed by us as of january   were approximately million 
we estimate that we will fund approximately million to million to the assumed pension and other post retirement benefit plans for the year ended december  weighted average discount rates for the january  transfer are estimated to be and respectively for pension and other post retirement benefits and the weighted average initial health care trend rates are assumed to be declining to over years 
a basis point increase to the january discount rates assumed at close would decrease the estimated benefit obligations for the us and canadian pension and post retirement plans transferred from ppg by million  whereas a basis point decrease would increase the estimated benefit obligations by million 
if the assumed health care trend rates were lower or higher the estimated post retirement benefit obligations for the transferred us and canadian post retirement plans would decrease the obligations by million or increase them by million 
given the amount of pension assets transferred from the tax qualified ppg pension plans to the new pension plans to be established by us  and subject to the foregoing variables and the uncertainties associated therewith  it is possible that we could be required to make substantial contributions in future years to the new pension plans 
these contributions could restrict available cash for our operations  capital expenditures and other requirements and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  the nonqualified pension liabilities to be assumed by us are unfunded and no assets will be transferred by ppg to us in respect of these liabilities 
these obligations will require annual funding that could restrict cash available to us for other purposes 
lease financing obligations 
we lease land and buildings for certain of our canadian manufacturing facilities under leases with varying maturities through the year asset retirement obligation 
we have recognized a liability for the present value of cost we estimate we will incur to retire certain assets 
the amount reported in the table above represents the page of 
table of contents undiscounted estimated cost to retire such assets 
amounts do not include approximately million representing a legal obligation of the merged business associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that was incurred upon the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of that long lived asset 
uncertain income tax positions 
we have recognized a liability for our unrecognized uncertain income tax positions of approximately million as of december  we do not believe we are likely to pay any amounts during the year ended december  the ultimate resolution and timing of payment for remaining matters continues to be uncertain and are  therefore  excluded from the above table 
outlook we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of a number of macro economic and industry trends 
we expect that north america natural gas cost advantage over oil based economies in other parts of the world will persist for many years and continue to provide a competitive cost advantage to us 
we expect this advantage to allow consistent access to growing export markets for both chlorine  in the form of pvc  and caustic soda 
in addition  a sustainable recovery of the us housing market  both in terms of starts and renovation activity  seems to have begun 
we believe this should drive building products volumes higher 
we expect the combination of these factors to increase vinyl demand 
as a result  we expect operating rates and margins to move higher for north american producers 
margins have typically improved as the industry operating rates start to exceed the level in vinyl on a more regular basis 
we expect chlorine and caustic demand growth over the next few years to offset any net new capacity added in north america 
this balance  combined with the natural gas cost advantage  should support healthy margins for our north american operations 
inflation the most significant component of our cost of sales is raw materials  which include basic oil based commodities and natural gas or derivatives thereof 
the costs of raw materials and natural gas are based primarily on market forces and have not been significantly affected by inflation 
inflation has not had a material impact on our sales or income from operations 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  which amends asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements under gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this standard gives clarification for the highest and best use valuation concepts 
the asu also provides guidance on fair value measurements relating to instruments classified in stockholders equity and instruments managed within a portfolio 
further  asu clarifies disclosures for financial instruments categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy that require companies to provide quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  the sensitivity of the measurement to changes in those inputs  and the valuation processes used by the reporting entity 
early adoption is not permitted 
implementation of this standard was effective in the first fiscal year beginning after december  the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  which amends asc topic  comprehensive income 
this amendment gives entities the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income  either in a single page of 
table of contents continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
entities will no longer be allowed to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this amendment also required the entity to present on the face of its financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income 
however in december  the fasb issued asu which deferred this requirement 
during the deferral period  companies are required to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements 
also during this deferral period  companies will not be required to separately present or disclose the reclassification adjustments in net income 
as discussed below  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  as an amendment to this standard in february all other requirements in asu are not affected by asu early adoption of asu is permitted 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu which amends asc topic  an amendment to asc topic this amendment requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
implementation of this standard will be required for reporting periods beginning after december  implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu which amends asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the amendments in this asu give companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if a company concludes that this is the case  it must perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  a company is not required to perform this two step test 
under the amendments in this asu  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
early adoption is permitted 
implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  which amends asc topic  balance sheet disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the objective of this amendment is to provide enhanced disclosures that will enable users of an entity financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity financial position 
this includes the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with an entity recognized assets and recognized liabilities within the scope of this update 
the amendment requires enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either i offset in accordance with asc or asc  or ii subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
implementation of this standard is required for fiscal years beginning on or after january  we are currently evaluating the amendment  but do not expect implementation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  clarifying the scope and disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which amends asc topic the disclosures required by the amendments are page of 
table of contents the result of a joint project between the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb 
the main objective in developing the amendments is to address implementation issues about the scope of asu  to provide more clarity about offsetting assets and liabilities  reduce diversity in application and provide users of financial information more comparability as it relates to certain reconciling differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and those financial statements prepared under ifrs 
the amendments clarify that the scope of the disclosures under gaap is limited to include derivatives accounted for in accordance with topic  including bifurcated embedded derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with section or section or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
implementation of this standard is required for fiscal years beginning on or after january  we are currently evaluating the amendment  but do not expect implementation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets 
our long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and assumptions for operational performance of our businesses 
the assumptions used to estimate our future undiscounted cash flows are predominately identified from our financial forecasts 
the actual impairment charge incurred could vary significantly from amounts that we estimate 
additionally  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long lived assets of our businesses are impaired 
during and  we had long lived asset impairments charges  net  totaling a million recovery and a million charge  respectively 
the charge related to the further consolidation of manufacturing plants in our window and door profiles and pipe businesses and the closure of a manufacturing facility in milford  indiana 
the recovery is related to the final sale of property and equipment associated with the closure of the milford  indiana facility 
there were no long lived asset impairments charges during valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts specifically assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase accounting for business combinations 
other identifiable intangible assets include but are not limited to  customer lists  trade names and technology that are identified during acquisitions 
our carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually on october and at other interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying page of 
table of contents amounts could be impaired 
indicators of impairment that would give rise to interim testing include  but are not limited to significant declines in the markets and industries which buy our products  changes in the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units  changes in capital markets and changes in our market capitalization 
impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill consists of comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value 
our indefinite lived assets primarily consist of trade names 
the fair values of our trade names are estimated based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach 
this approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis 
impairment testing for goodwill is a two step test performed at a reporting unit level 
the first step is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
our goodwill evaluations utilized discounted cash flow analyses and market multiple analyses in estimating fair value 
our weighting of the discounted cash flow and market approaches varies by each reporting unit based on factors specific to each reporting unit 
inherent in our fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows  including interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions  overall economic conditions and our strategic operational plans with regard to our operations 
a change in any of these assumptions may cause a change in the results of the analyses performed 
in addition  to the extent significant changes occur in market conditions  overall economic conditions or our strategic operational plan  it is possible that goodwill  not currently impaired  may become impaired in the future 
we have two segments that contain reporting units with goodwill and intangible assets 
the chlorovinyls segment includes goodwill in our compound reporting unit and the building products segment includes goodwill primarily from our window and door profiles and siding reporting units 
based on the results of our evaluation in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test as of our measurement date  october   we did not record an impairment charge to goodwill in the estimated fair value of our compound and siding reporting units exceeds the carrying value by more than percent 
our window and door reporting unit fair value also exceeded its carrying value by more than percent 
its future earnings are significantly influenced by a recovery in the north american housing and industrial construction markets 
based on our sensitivity analysis  a percent decrease in our annual earnings before interest and tax margin assumption or a greater than percent decrease in our terminal multiple assumption used in our cash flow models for our window and door reporting unit could result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value 
this would require us to perform step two of the impairment testing 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item for further details of the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment test 
we did not have any impairment to our goodwill and other intangible assets in  or environmental and legal accruals 
in our determination of the estimates relating to ongoing environmental costs and legal proceedings see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item  we consult with our advisors consultants  engineers and attorneys 
such consultation provides us with the information on which we base our judgments on these matters and under which we accrue an expense when it has been determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available to us  the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates by percent prior to the consummation of the transactions  our net income would be higher or lower by approximately million  on an after tax basis 
page of 
table of contents pension liabilities 
accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match  for each employee  that estimated cost to the period worked 
to accomplish this  we make assumptions about discount rates  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  salary increases  employee turnover and mortality rates  among others 
we reevaluate all assumptions annually with our independent actuaries taking into consideration existing and forecasted economic conditions and our investment policy and strategy with regard to managing the plans 
we believe our estimates  the most significant of which are stated below  to be reasonable 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be effectively settled 
we determined our discount rate by matching the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed rate debt instruments 
the discount rate assumption used for determining annual pension expense for our us pension plans in was percent 
at december   this rate was percent for determining annual pension expense for our us pension plans 
a basis point increase or decrease in this discount rate would immaterially decrease or increase our annual pre tax pension expense for our us pension plans for the year ended december  in addition to the expense  prior to the consummation of the transactions  a basis point increase in our discount rate would decrease our year end benefit obligations by million  whereas a basis point decrease would increase our year end benefit obligations by million for our us pension plans 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan investment portfolio 
our weighted average asset allocation as of december   is percent equity securities  percent debt securities  percent real estate and percent other 
assumed projected rates of return for each of the plan projected asset classes were selected by us after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes 
the expected long term rate of return assumption used for determining annual pension expense for was percent for our us pension plans 
at december   this rate was percent for determining annual pension expense for our us pension plans 
prior to the consummation of the transactions  a basis point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase our annual pre tax pension expense by million for our us pension plans 
stock based compensation 
all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of stock options  restricted and deferred stock units  restricted stock and employee stock purchase rights are required to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
the fair value of each share based payment award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock based payment awards subject primarily to service vesting criteria 
we also use monte carlo simulation models to estimate the fair value of certain performance share based payment awards 
the fair values generated by these models may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our awards as models do not consider certain factors important to our awards  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards utilizing the black scholes and monte carlo models is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use the historical volatility for our stock  as we believe that historical volatility is more representative than implied volatility 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is page of 
table of contents based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our historical dividend yield and expectation of future dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted and deferred stock units and restricted stock are based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
at december  and  we had a net deferred tax liability balance of million and million  respectively 
our net deferred tax liability includes a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in evaluating the ability to realize our deferred tax assets we rely on forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results and the reversal of existing temporary differences 
at december  and  we had deferred tax assets for state tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  which carryforward indefinitely 
we believe we will achieve taxable income in the related jurisdictions in order to realize the deferred tax assets for state tax credit carryforwards 
in addition  at december  we had deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and canada of million and million  respectively  of which we have a million valuation allowance to record these deferred tax assets related to net operating losses at their estimated realizable values 
our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to certain deferred tax assets 
we increased the valuation allowance attributable to certain canadian deferred tax assets by million in due mainly to an increase in investment tax credits in the relevant canadian entities 
in  we increased the valuation allowance attributable to certain canadian deferred tax assets by million in due to operating losses in the relevant canadian entities 
in  we released approximately million of previously established valuation allowance attributable to certain canadian deferred tax assets which offset our deferred income tax provision in canada 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods  projected taxable income and tax planning strategies available to us in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize the deferred tax assets  we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code 
at december   based on the level of historical cumulative losses  management believes it is more likely than not  that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances 
page of 
table of contents we account for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with asc topic  accounting for income taxes 
asc topic prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under asc topic  we recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based upon the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
conversely  we derecognize a previously recognized tax position in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold will initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
we also recognize interest expense by applying a rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with asc topic and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we classify interest expense and related penalties  if any  with respect to our uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes 
as of december  and  our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits was approximately million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  related to accrued interest and penalties 
if recognized  million of this amount would affect our effective tax rate 
for each of the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of additional interest expense in our income tax provision related to our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
during  it is reasonably possible that uncertain tax positions in the us and canada will be recognized as a result of the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations 
the aggregate amount of these positions is approximately million 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality 
these regulations  which are enforced principally by the epa and comparable state agencies  govern the management of solid hazardous waste  emissions into the air and discharges into surface and underground waters  as well the manufacture of chemical substances 
our canadian operations are subject to similar laws and regulations 
we believe that we are in material compliance with all current environmental laws and regulations 
we estimate that any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with these requirements will not materially affect earnings or cause us to exceed our level of anticipated capital expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that regulatory requirements will not change  and it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate cost of compliance resulting from any such changes 
on february   the epa issued its final rule to update emissions limits for air toxics from pvc production 
the rule  known as the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for polyvinyl chloride and copolymers production  was published in the federal register on april  the rule establishes new  more stringent  emission standards for certain regulated hazardous air pollutants  including vinyl chloride monomer 
the rule sets mact standards for major sources of pvc production 
the final rule also establishes certain working practices  as well as monitoring  reporting and recordkeeping requirements 
existing sources that become subject to those requirements would have three years from the effectiveness of the rule to come into compliance 
the final rule was promulgated following extensive input from a variety of stakeholders  including industry participants  during the formal comment period  as well as several scheduled public hearings 
following the publication of the rule in the federal register  legal challenges were filed by the vinyl industry trade organization  several vinyl manufacturers and several environmental groups 
these legal challenges will likely impact the timing of the implementation of a final rule 
we have conducted a preliminary page of 
table of contents evaluation of the potential impact of a final rule on our operations 
this preliminary evaluation is based on the final rule as it currently exists  as well as a number of assumptions concerning the equipment and process changes that would be necessary to come into compliance with the existing final rule 
based on this preliminary evaluation  we expect that the capital expenditures necessary to achieve compliance with the existing final rule would be less than million 
for a further discussion about environmental matters that may impact our businesses and operations  see the following risk factors set forth in item a 
risk factors our operations and assets are subject to extensive environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  the costs associated with compliance with these regulations could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and the failure to comply could expose us to material liabilities and recent heightened interest in environmental related issues could require us to incur significant compliance costs or result in material operating restrictions  as well as the information in item business under the caption environmental regulation and item legal proceedings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks related to long term financing and derivative financial instruments  related to foreign currency exchange rates and raw material commodity prices 
these financial exposures are managed as an integral part of our risk management program  which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of the interest rate  exchange rate  raw material commodity and natural gas markets may have on our operating results 
we do not engage in speculative transactions  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk management 
the following table is forward looking information that provides information about our debt obligations and other significant financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
at times  we may utilize interest rate swap agreements to help manage our interest rate risk 
as of december  and we had no outstanding interest rate swaps 
as of december   our only variable rate instrument was our prior abl revolver which had no outstanding principal amounts 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the financial instruments 
in thousands thereafter total fair value at financial instruments fixed rate principal average interest rate in january we initiated the tender offer to repurchase the million outstanding principal amount of our percent notes 
on february  and february   we accepted in the tender offer million and million  respectively  in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding percent notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the applicable tender deadlines 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes  together with cash on hand  to repurchase the percent notes that were tendered in the tender offer for an aggregate tender price of million 
on february   we issued a redemption notice effective march  to redeem the percent notes that remain outstanding following the expiration of the tender offer 
in connection with the transactions  splitco incurred million of indebtedness under the term facility  which bears interest at a variable rate  and million of indebtedness under the splitco page of 
table of contents notes  which bear interest at a fixed rate of percent per annum 
in addition  in connection with closing the transactions  we borrowed approximately million under the new abl revolver  which bears interest at a variable rate  and million of indebtedness under the senior notes  which bear interest at a fixed rate of percent per annum 
we expect to continue to manage interest rates through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
we also may utilize interest rate swap agreements to help manage our interest rate risk  but we have no such swap agreements in place at this time and did not have any such swap agreements in place as of december  or foreign currency exchange risk management 
our international operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets 
we may or may not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options and cross currency swaps to hedge various currency exposures or create desired exposures 
as of december  and we had no outstanding foreign exchange swaps 
raw materials and natural gas price risk management 
the availability and price of our raw materials and natural gas are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors in global supply and demand 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  from time to time  we may enter into forward swap contracts  which are generally less than one year in duration 
we designate forward swap contracts with financial counter parties as cash flow hedges 
any outstanding contracts are valued at market with the offset going to other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable income taxes  and any material hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in cost of goods sold 
any gain or loss is recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the fair value of our natural gas forward purchase contracts was not material at december  and a million liability at december  we also have other long term supply contracts for raw materials  which are at prices not in excess of market  designed to assure a source of supply and not expected to be in excess of our normal manufacturing operations requirements 
historically  we have taken physical delivery under these contracts and we intend to take physical delivery in the future
