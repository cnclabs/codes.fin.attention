risk factors 
our business we own and operate commercial radio station clusters throughout the united states 
we believe we are the largest pure play radio broadcaster in the united states based on number of stations owned and operated 
at december   we owned or operated approximately radio stations including under lmas in united states media markets and operated nationwide radio networks serving over  affiliates 
at december   under lmas  we provided sales and marketing services for radio stations in the united states 
operating overview and highlights we believe that following the completion of the cmp acquisition and the citadel merger  which included the acquisition of our radio networks  consisting of  station affiliates and  program affiliates  in we have created a leading radio broadcasting company with a true national platform with an opportunity to further leverage and expand upon our strengths  market presence and programming 
specifically  with the completion of these acquisitions  we now have an extensive radio station portfolio consisting of approximately radio stations  including a presence in eight of the top markets  and broad diversity in format  listener 
table of contents 
index to financial statements base  geography  advertiser base and revenue stream  all of which are designed to reduce dependence on any single demographic  region or industry 
our increased scale has allowed larger  more significant investments in the local digital media marketplace allowing our local digital platforms and strategies  including our social commerce initiatives  to be applied across significant additional markets 
we believe our one national platform will allow us to optimize our available advertising inventory while providing holistic and comprehensive solutions for our customers 
cumulus believes that the capital structure resulting from the completion of the cmp acquisition and the citadel merger  and our related financing transactions  provides for increased liquidity and scale for cumulus to pursue and finance strategic acquisitions in the future 
we also believe that we have substantially completed our integration  and are now strongly positioned for future growth in what we believe is still a highly fragmented industry 
liquidity considerations historically  our principal needs for funds have been for acquisitions of radio stations  expenses associated with our station and corporate operations  capital expenditures  and interest and debt service payments 
we believe that our funding needs in the future will be for substantially similar matters 
our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under credit facilities in existence from time to time 
our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  demographics  or audience tastes  and fluctuations in preferred advertising media 
in addition  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us  which risks may be exacerbated in challenging economic periods 
in recent periods  management has taken steps to mitigate this risk through heightened collection efforts and enhancements to our credit approval process  although no assurances as to the longer term success of these efforts can be provided 
in addition  we believe the acquisition of the broad diversity in format  listener base  geography  advertiser base and revenue stream that accompanied the cmp acquisition and the citadel merger will help us reduce dependence on any single demographic  region or industry 
on december   we entered into an amendment and restatement the amendment and restatement of our first lien facility credit agreement  dated as of september   among the company  cumulus media holdings  inc  as borrower the borrower  and the lenders and the agents thereto the original agreement 
pursuant to the amendment and restatement  the terms and conditions contained in the original agreement remained substantially unchanged  except as follows i the amount outstanding thereunder was increased to billion  ii the margin for libor as defined below based borrowings was reduced from to and for base rate as defined below based borrowings was reduced from to  and iii the libor floor for libor based borrowings was reduced from to 
in the event amounts are outstanding under the revolving credit facility  the first lien facility requires compliance with a consolidated total net leverage ratio 
at december   this ratio would have been to such ratio will be reduced in future periods if amounts are outstanding under the revolving credit facility at an applicable date 
at december  we would not have been in compliance with this ratio 
as a result  borrowings under the revolving credit facility were not available at that date 
the second lien facility does not contain any financial covenants 
at december  our long term debt consisted of billion in total term loans and million in senior notes 
based upon the calculation of excess cash flow at december   the company is required to make a mandatory prepayment of million on the first lien term loan due within days of the filing of this annual report or form k 
this amount has been classified in the current portion of long term debt caption of the consolidated balance sheet 
the credit facilities contain provisions requiring the company to use the proceeds from the disposition of assets of the company to prepay amounts outstanding under the first lien facility and the second lien facility to the extent proceeds remain after the required prepayment 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of all amounts outstanding under the first lien facility  subject to the right of the company to use such proceeds to acquire  improve or repair assets useful in its business  all within one year from the date of receipt of such proceeds 
if and to the extent that the proceeds from the townsquare asset exchange are not otherwise reinvested within the applicable time period  the company will be required to prepay an equivalent amount of principal outstanding under the credit facilities in accordance with the terms thereof 
we have assessed the current and expected conditions of our business climate  our current and expected needs for funds and our current and expected sources of funds and determined  based on our financial condition as of december   that cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  interest and debt service payments  and repurchases of securities and other debt obligations through december  advertising revenue and adjusted ebitda our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations and networks 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by us 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by various ratings agencies on a periodic basis 
we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty and we believe that the diversification of formats and programs helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
in addition  we believe that the portfolio that we own and operate  which has increased diversity in terms of format  listener base  geography  advertiser base and revenue stream as a result of our recent acquisitions  including the cmp acquisition and the citadel merger  and the development of our strategy to focus on radio stations in larger markets and geographically strategic regional clusters  will further reduce our revenue dependence on any single demographic  region or industry 
we strive to maximize revenue by managing our on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand 
the optimal number of advertisements available for sale depends on the programming format of a particular station or program network 
each sales vehicle has a general target level of on air inventory available for advertising 
this target level of advertising inventory may vary at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time 
we seek to broaden our base of advertisers in each of our markets by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across each cluster of stations  thereby providing each of our potential advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group 
in the broadcasting industry  we sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
trade revenue totaled million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
local and regional advertising represented approximately  and of our total revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to local advertising revenues  we monetize our available inventory in both national spot and network sales market places using our national platform 
to effectively deliver our network advertising for our customers  we distribute content and programming through rd party affiliates in order to achieve a broader national audience 
typically  in exchange for the right to broadcast radio network programming  rd party affiliates remit a portion of their advertising time  which is then aggregated into packages focused on specific demographic groups and sold by us to our advertiser clients that want to reach the listeners who comprise those demographic groups on a national basis 
revenues derived from rd party affiliates in represented less than of consolidated revenues 
our advertising revenues vary by quarter throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our first calendar quarter typically produces the lowest revenues of a last twelve month period  as advertising generally declines following the winter holidays 
the second and fourth calendar quarters typically 
table of contents 
index to financial statements produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
we continually evaluate opportunities to increase revenues through new platforms  including technology based initiatives 
adjusted ebitda is the financial metric utilized by management to analyze the cash flow generated by the company s business 
this measure isolates the amount of income generated by the company s radio stations apart from the incurrence of non cash and non operating expenses 
management also uses this measure to determine the contribution of the company s radio station portfolio  including the corporate resources employed to manage the portfolio  to the funding of its other operating expenses and to the funding of debt service and acquisitions 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining our compliance with certain covenants contained in our first lien credit agreement  as amended and restated  the first lien facility 
in deriving this measure  management excludes depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense  as these do not represent cash payments for activities directly related to the operation of the radio stations 
in addition  we exclude lma fees from our calculation of adjusted ebitda  even though such fees require a cash settlement  because they are excluded from the definition of adjusted ebitda contained in our first lien facility 
management excludes any gain or loss on the exchange of assets or stations as they do not represent a cash transaction 
management also excludes any realized gain or loss on derivative instruments as they do not represent a cash transaction nor are they associated with radio station operations 
interest expense  net of interest income  income tax benefit expense including franchise taxes  and expenses relating to acquisitions are also excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda as they are not directly related to the operation of radio stations 
management excludes impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as they do not require a cash outlay 
management believes that adjusted ebitda  although not a measure that is calculated in accordance with gaap  nevertheless is commonly employed by the investment community as a measure for determining the market value of a radio company 
management has also observed that adjusted ebitda is routinely employed to evaluate and negotiate the potential purchase price for radio broadcasting companies  and is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining compliance with certain covenants in our first lien facility 
given the relevance to the overall value of the company  management believes that investors consider the metric to be extremely useful 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss income  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  follows in this section 
results of operations primarily as a result of the completion of the significant transactions described above in  cumulus believes that its results of operations for the year ended december  and  and its financial condition at such date  will provide only limited comparability to prior periods 
investors are cautioned to not place undue reliance on any such comparison 
revenues of million attributable to the acquisitions of cmp and citadel in are included in the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended december

direct operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase reflects the impact of a full year of direct operating expenses attributable to cmp and citadel 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase reflects the impact of a full year of additional depreciation and amortization expense from assets acquired in the cmp acquisition and the citadel merger 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation expense on assets within our legacy markets due to an increasingly fully depreciated asset base and a decrease of million in depreciable assets related to the townsquare asset exchange 
lma fees 
lma fees for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase relates to a full year of fees associated with the operation of stations in a divestiture trust associated with the citadel merger and additional lma contracts entered into during the year 
corporate general and administrative expenses  including  stock based compensation expense 
corporate  general and administrative expenses  including stock based compensation expense  for year ended december   decreased million to million  or compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily comprised of a million reduction of certain contractual obligations assumed in the citadel merger and a million reduction in acquisition costs since the prior year expenses contained those costs related to the cmp acquisition and citadel merger 
this was partially offset primarily by an increase of million in stock compensation costs for equity awards granted in late and early and a million increase in professional  legal  insurance and various other corporate facility related fees 
gain on exchange of assets or stations 
during  we completed an asset exchange with clear channel communications  inc  clear channel to swap our canton  ohio station for eight of clear channel s radio stations in the ann arbor and battle creek  michigan markets

we recorded an income tax benefit on continuing operations of million in as compared to a million benefit during the prior year 
the income tax benefit for is equal to the amount of tax expense on discontinued operations that is offset by the loss from continuing operations 
the income tax benefit for is primarily due to a release of the valuation allowance as a result of the cmp acquisition and citadel merger while the tax expense is primarily due to tax amortization of intangibles

intangible assets  net of amortization  were  million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
these intangible asset balances primarily consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill

we will continue to monitor whether any impairment triggers are present and we may be required to record material impairment charges in future periods 
our impairment testing requires us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth of our businesses 
additionally  fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairments tests are performed 
the following factors could adversely impact the current carrying value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill a sustained decline in the price of our common stock  b the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates  c a decline in our industry forecasted operating profit margins  d the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations  or e the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
excluding the impact of net revenues as a result of the cmp acquisition and the citadel merger  net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced political advertising following the mid term elections and a decrease in management fee income which had been earned by us for services provided to cmp prior to the date of the cmp acquisition  partially offset by an increase in core advertising categories  particularly automotive and retail categories

intangible assets  net  increased from the prior year due to the acquisitions of cmp and citadel in seasonality and cyclicality we expect that our operations and revenues will continue to be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results 
such variations could have a material effect on the timing of our cash flows 
in addition  our revenues tend to fluctuate between years  consistent with  among other things  increased advertising expenditures in even numbered years by political candidates  political parties and special interest groups 
this political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter

critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  our management  in consultation with the audit committee of our board  evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  self insurance liabilities  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 
accounts receivable and concentration of credit risks accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on several factors including the length of time receivables are past due  trends and current economic factors 
all balances are reviewed and evaluated on a consolidated basis 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
in the opinion of our management  credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and the geographic diversification of our customer base 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and believe that adequate allowances for any uncollectible accounts receivable are maintained 
intangible assets we have significant intangible assets recorded in our accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
we are required to review the carrying value of certain intangible assets and our goodwill annually for impairment  and more frequently if circumstances warrant  and record any impairment to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of those assets is more than their fair value 
for the year ended december   we recorded aggregate impairment charges of million  to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses  goodwill and definite lived intangible assets to their respective fair values 
as of december   we had billion in intangible assets and goodwill  which represented approximately of our total assets 
we perform our annual impairment tests for indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill during the fourth quarter 
the impairment tests require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
more specifically  the following could adversely impact the current carrying value of our broadcast licenses and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements goodwill a sustained decline in the price of our common stock  b the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates  c a decline in our industry forecasted operating profit margins  d the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations  or e the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations 
the calculation of the fair value of each reporting unit is prepared using an income approach and discounted cash flow methodology 
as part of our overall planning associated with the testing of goodwill  we have determined that our geographic markets are the appropriate unit of accounting 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the reporting units are based on currently available data and management s best estimates and  accordingly  a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the estimated values 
the use of different estimates could also result in materially different results 
we generally conducted our impairment tests as follows step goodwill test in performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill  the fair value of each market was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis  an income approach 
the discounted cash flow approach requires the projection of future cash flows and the calculation of these cash flows into their present value equivalent via a discount rate 
we used an approximate five year projection period to derive operating cash flow projections from a market participant view 
we made certain assumptions regarding future revenue growth based on industry market data and historical and expected performance 
we then projected future operating expenses in order to derive operating profits  which we combined with expected working capital additions and capital expenditures to determine operating cash flows 
for our annual impairment test  we performed the step goodwill test the step test and compared the fair value of each market to the carrying value of its net assets as of december  this test was used to determine if any of our markets had an indicator of impairment ie the market net asset carrying value was greater than the calculated fair value of the market 
the discount rate employed in the fair value calculations of our markets was for our step test 
we believe this discount rate was appropriate and reasonable for estimating the fair value of the markets 
for periods after  we projected annual revenue growth based on industry data and historical performance 
we derived projected expense growth based primarily on the stations historical financial performance and expected growth 
our projections were based on then current market and economic conditions and our historical knowledge of the markets 
to validate our conclusions and determine the reasonableness of our assumptions  we conducted an overall check of our fair value calculations by comparing the implied fair value of our markets  in the aggregate  to our market capitalization as of december  as compared with the market capitalization value of billion as of december   the aggregate fair value of all markets of approximately billion was approximately million  or  higher than the market capitalization 
key data points included in the market capitalization calculations were as follows shares outstanding  including certain warrants  of million as of december   closing price of our class a common stock on december  of per share  and total debt  including preferred equity  of billion  on december  utilizing the above analysis and data points  we concluded the fair values of our markets  as calculated  are appropriate and reasonable 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the table below presents the percentage within a range by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of different reporting units under the step test as of december  management s opinion is that the summary form of this table is more meaningful to the reader than presenting each reporting unit separately in assessing the recoverability of the reporting unit  including goodwill

for the remaining markets  since no impairment indicator existed in step  the company determined goodwill was appropriately stated as of december  step goodwill test as required by the step test  the company prepared an allocation of the fair value of the markets identified in the step test as containing indications of impairment as if each market was acquired in a business combination 
the presumed purchase price utilized in the calculation was the fair value of the market determined in the step test 
the results of the step test and the calculated impairment charge for each of those markets follows dollars in thousands reporting unit fair value implied goodwill value december  market id carrying value impairment market market market market indefinite lived intangibles fcc licenses we perform our annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles our fcc licenses during the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
we have combined all of our broadcast licenses within a single geographic market cluster into a single unit of accounting for impairment testing purposes 
as part of the overall planning associated with the indefinite lived intangibles test  we determined that our geographic markets are the appropriate unit of accounting for the broadcast license impairment testing 
as a result of the annual impairment test  we determined that the carrying value of reporting units fcc licenses exceeded their fair values 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges of million to reduce the carrying value of these assets in the year ended december  for the annual impairment test of our fcc licenses  including both am and fm licenses  we utilized the income approach  specifically the greenfield method  with the exception of two stations which were not operating as of the valuation date 
a minimum value of fifty thousand was estimated for the fcc licenses of these two non operating stations 
in completing the appraisals  we conducted a thorough review of all aspects of the assets being valued 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the income approach measures value based on income generated by the subject property  which is then analyzed and projected over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at the estimated value 
the greenfield method isolates cash flows attributable to the subject asset using a hypothetical start up approach 
the estimated fair values of our fcc licenses represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the estimated fair value also assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants  considering the use of the asset that is physically possible  legally permissible and financially feasible 
a basic assumption in our valuation of these fcc licenses was that these radio stations were new radio stations  signing on the air as of the date of the valuation 
we assumed the competitive situation that existed in those markets as of that date  except that these stations were just beginning operations 
in doing so  we bifurcated the value of going concern and any other assets acquired  and strictly valued the fcc licenses 
in estimating the value of the am and fm licenses using a discounted cash flow analysis we began with market revenue projections 
next  we estimated the percentage of the market s total revenue  or market share  that market participants could reasonably expect an average start up station to attain  as well as the duration in years required to reach the average market share 
the estimated average market share was computed based on market share data  by type ie  am and fm 
after market revenue and market shares have been estimated  operating expenses  including depreciation based on assumed investments in fixed assets and future capital expenditures  of a start up station or operation are similarly estimated based on industry average cost data 
appropriate estimated income taxes are then subtracted  estimated depreciation added back  estimated capital expenditures subtracted  and estimated working capital adjustments are made to calculate estimated free cash flow during the build up period until a steady state or mature normalized operation is achieved 
we discounted the net free cash flows using an after tax weighted average cost of capital of  and then calculated the total discounted net free cash flows 
for net free cash flows beyond the projection period  we estimated a perpetuity value  and then discounted the amounts to present values 
in order to estimate what listening audience share would be expected for each station by market  we analyzed the average local commercial share garnered by similar am and fm stations competing in those radio markets 
we may make adjustments to the listening share and revenue share based on the stations signal coverage within the market and the surrounding area population as compared to the other stations in the market 
based on our knowledge of the industry and familiarity with similar markets  we determined that approximately three years would be required for the stations to reach maturity 
we also incorporated the following additional assumptions into the discounted cash flow valuation model the projected operating revenues and expenses through  the estimation of initial and on going capital expenditures based on market size  depreciation on initial and on going capital expenditures we calculated depreciation using accelerated double declining balance guidelines over five years for the value of the tangible assets necessary for a radio station to go on the air  the estimation of working capital requirements based on working capital requirements for comparable companies  the calculations of yearly net free cash flows to invested capital  and amortization of the intangible asset the fcc license we calculated amortization on a straight line basis over years

we have a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other deferred tax assets will be realized 
should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of these net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination is made

upon adopting asc for awards with service conditions  a one time election was made to recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for options with service conditions only  the company utilized the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options issued 
for restricted stock awards with service conditions  the company utilized the intrinsic value method 
for restricted stock awards with performance conditions  the company evaluated the probability of vesting of the awards at each reporting period and adjusted

this standard gives clarification for the highest and best use valuation concepts 
this asu also provides guidance on fair value measurements relating to instruments classified in stockholders equity and instruments managed within a portfolio 
further  asu clarifies disclosures for financial instruments categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy that require companies to provide quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  the sensitivity of the measurement to changes in those inputs  and the valuation processes used by the reporting entity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   of our long term debt  or billion  bore interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the level of borrowings outstanding at december  at variable interest rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate payable on these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have increased decreased and net income would have decreased increased by million 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  in december  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with jpmorgan that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our variable rate borrowings 
this agreement caps the libor based variable interest rate component of our long term debt at a maximum of on an equivalent amount of our term loans 
this agreement is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
after giving effect to the impact of this agreement  we had billion of borrowings outstanding at december  that were not subject to the interest rate cap 
assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate payable on these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have increased decreased and net income would have decreased increased by million 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in certain prior periods  we managed our interest rate risk on a portion of our variable rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements in which we received payments based on variable interest rates and made payments based on a fixed interest rate 
these swap agreements expired on march  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate cap agreement discussed above  to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
foreign currency risk none of our operations are measured in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results are not subject to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets
