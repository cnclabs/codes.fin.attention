item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in connection with a transition in executive management and a refinement of business strategy  we have realigned our organizational structure which will result in new reporting segments north america services  north america products  international services and international products for the purpose of making operational decisions and assessing financial performance 
the new reporting segments will be effective  on a prospective basis  beginning on april  this is consistent with the proliferation of voice over internet protocol voip solutions and the adoption of unified communication technologies which has resulted in a trend toward convergence of voice and data networks 
we believe that  in the near future  the distinction between our voice and data solution offerings will not be significant and  increasingly  these services are bundled together 
as such  those historical voice communications and data infrastructure offerings will be aggregated into services in their respective geography 
we will report financial information revenue through operating income for these new reporting segments which should provide enhanced visibility and transparency into our operations  our business drivers and the value of our enterprise 
products and services platforms since our founding in  we have built robust communications based platforms that allow us to identify customer needs  and then design  source  implement and support the appropriate communications solutions 
our two platforms for serving customers and generating growth are as follows products platform our products platform is comprised of global sales and distribution  free technical support  custom solutions  same day delivery  lifetime warranties  quality control  global product management and sourcing 
the current products offered through the platform include but are not limited to switches routers  cabling infrastructure  cabinets and racks  wireless networking and digital signage 
the company generates technology products revenues from the sale of data networking products through its catalog  internet web site and direct sales 
in order to meet client demand  we keep a moderate level of inventory which consumes part of our working capital 
the market for these products is a highly fragmented and competitive 
the company has participated in this market for years and has earned a reputation for providing high quality products  rapid order fulfillment and free technical support 
with an average order size of less than one thousand dollars  the company technology products revenue is primarily driven by general information technology spending rather than capital spending 

table of contents we utilize a network of original equipment manufacturers oems and suppliers throughout the world 
each supplier is monitored for quality  delivery performance and cost through a well established certification program 
this network has manufacturing and engineering capabilities to customize products for specialized applications 
black box operates its own manufacturing and assembly operation at its lawrence  pennsylvania location 
the company chooses to manufacture certain products in house when outside sourcing is not economical 
sourcing decisions of in house versus third party suppliers are based upon a balance of quality  performance  delivery and cost factors 
services platform our services platform is comprised of our voice communications and data infrastructure offerings including engineering and design  network operations centers  technical certifications  local and national sales teams  remote monitoring  on site service teams and technology partner centers of excellence which includes specific sales and engineering resources around the technology 
the primary services offered through this platform include but are not limited to communications lifecycle services  structured cabling  unified communications  video av services  in building wireless and data center services 
for voice communications  the company revenues are primarily generated from the sale and or installation of new voice communications systems  the support of voice communications systems and moves  adds and changes mac work 
we periodically generate revenues from contracts performed over time that may result in an asset on our balance sheet for multiple periods constituting part of our working capital 
we have not experienced significant collectability issues related to such contracts 
sales of new voice communications systems and  to a lesser extent  mac work  are dependent upon general economic growth and our clients capital spending 
installed voice communications systems may be updated to provide users with increased unified communications functionality and integration with traditional data network applications such as email or messaging 
revenues from support contracts generally are not directly dependent on the economy as clients may seek to extend the life of their existing equipment and delay capital spending on new voice communications systems 
similarly  the company revenues for data infrastructure are generated from the installation or upgrade of data networks and mac work 
the installation of new data networks is also dependent upon general economic growth and our clients capital spending 
installed data networks may also need to be upgraded in order to accommodate the growing use of network technology 
similar to voice communications  data infrastructure projects can include mac work which is dependent on economic factors that are the same as those factors discussed above in relation to the voice communications business 
the company routinely competes against original equipment manufacturers  local or regional manufacturer specific channel partners in the voice communications and data infrastructure markets for enterprise clients 
the company believes that it favorably differentiates against this competition through its technology independent approach which draws the appropriate product from our portfolio of different partner solutions  broad geographic footprint and deep industry and technical expertise 
through its network of local offices and network operations centers  the company can provide clients with both on site and remote services 
management has initiated programs that it believes will leverage these platforms  introduce the company into new markets and increase the number of offerings that it can provide to its existing clients 
key differentiators our platforms introduce scale  flexibility and leverage to the business  and provide the following competitive advantages a diversified client base we have built a diversified client base that ranges from small organizations to many of the world largest corporations and institutions 
black box clients participate in many industries  including government  healthcare  business services  manufacturing  retail  technology and banking  among others 
revenues from our clients are segmented with approximately from large companies ie  revenues greater than billion  including federal governments  approximately from medium sized companies ie  revenues between million and billion  including state governments and approximately from small companies ie  revenues less than million  including local governments 
we strive to develop extensive and long term relationships with high quality clients as we believe that satisfied clients will demand quality services and product offerings even in economic downturns 
also  we believe that our distinctive portfolio of products and services will allow us to introduce additional offerings to satisfied clients 
key relationships with leading technology partners we have built long term relationships with all major communications equipment manufacturers and we are a top partner with the market leaders  including avaya  cisco  commscope  genband  mitel  nec  shoretel and siemens  among others 
broad geographic footprint we have built a global footprint of approximately offices serving more than  clients in approximately countries throughout the world 

table of contents deep organic resources we have approximately  team members world wide  approximately  of whom are technical and engineering talent who provide our clients with on site and remote capabilities 
dedicated sales force we have a team of over direct sales people world wide 
strong financial position we have a stable balance sheet and have generated positive cash flow for consecutive years 
strategic focus we believe that the services and products that we provide enable our clients to fully optimize their communications investment 
our strategy is based on the following core beliefs about our clients and the markets we serve enablement communication is an organization most important process 
when we enable it  we create value 
independence client focused solutions are better than channel focused solutions 
interoperability business leaders will choose best of breed solutions and require operational integration 
innovation a dynamic communications market requires partners and process to adapt and transform 
our overall business growth strategy includes the following four areas of focus strengthen and expand our portfolio of high value communication solutions 
leverage centralized expertise with local skills and relationships 
realign organizational structure and incentives 
implement a consistent  comprehensive market penetration approach 
we are actively operating programs that reflect our commitment to this strategy 
these programs will continue to diversify our offerings and will reflect client demand in the rapidly changing communications market

item a 
risk factors 
the following are some of the potential risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
you should carefully consider these factors  as well as the other information contained in this document  when evaluating your investment in our securities 
the following list of important factors is not all inclusive 
we are dependent upon certain key supply chain and distribution agreements 
we have significant arrangements with a small number of technology suppliers 
if we experience disruptions in our supply chain with these manufacturers for any reason or lose our distribution rights  we may not be able to fulfill client commitments with an acceptable alternative or we may not be able to obtain alternative solutions at similar costs 

table of contents we are dependent upon the demand for our products and services 
we and our competitors in the industry are dependent on the demand for the products and services that we deliver 
changes in technology or other unforeseen developments within our industry could result in decreased demand for our products and services 
we cannot guarantee that historical levels of demand will continue or increase in the future 
we face intense competition 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
our competitors  who include our technology suppliers and certain clients  may be able to deliver products and services at better prices or more quickly due to factors beyond our control 
new competitors may also emerge in the future  which may threaten our ability to sustain or grow our market share 
we cannot guarantee that we can continue to compete effectively in the future and still be able to sustain our historical levels of profit margin 
our financial results are dependent on our economic environments 
we  our clients or our vendors may experience economic hardships due to inflation or recession  changes in laws and regulations  business disruptions due to natural disasters  acts of terrorism or war or other factors that are beyond our control and that could negatively impact our financial condition or our ability to meet our future financial goals 
our revenue is dependent upon repeat client business and generally is not subject to long term contracts 
a majority of our revenue is generated through individual sales of products and services and less than twenty of our revenue is generated from long term maintenance contracts 
we depend on repeat client business as well as our ability to develop new client business to sustain and grow our revenue 
although our focus on delivering high quality sales and service has proven to be successful in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to grow or even sustain our current level of revenue in the future 
a significant part of our business involves public sector clients which provides unique risks 
approximately of our revenues is derived from sales to agencies and departments of federal  state and local governments 
legislatures typically appropriate funds for a given program annually 
these appropriations may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing priorities for appropriation  changes in administration or control of legislatures  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures 
a decrease in appropriations for certain programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our revenues from sales to these public sector clients are made through various direct contracts  through reseller agreements with government contractors and through open market sales 
government contracting is a highly regulated area 
failure to comply with regulations or contracts could subject us to fines  penalties  suspension or debarment from doing business with such clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to experience organic growth is dependent upon successful execution of new initiatives 
we have recently experienced a change in management  including a new chief executive officer 
in connection therewith  we have re aligned our organizational structure and have introduced new programs in order to better capitalize on internal assets and expertise  which we believe will enable us to introduce new product and service offerings as well as to support additional offerings for our clients resulting in increased revenues including organic growth and profitability 
the failure of these programs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase revenues and profitability 
we are dependent upon the successful integration of acquired businesses 
our future financial results are dependent on the successful integration of acquisitions within the projected timeframes and cost parameters 
we also face pressure to adequately conduct our ongoing operations while working toward the integration of acquired businesses 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully integrate our acquisitions as projected or without disruption to other areas of our business which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
we are dependent upon the retention of our key personnel 
the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain quality employees  executives and directors 
we offer comprehensive salary and benefit packages including long term incentives as a means of attracting and retaining personnel 
we face pressure to maintain our profit margins and remain competitive in our industry while we compete for personnel in our local markets with a variety of different businesses that may be able to offer more attractive incentives due to their individual financial situations 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract and retain personnel with our current incentives and at costs that are consistent with our projected profit margins 
we are dependent upon future mergers and acquisitions for a portion of our growth 
a key component of our growth strategy is through strategic mergers and acquisitions 
we may not continue to be successful in our search for potential acquisition candidates that are acceptable for our business model  or we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire new businesses that we have identified as attractive acquisition candidates 
we cannot guarantee that we will meet our projected growth targets in the future if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to acquire additional businesses 

table of contents our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately 
the efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems 
we rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data  communications  order entry and fulfillment and other business processes 
the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors  processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers  causing our business and results of operations to suffer 
in addition  our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control  including fire  natural disasters  power outages  systems failures  security breaches and viruses 
any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we can provide no assurance that we will continue to have adequate liquidity 
although we generate positive cash flow and have access to a significant amount of additional credit  we cannot be certain that our current liquidity situation will be adequate in future periods 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our positive cash flow position or to obtain additional credit or raise additional capital which may restrict our ability to operate or to pursue new business opportunities in the future 
we are subject to the risks of international operations 
we operate in countries outside of the united states 
our operations or our financial condition may be negatively affected by events surrounding our international operations such as changes in laws and regulations  political or economic instability  currency fluctuations  supply chain disruptions  acts of terrorism  natural disasters or other political  economic or environmental factors 
we cannot rely on the past results of our international operations as an indicator of future results or assure you that we will not be adversely affected by those factors inherent with international operations 
our stock price fluctuates 
our stock price is affected by a number of factors  including quarterly variations in our financial results 
as a result  our stock price is subject to volatility 
we have a significant amount of goodwill and could accumulate additional goodwill that could be subject to impairment 
as a result of our past acquisition program and given the service nature of our business  we have accumulated goodwill 
part of our current growth strategy is to acquire strategic companies in high growth markets and given the service nature of those future acquisitions  we will accumulate additional goodwill 
we conduct an impairment assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill at least annually and we monitor market conditions to determine if any additional interim review of goodwill is warranted 
deterioration in the market or actual results as compared to our projections or any reorganization of our business segments or under performance of future acquisitions could ultimately result in a future impairment 
in the event that we determine that our goodwill is impaired in the future  we would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations

all dollar amounts are presented in thousands except for per share amounts or unless otherwise noted 
the company black box is a leading communications system integrator dedicated to designing  sourcing  implementing and maintaining today complex communications solutions 
the company primary service offering is voice communications  the company also offers data infrastructure and technology products 
as of march   the company had more than  professional technical experts in approximately offices serving more than  clients in approximately countries throughout the world 
founded in  black box operates subsidiaries on five continents and is headquartered near pittsburgh in lawrence  pennsylvania 

table of contents with respect to voice communications  the company revenues are primarily generated from the sale and or installation of new voice communications systems  the support of voice communications systems and moves  adds and changes mac work as clients employees change locations or as clients move or remodel their physical space 
the company diverse portfolio of product offerings allows it to service the needs of its clients independently of the manufacturer that they choose  which it believes is a unique competitive advantage 
for the sale of new voice communications systems  most significant orders are subject to competitive bidding processes and  generally  competition can be significant for such new orders 
the company is continually bidding on new projects to replace projects that are completed 
new voice communications systems orders often generate an agreement to support the voice communications system  which generally ranges from years for commercial clients and years for government clients 
historically  such an agreement would result in a fixed fee model over a period of time  however  some of our clients are migrating toward a variable fee model based on time and materials over a period of time 
while this shift decreases our contractually obligated revenues and corresponding profits  the company believes the variable model  which is dependent on the clients need for our services  will generate revenues with similar profitability to the fixed fee model 
sales of new voice communications systems and  to a lesser extent  mac work  are dependent upon general economic growth and the company clients capital spending 
on the other hand  revenues from support agreements fixed and variable contracts generally are not dependent on the economy as clients seek to extend the life of their existing equipment and delay capital spending on new voice communications systems 
the company also has government contracts that generate significant revenues and are not as dependent on the overall economic environment as commercial clients 
maintenance and mac work revenues are also dependent upon the company history and relationship with its clients and its long track record of providing high quality service 
similarly  the company s revenues for data infrastructure are generated from the installation or upgrade of data networks and mac work 
the installation of new data networks is also dependent upon general economic growth and our clients capital spending 
installed data networks  however  may need to be upgraded in order to accommodate the growing use of network technology 
additionally  data infrastructure projects can include mac work  similar to voice communications  which is dependent on economic factors that are the same as those factors discussed above in relation to the voice communications business 
there is and has been a trend toward convergence of voice and data networks  in each of which the company has technical expertise which the company believes is a competitive advantage 
both the voice communications and data infrastructure businesses generate backlog which is defined by the company as orders and contracts considered to be firm 
at march   the company s total backlog  which relates primarily to voice communications and data infrastructure  was  of which  is expected to be completed within the next twelve months 
the company generates technology products revenues from the sale of technology products such as cables  switches and media infrastructure products through its catalog  internet web site and direct sales 
the sale of these products is a highly fragmented and competitive business 
the company has been in this business for over years and has developed a reputation for providing high quality products  free technical support  comprehensive warranties and rapid order fulfillment 
with an average order size of less than one thousand dollars  the company s technology products is less impacted by capital spending and more so by general information technology spending 
the company s technology products business provides additional distribution and support capabilities along with access to black box branded products to both the voice communications and data infrastructure businesses which provide cost benefits 
the company services a variety of clients within most major industries  with the highest concentration in government  healthcare  business services  manufacturing  retail  technology and banking 
factors that impact those verticals  therefore  could have an impact on the company 
while the company generates most of its revenues in north america  the company also generates revenues from around the world  primarily europe  such that factors that impact european markets could impact the company 
the company strives to develop extensive and long term relationships with high quality clients as management believes that satisfied clients will demand quality services and product offerings even in economic downturns 

table of contents the company targets strategic acquisitions which it believes will deepen its capabilities and expand market opportunity 
the company has completed several acquisitions from april  through march  that have had an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and  more specifically  north america voice communications and north america data infrastructure for the periods under review 
there were no acquisitions during fiscal fiscal acquisitions include i innerwireless  inc innerwireless  a privately held company headquartered in richardson  tx  services clients in every industry from healthcare to fortune enterprises and was the first black box acquisition in the rapidly growing in building wireless market and ii ps technologies  llc  a privately held company headquartered in dayton  oh  services clients in the healthcare and government verticals and was the first black box acquisition in the rapidly growing enterprise video communications market 
the only fiscal acquisition was logos communications systems  inc  a privately held company headquartered in westlake  oh  with an active client base which includes commercial  education and various local government agency accounts 
these acquisitions are collectively referred to as the acquired companies 
references to the acquired companies within our comparison of fiscal and fiscal are intended to describe the acquired companies from april  through march  references to the acquired companies within our comparison of fiscal and fiscal are intended to describe the acquired companies from april  through march  the results of operations of the acquired companies are included within the company s consolidated statements of operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates 
the company incurs certain expenses such as the amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions  restructuring expense  the goodwill impairment loss  the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the joint venture investment loss that it excludes when evaluating the continuing operations of the company 
the following table summarizes those expenses and their impact on operating income loss and income loss before provision benefit for income taxes for the periods presented fiscal amortization of intangible assets on acquisitions restructuring expense goodwill impairment loss impact on operating income loss change in fair value of interest rate swaps joint venture investment loss impact on income loss before provision benefit for income taxes fiscal vs fiscal summary in fiscal  revenues decreased by which  on a geographic segment basis  included decreases of in north america  in europe and in all other 
from a service type perspective  the total decrease included decreases of for data infrastructure  which includes a full year of revenues during fiscal from innerwireless whereas the prior year would have only included a partial year of revenues  for voice communications and for technology products 
our government primarily federal revenue vertical was down as a result of delays in funding as well as project and task order initiation and our commercial revenue vertical was down as a result of slower than expected economic recovery and sluggish client adoption of the rapidly changing communications technology for voice communications and lower it infrastructure spend and investment levels by our end customers for data infrastructure which is highly dependent on project oriented revenues 
we operate in the rapidly changing communication technology market which has inherent market risk 
economic recovery has not been as strong or as consistent in our markets as we had expected 
the changes in communications technology have been rapid  and client adoption has been weak 
our management team has responded by providing technology independent solutions to meet our clients evolving needs 
however  in recent years  we have not been able to create or sustain organic growth 
our response to the changes in our market needs to be decisive 
we occupy a unique position in the market and our relationship with our partners and clients provides black box with valuable insight into the future of enterprise communications 
we believe that communications is an organization most important process and that our clients are best served with a technology independent approach to meeting their communications challenges 
we also believe that enterprises will adopt best of breed solutions 
in response  our strategy includes four areas of focus strengthen and expand our portfolio of high value communications solutions 
as enterprise communications become more complex  we must be prepared to offer our clients the very latest solution alternatives 

table of contents leverage our centralized expertise with our local skills and relationships 
over time  we have built the most competitive footprint of local technical resources in the industry 
we can drive additional products and services through that platform by investing in centralized engineering and project management resources 
realign our organizational structure and incentive programs 
during the year  we announced leadership changes within our executive and operating teams 
these changes add focus and accountability to our business 
implement a consistent  comprehensive market penetration approach 
just as we can leverage our product and service platforms to serve our clients  we can also leverage our local resources more efficiently with focused centralized sales and marketing programs 
successful implementation of this strategy begins with a transition of our business to a more flexible organization that can adapt to the rapid changes in communications technology 
as such  the company has realigned its organizational structure which will result in new reporting segments north america services  north america products  international services and international products for the purpose of making operational decisions and assessing financial performance which will be effective  on a prospective basis  beginning on april  this is consistent with the proliferation of voice over internet protocol voip solutions and the adoption of unified communication technologies which has resulted in a trend toward convergence of voice and data networks 
we believe that  in the near future  the distinction between our voice and data solution offerings will not be significant 
as such  those historical voice communications and data infrastructure offerings have been aggregated into services in their respective geography 
we will report financial information revenue through operating income for these new reporting segments which should provide enhanced visibility and transparency into our operations  our business drivers and the value of our enterprise 
we believe that a successful transition will better position black box as a comprehensive communications system integrator where we can support our clients with multiple offerings 
as a first step in this transition  we are focused on leveraging our technology independent service model 
we continue to believe that our best of breed  client focused offering is a competitive advantage for black box 
with the broad service platform that we have built  we have the opportunity to enable all of our offices with access to a comprehensive portfolio of products and services 
the transition of our service model will include more client focused resources in the field  supported by centralized expertise 
during fiscal  we worked to align our organizational structure to enable our field with better access to technical expertise and partner resources 
also  we are realigning sales and account management incentives to promote new product penetration  in effect  driving focus and action to cross selling our portfolio of communications solutions 
we believe that these changes will enable us to efficiently and effectively introduce additional new product and service offerings over time and allow us to support multiple offerings for each of our clients which  in turn  should grow our revenues organically and could increase profitability as a result of new product offerings and efficiencies in the delivery model 
the transition that we are implementing is in response to a dynamic market 
although our voice centric approach has served us well  we recognize that the future of enterprise communications requires a more robust offering 
we expect our clients to continue to look to us for creative solutions and we  in turn  expect to deliver them 
as we transition  we will continue to be responsive to our clients evolving views on enterprise communications 
the changes that we have made during fiscal did not require significant additional investments 
however  we intend to make investments in sales and marketing efforts which could have an impact on our profitability in the near term 
while we have implemented a strategy to profitably grow our revenues in this rapidly changing communication technology market  the success of that strategy and our ability to grow revenues is dependent on a reasonable level of government spending  economic recovery along with it infrastructure spend and investments by our end customers and client adoption of rapidly changing communications technology 
there is no assurance that this strategy will be successful and any failure could impact our financial condition 
gross profit margins increased by to primarily as a result of competitive market conditions for voice communications and technology products 
the company believes that the addition of new services and products to its existing technology independent service model should result in stable gross profit margins 
operating income increased which was due to the goodwill impairment loss of  incurred in the prior year partially offset by a decrease in revenues 
operating income included  of restructuring expense which was incurred as a response to the continued weakness in our end markets to better align our costs with revenues in the form of headcount reductions and back office and real estate consolidation initiatives  we expect these actions to result in annualized savings of approximately million 
we will continue to evaluate all of our operating costs and investments to ensure an efficient and effective use of our resources 

table of contents as previously noted  certain of our selling  general and administrative expenses do not change significantly with changes in revenue 
as such  we believe that we can realize significant leverage from our selling  general and administrative expenses with increases in our revenues 
diluted eps increased due to the net after tax impact of the goodwill impairment loss of  incurred in the prior year as well as a decrease in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding partially offset by a decrease in revenues 
the decrease in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was the result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock noted below 
cash flow from operations decreased which was due to the decrease in revenues 
we returned value to our investors by repurchasing  shares of common stock for  paying  in annual dividends and investing  of capital expenditures to support our operational infrastructure

legal proceedings please see the matters discussed in part i  item  legal proceedings of this annual report  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
such estimates and assumptions may differ from actual results 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present the net balance that the company believes will be collected 
this allowance is based on both recent trends in certain accounts receivable specific reserve estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends in the entire accounts receivable pool general reserve 
the company computes a specific reserve by identifying specifically at risk accounts receivable and applying historic reserve factors to the outstanding balance 
the company computes a general reserve by reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying reserve factors based upon the age of the account receivable 
if the estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations reported for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents inventories the company s inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value and has been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records an estimate for slow moving and obsolete inventory inventory reserve based upon our product knowledge  physical inventory observation  future demand  market conditions and an aging analysis of the inventory on hand 
for convenience  we reduce inventory cost through a contra asset rather than through a new cost basis 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at some future date  the results of operations reported for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the inventory reserve 
deferred income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to events that impact the company s financial statements and tax returns in different periods 
deferred tax asset and liability balances are computed by identifying differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences which are multiplied by the current tax rate 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
if the company s estimate of the realizable deferred tax assets should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations reported for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the deferred tax asset allowance 
goodwill the company conducts its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the third quarter of its fiscal year  using data as of the end of the second quarter of its fiscal year 
goodwill is tested using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill net book value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment assessment  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment  the company uses an income approach to derive a present value of the reporting unit s projected future annual cash flows and the present residual value of the reporting unit 
the company uses the income approach because it believes that the discounted future cash flows provide greater detail and opportunity to reflect facts  circumstances and economic conditions for each reporting unit 
in addition  the company believes that this valuation approach is a proven valuation technique and methodology for its industry and is widely accepted by investors 
the company uses a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows  which vary for each of the reporting units and include i future revenue growth rates  ii future operating profitability  iii the weighted average cost of capital and iv a terminal growth rate 
if the company s estimates and assumptions used in the discounted future cash flows should change at some future date  the company could incur an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations reported for the period in which the impairment occurs 
in addition to estimating fair value of the company s reporting units using the income approach  the company also estimates fair value using a market based approach which relies on values based on market multiples derived from comparable public companies 
the company uses the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the market approach to validate the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the income approach 
fiscal the company conducted its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the third quarter of fiscal using data as of september  the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment  used to identify potential impairment  resulted in a surplus of fair value over carrying amount for each of our reporting units  thus the reporting units are considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
at march   the company stock market capitalization was below its net book value 
however  each of the company reporting units continues to operate profitably and generate cash flow from operations  and the company expects that each will continue to do so in fiscal and beyond 
the company also believes that a reasonable potential buyer would offer a control premium for the business that would adequately cover any difference between the recent stock trading prices and the book value 

table of contents future events that could result in an interim assessment of goodwill impairment and or a potential impairment loss include  but are not limited to  i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of or use of the assets or the company overall business strategy  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv a further decline in market capitalization below book value and v a modification to the company operating segments 
in connection with a new management team and a renewed business strategy  the company has realigned its organizational structure which will result in new operating segments for the purpose of making operational decisions and assessing financial performance which changes will be effective  on a prospective basis  beginning on april  this change in operating segments will affect the reporting units currently being used in the company annual goodwill impairment assessment 
although  at the present time  we do not expect a material charge as a result of the segment change  we provide no assurance that such a charge will not occur 
fiscal beginning in and continuing through the present time  the company has pursued a strategy to expand its technical capabilities and geographic footprint to include data infrastructure and voice communications in north america and data infrastructure in europe by acquiring over one hundred companies that resulted in recording goodwill on its balance sheet 
the north america and europe reporting units continue to operate profitably and generate positive cash flow from operations 
however  the fair value as of october   derived from a discounted cash flow model  of the north america and europe reporting units did not support the book value of goodwill recorded from those acquisitions 
the primary factors contributing to the difference in fair value to book value were an increased weighted average cost of capital for north america primarily driven by an increase in the risk premium associated with the company industry segment relative to a control group and lower profitability as a result of competitive market conditions for both north america and europe 
as previously disclosed  as a result of its annual goodwill assessment conducted as of october   the company  after consultation by management with the audit committee the audit committee of the board  recorded a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge of  during the third quarter of fiscal the impairment charge did not impact the company business operations  compliance with debt covenants or future cash flows  or result in any cash expenditures 
in determining the impairment charge  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill was compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill was determined as the residual between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its assets including any unrecognized intangible assets and liabilities as of the annual goodwill assessment date 
long lived assets other than goodwill the company reviews long lived assets including property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
no impairments of long lived assets have been identified during any of the periods presented 
loss contingencies the company incurs contingencies as a normal part of its business operations  such as future warranty obligations and potential liabilities relating to legal or regulatory matters 
the company accrues for contingent obligations when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognition within the company s technology products service segment  revenues are recognized when title to products sold passes to the client  which generally occurs upon shipment from the company s location 
within the company s data infrastructure and voice communications service segments  revenues are recognized from maintenance service contracts  mac work and network integration services when the services are provided 
service contracts are generally pre billed  recorded in deferred revenue within the company s consolidated balance sheets and are generally recognized over the service period on a straight line basis 
revenues from the sale and installation of products and systems are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized immediately in the financial statements 
the company has historically made reasonably accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  actual results could differ materially from those estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business that include interest rate volatility and foreign currency exchange rates volatility 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
the company does not hold or issue any financial derivative instruments other than those specifically noted below nor does it engage in speculative trading of financial derivatives 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its long term debt obligations 
as of march   the company had total long term obligations of  under the credit agreement 
of the outstanding debt   was in variable rate debt that was effectively converted to a fixed rate through an interest rate swap agreement discussed in more detail below and  was in variable rate obligations 
as of march   an instantaneous basis point increase in the interest rate of the variable rate debt would reduce the company s net income loss in the subsequent fiscal year by net of tax assuming the company employed no intervention strategies 
to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with the company s variable rate long term debt  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the re pricing characteristics of certain balance sheet liabilities so that the net interest margin is not  on a material basis  adversely affected by the movements in interest rates 

table of contents on june   the company entered into a three year floating to fixed interest rate swap  with an effective date of july   that was based on a three month libor rate versus a fixed rate and had a notional value of  which reduced to  on july  and terminated on july

changes in the fair market value of the company interest rate swaps are recorded as an asset or liability within the company consolidated balance sheets and interest expense income within the company consolidated statements of operations 
foreign exchange rate risk the company has operations  clients and suppliers worldwide  thereby exposing the company s financial results to foreign currency fluctuations 
in an effort to reduce this risk of foreign currency fluctuations  the company generally sells and purchases inventory based on prices denominated in us dollars 
intercompany sales to subsidiaries are generally denominated in the subsidiaries local currency 
the company has entered into and will continue to enter into  on a selective basis  foreign currency contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposure related to certain intercompany transactions  primarily trade receivables and loans 
all of the foreign currency contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the hedged forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings 
once the forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings  the effective portion of any related gains or losses on the cash flow hedge is reclassified from aoci to the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in the event it becomes probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  the ineffective portion of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge would be reclassified from aoci to the company s consolidated statements of operations
