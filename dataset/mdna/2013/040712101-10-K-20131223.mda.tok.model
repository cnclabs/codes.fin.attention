item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of september   the company owned and operated restaurants and bars  fast food concepts and catering operations  exclusively in the united states  that have similar economic characteristics  nature of products and service  class of customer and distribution methods 
the company believes it meets the criteria for aggregating its operating segments into a single reporting segment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
accounting period our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest september we report fiscal years under a week format 
this reporting method is used by many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year to year comparisons of operating results 
under this method  certain years will contain weeks 
the fiscal years ended september  and september  included weeks 
seasonality the company has substantial fixed costs that do not decline proportionally with sales 
the first and second fiscal quarters  which include the winter months  usually reflect lower customer traffic than in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
in addition  sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters can be adversely affected by inclement weather due to the significant amount of outdoor seating at the company s restaurants 
results of operations the company s operating income of  for the year ended september  decreased compared to operating income of  for the year ended september  this decrease resulted from a combination of factors including i decreased traffic at our properties in washington  dc due to poor weather and increased competition  ii increased competition and a decrease in the usage of complimentaries by the ownership of the casinos at our florida properties  iii professional fees related to the unsolicited bid made for the company by landry s  iv the negative impact of additional competition without a corresponding increase in overall traffic in las vegas  v the closure of our properties red and sequoia located in new york  ny in october as a result of a hurricane  and vi early operating losses in the amount of  at our new restaurant  broadway burger bar  at the tropicana hotel and casino in atlantic city  nj  all partially offset by strong catering revenues in ny combined with a significant improvement in the performance of clyde frazier s wine and dine  which opened in march the following table summarizes the significant components of the company s operating results for the years ended september  and september   respectively year ended variance september  september  in thousands revenues food and beverage sales    other revenue   total revenues    costs and expenses food and beverage cost of sales    payroll expenses   occupancy expenses   other operating costs and expenses   general and administrative expenses   impairment loss depreciation and amortization   total costs and expenses    operating income    revenues during the company s year ended september   revenues decreased compared to the year ended september  this decrease is primarily due to i a net decrease in same store sales of  as discussed below and ii the closure of our properties red and sequoia located in new york  ny in october as a result of hurricane sandy  partially offset by revenues related to our new restaurants in new york city  clyde frazier s wine and dine opened in march  and atlantic city  nj  the burger bar and grill at the tropicana hotel and casino opened in june 
food and beverage same store sales on a company wide basis  same store food and beverage sales decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  as follows year ended variance september  september  in thousands las vegas    new york    washington  dc    atlantic city  nj   boston   connecticut   florida    same store sales    other   food and beverage sales   same store sales in las vegas decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the negative impact of additional competition without a corresponding increase in overall traffic 
same store sales in new york which exclude the red and sequoia properties as they were closed in october increased as a result of strong catering revenues 
same store sales in washington  dc decreased primarily as a result of decreased traffic due to poor weather as compared to last year and increased competition 
same store sales in atlantic city decreased due to the continued decline in overall traffic in atlantic city  nj 
same store sales in boston were consistent from year to year as expected 
same store sales in connecticut decreased due to declining traffic at the foxwoods resort and casino where our properties are located 
same store sales in florida decreased due to increased competition at one of our properties combined with a decrease in the usage of complimentaries by the ownership of the casinos where our properties are located 
other food and beverage sales consist of sales related to new restaurants opened during the applicable period and sales related to properties that were closed during the period due to lease expiration and other closures and  therefore  not included in discontinued operations 
our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
other revenue the increase in other revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in purchase service fees 
costs and expenses costs and expenses from continuing operations for the years ended september  and september  were as follows in thousands increase year ended year ended decrease september  to total revenues september  to total revenues food and beverage cost of sales   payroll expenses   occupancy expenses   other operating costs and expenses   general and administrative expenses   impairment loss from write down of long lived assets depreciation and amortization   food and beverage costs as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  decreased as compared to the year ended september  as a result of improved menu costing partially offset by higher commodity prices 
payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  increased as compared to the year ended september  due primarily to severance payments to employees of closed properties 
occupancy expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  increased as compared to the year ended september  as a result of lower sales at properties where rents are relatively fixed partially offset by a reduction in costs related to properties that were closed as discussed above due to flooding from hurricane sandy 
other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  remained static as compared to the year ended september  a slight decrease in total costs were the result of i non recurring expenses in the prior period associated with one of our properties  and ii a reduction in other operating costs and expenses related to properties that were closed as discussed above due to flooding from hurricane sandy  partially offset by losses related to the closure of the two properties in new york combined with expenses associated with the opening of clyde frazier s wine dine in march during the year ended september   the company recorded a charge of  to impair the leasehold improvements and equipment of an underperforming restaurant 
general and administrative expenses which relate solely to the corporate office in new york city as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  increased as compared to the year ended september  primarily as a result of share based compensation and professional fees related to the unsolicited bid made for the company by landry s  inc partially offset by the inclusion of our former president s severance in the prior period in connection with his resignation in december income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes which are calculated on a separate entity basis 
most of the restaurants we own or manage are owned or managed by a separate legal entity 
for state and local income tax purposes  certain losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary income  with the exception of the restaurants operating in the district of columbia 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of income and losses incurred at individual subsidiaries 
our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the level of losses incurred at our new york city facilities which cannot be consolidated for state and local tax purposes  pre tax income earned outside of new york city and the utilization of state and local net operating loss carry forwards 
nevada has no state income tax and other states in which we operate have income tax rates substantially lower in comparison to new york 
in order to utilize more effectively tax loss carry forwards at restaurants that were unprofitable  we have merged certain profitable subsidiaries with certain loss subsidiaries 
the revenue reconciliation act of provides tax credits to us for fica taxes paid on tip income of restaurant service personnel 
the net benefit to us was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations 
we utilize cash generated from operations to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants  acquiring existing restaurants owned by others and remodeling existing restaurants we own  however  in recent years  we have utilized bank and other borrowings to finance specific transactions 
net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended september  was  compared to  for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in operating income as discussed above  partially offset by changes in net working capital 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  was  and resulted primarily from the purchases of fixed assets at existing restaurants  the construction of the broadway burger bar and grill in atlantic city  nj  the purchase of the florida membership interests and the investment in new meadowlands racetrack llc 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  was  and resulted from the purchases of fixed assets at existing restaurants and the construction of clyde frazier s wine and dine in new york city offset by net proceeds from the sales of investment securities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended september  of  resulted from the payment of dividends  principal payments on notes payable and distributions to non controlling interests offset by proceeds of  from the issuance of a note payable to a bank 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended september  of  was principally used for the payment of dividends  purchase of treasury stock and distributions to non controlling interests 
the company had a working capital surplus of  at september  as compared to a working capital surplus of  at september  we believe that our existing cash balances  cash provided by operations and availability of bank borrowings  as needed  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements at least through the next months 
on december   april   july  and october   the company paid quarterly cash dividends in the amount of per share on the company s common stock 
the company intends to continue to pay such quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future  however  the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the company s board of directors and is based on future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements  changes in us taxation and other relevant factors on june   the company entered into a year exclusive agreement to manage a yet to be constructed restaurant and catering service at basketball city in new york city in exchange for a fee of  all of which was been paid as of september  and is included in intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of september  
under the terms of the agreement  the owner of the property was to construct the facility at their expense and the company was to pay the owner an annual fee based on sales  as defined in the agreement 
as of september   the owner had not delivered the facility to the company and the parties executed a promissory note for repayment of the  exclusivity fee 
the note bears interest at per annum and is payable in equal monthly installments of  commencing on december  restaurant expansion on march   a subsidiary of the company entered into a lease agreement to operate a restaurant and bar in new york city named clyde frazier s wine and dine 
in connection with the agreement  the landlord contributed  towards the construction of the property which has been deferred over the lease term  which totaled approximately  the initial term of the lease for this facility expires on march  and has one five year renewal 
this restaurant opened during the second quarter of fiscal and  as a result  the consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  includes approximately  of pre opening and operating losses related to this property 
on november   a subsidiary of the company entered into an agreement to design and lease a restaurant at the tropicana hotel and casino in atlantic city  nj 
the cost to construct this restaurant was approximately  the initial term of the lease for this facility expires june  and has two five year renewals 
the restaurant  broadway burger bar and grill  opened during the third quarter of fiscal and  as a result  the consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  includes approximately  of pre opening and early operating losses related to this property 
on november   the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  ark rustic inn llc  entered into an asset purchase agreement with w and o  inc to purchase the rustic inn crab house  a restaurant and bar in dania beach  florida  for  plus inventory 
the acquisition is scheduled to close on or before february   subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence  execution of employment and non competition agreements  florida liquor authority approval and customary closing conditions 
the opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel  excess kitchen costs  costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre opening period and during a post opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally 
the amount of such pre opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened 
our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
we may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable  when they occur  depending upon the availability of financing and other factors 
cost method investment on march   the company made a  investment in the new meadowlands racetrack llc nmr through its purchase of a membership interest in meadowlands newmark  llc  an existing member of nmr 
in conjunction with this investment  the company also entered into a long term agreement with nmr to provide food and beverage services for the new racing facilities at the meadowlands racetrack in northern new jersey

the company did not reopen these properties as the underlying leases were due to expire in the second quarter of fiscal losses related to the closure of these properties  in the amount of  are included in other operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report 
below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the accounting estimates that require our most difficult and subjective judgments include allowances for potential bad debts on receivables  inventories  the useful lives and recoverability of our assets  such as property and intangibles  fair values of financial instruments and share based compensation  the realizable value of our tax assets and other matters 
because of the uncertainty in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including estimated future sales growth and estimated profit margins are included in this analysis 
management continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows  if any  related to underperforming restaurants 
periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets 
in such instances  we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values 
estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations  cash flows and or management judgment 
during the year ended september   the company recorded a charge of  to impair the leasehold improvements and equipment of an underperforming restaurant 
no impairment charges were necessary for the year ended september  leases we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including option periods as described below 
within the provisions of certain leases there are escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the option 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is expensed as incurred 
certain leases include both base rent and percentage rent 
we record rent expense on these leases based upon reasonably assured sales levels 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease terms for amortizing leasehold improvements as were used in calculating straight line rent expense for each restaurant 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different lease terms were used 
deferred income tax valuation allowance we provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized 
certain items  such as state and local tax loss carryforwards  are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies 
future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
goodwill and trademarks goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
trademarks  which were acquired in connection with the durgin park acquisition  are considered to have an indefinite life 
goodwill and trademarks are not amortized  but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
at september   the company performed both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of factors to determine whether further impairment testing is required 
based on the results of the work performed  the company has concluded that no impairment loss was warranted at september  qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations  overall financial performance and other relevant events  management expertise and stability at key positions 
additional impairment analyses at future dates may be performed to determine if indicators of impairment are present  and if so  such amount will be determined and the associated charge will be recorded to the consolidated statements of income 
share based compensation the company measures share based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes it as expense over the applicable vesting period using the straight line method 
excess income tax benefits related to share based compensation expense that must be recognized directly in equity are considered financing rather than operating cash flow activities 
the fair value of each of the company s stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of the company s common stock  the expected dividend yield of our stock  the expected life of the options and the risk free interest rate 
during fiscal  options to purchase  shares of common stock were granted and are exercisable as to of the shares commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant and as to an additional commencing on the second anniversary of the date of grant 
the company did not grant any options during fiscal the company generally issues new shares upon the exercise of employee stock options
