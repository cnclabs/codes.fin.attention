overview our summary operating results presented below are before the impact of income taxes  discontinued operations and amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests 
fiscal year results operating revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  driven by a million increase in wholesale and other revenues and a million increase in retail revenues 
operating income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million the year ended december  reflecting increased cost of sales and services and higher customer operations expenses  partially offset by higher operating revenues described above 
other expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to million in write offs associated with original financing costs and discounts and deferred financing fees in connection with our amended and restated credit agreement in compared to million in write offs associated with a repricing amendment and payment on the prior senior secured credit facility at the time of the business separation in income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased operating expenses and higher other expense described above 
for further detail regarding our operating results  including explanation of the non gaap measure arpu  see the other overview discussion and results of operations comparison of year ended december  and below 
market risks the telecommunications industry has been  and we believe will continue to be  characterized by several trends  including the rapid development and introduction of new technologies and services  including but not limited to g lte or other technologies 
a number of our competitors have deployed next generation technologies that are focused on the provisioning of mobile data services with higher speeds  which increasingly are becoming a critical component of many wireless service provider offerings 
we believe our continued success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services  such as higher speed data services  that meet customer demands 
the retail market for wireless broadband mobile services remains highly competitive 
we believe that competition for customers among wireless broadband providers is based on price  service area  brand awareness and reputation  services and features  handset selection  call quality and customer service 
in addition  the market for wireless services has increasingly required that we provide nationwide coverage to our customers  both for voice and data services 
we currently rely on roaming agreements  primarily with sprint and also with other wireless carriers  to provide service in areas not covered by our network 
these agreements are subject to renewal and termination rights  and if such agreements are terminated or not renewed  or the rates charged to us increase substantially  we may incur significantly higher costs for roaming service and we may be unable to provide competitive regional and nationwide wireless service to our customers on a cost effective basis 
as competition increases and technology evolves  federal and state regulation of the telecommunications industry continues to change 
we anticipate that this state of regulatory flux will continue in the future as the fcc and state regulators respond to competitive  technological and legislative developments by modifying their existing regulations or adopting new ones 
in addition  economic conditions may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
the continued impact of economic downturns on our customers  including unemployment and disruptions to the credit and financial markets  could cause customers to further reduce spending 
taken together or individually  new or changed regulatory requirements and the possibility of wide ranging changes and reform mandated by the federal and state governments to stimulate economic recovery  could affect the telecommunications industry and may harm our business and restrict the manner in which we operate our business 

table of contents we expect postpay competition to continue to be intense as the wireless market matures 
we must increasingly target switchers rather than first time purchasers of wireless services to expand our subscriber base 
in  we saw an increased emphasis by our postpay competitors on selling bundled services  which combine voice  text and data services offered on their respective wireless network including in some instances g lte or other technologies  as well as expanding nationwide services  often at reduced prices 
however  despite the increased competition and current economic climate  our postpay subscriber base increased nearly as of december  compared to december   while the prepay subscriber base expanded more than during the same time period 
we continued to use predictive analytics to identify high risk churn areas within our postpay and prepay customer bases  which leads to proactive communication and retention efforts  resulting in improved customer churn and positive net subscriber additions 
total combined churn  net decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and we realized net subscriber additions in each quarter of compared to net reductions in our subscriber base during each quarter of similar to other wireless competitors  we have increased our focus on data services  including smartphone and data centric devices 
the percentage of sales of smartphones increased to approximately of total postpay sales during  as compared to approximately in in april  we revised our postpay rate plan offerings  which we expect to continue to favorably impact our retail revenues in as customers roll off legacy service plans and upgrade to our new plans 
we continue to face risks to our competitive value position in the postpay market through reduced price nationwide voice plans  text and data plans offered by competitors such as at t  verizon wireless  sprint  t mobile and us cellular 
a number of other wireless broadband mobile carriers  resellers and mvnos are offering  and in the future may offer  service plans similar to  or competitive with  our service plans with more extensive geographic coverage than ours  better brand awareness  lower prices and other differentiating features 
we also expect the competition with prepaid products to remain strong as competitors have targeted the prepaid market as a means to sustain growth and increase market share 
a number of large wireless competitors  including boost and virgin mobile mvnos operated by sprint  tracfone s straight talk service  t mobile  net  simple mobile  and page plus  actively compete for prepay customers in our markets 
many of these competitors have access to big box retailers that currently are not in our distribution channel 
pricing competition in the prepaid market is intense  with a number of prepaid unlimited nationwide plans being offered for less than per month 
to remain competitive with our prepaid product offerings  we continually monitor our frawg unlimited wireless prepay product offerings 
in the first quarter of  we implemented prepay product plans that are tax inclusive which simplifies the payment process for the customer 
we then followed with a price reduction on our unlimited everything plan which now accounts for of all prepay customers 
we also continue to offer the frawg unlimited wireless product in all of our markets 
frawg is a simple  no contract  low cost service that has a minimum number of plans  offers attractive features  including smartphone options and provides regional or national unlimited coverage 
acquisition costs are substantially lower than postpay with the reduced handset subsidy and lower selling and advertising costs 
our prepaid strategic focus is to target the higher end of the prepaid market by offering more feature rich plans and devices that appeal to smartphone customers 
this strategy resulted in a smartphone take rate during the year ended december  and an ending smartphone prepay penetration of 
to increase gross subscriber additions and to better serve and retain our customers  we are focused on refining our distribution strategy with respect to both postpay and prepay sales 
we continued expanding our indirect distribution channel using master agents and exclusive dealers and increasing the points of distribution and the quality of the indirect locations 
during we also made significant improvements to our direct distribution channel with changes in the number of stores  store locations and upgrades to our stores in appearance and customer service functionality 
we believe these changes will continue to improve our postpay sales as well as bolster prepay sales productivity in revenues from our ntelos branded retail business improved during the past year  driven by increases in both the number of subscribers served and arpu 
our ability to grow our customer base and retain current subscribers will depend  in part  on our ability to adapt to changes in pricing plans  continue to improve our network coverage and reliability  and make available service offerings on the latest network technology and devices 
at the same time  these competitive factors could cause our churn to increase making it difficult for us to add net subscribers and may put downward pressure on our arpu in strategic network alliance we have an exclusive agreement with sprint spectrum  and sprint spectrum on behalf of and as an agent for sprintcom sprint spectrum and sprintcom collectively  sprint  which we refer to as the strategic network alliance 
under the strategic network alliance  we are the exclusive pcs service provider in our western virginia and west virginia service area to sprint for all sprint cdma wireless customers through july  for the years ended december   and  we realized wireless wholesale revenues of million  million and million  respectively  related to the strategic network alliance 
revenues from this contract exceeded the million monthly minimum beginning in october and we expect that our revenues will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
if sprint were to lose subscribers in our territory or take steps to reduce data or voice usage  our wholesale revenue would be negatively impacted 

table of contents under the strategic network alliance agreement with sprint  there are automatic rate resets in the agreement 
in the event either party believes any rate resets to be inconsistent with the terms of the strategic network alliance agreement  that party may dispute such resets in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement 
we have disputed sprint s data rate resets beginning with the fourth quarter of  which dispute continues to be reviewed and remains unresolved 
the final outcome of this unresolved data rate reset dispute is unknown at this time 
we estimate a reasonably possible outcome of the data rate reset dispute relative to the revenues that we have recognized beginning in the fourth quarter of to be approximately million in sprint s favor 
under our view of the agreement  we believe it is also reasonably possible that the outcome of the data rate reset dispute relative to the revenues that we have recognized beginning in the fourth quarter of is approximately million in our favor 
until the current data rate reset dispute is resolved  the range of outcomes will continue to increase 
during the year ended december   sprint also provided notice to us involving two asserted claims totaling approximately million that are isolated to historical billing issues unrelated to the current data rate reset dispute 
we strongly believe that sprint s claims are without merit 
although the company believes that it has substantial legal and factual bases related to its position in connection with the disputes and intends to vigorously pursue its claims in the context of its relationship with sprint  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail 
accordingly  the company has established an accrual of approximately million relating to such disputes 
it is likely that the company will increase the amount of such accrual in subsequent quarters until such disputes are ultimately resolved 
in addition  if one or more such disputes were adversely determined against the company  it could result in payments by the company to sprint 
other overview discussion to supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap  we reference the non gaap measure arpu 
we use this measure  along with others such as subscribers and churn  to gauge operating performance for which our operating managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance 
arpu is a telecommunications industry metric that measures service revenues per period divided by the average number of subscribers during that period 
arpu as defined below may not be similar to arpu measures of other wireless companies  is not a measurement under gaap and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the information contained in our consolidated statements of operations 
we closely monitor the effects of new rate plans and service offerings on arpu in order to determine their effectiveness 
we believe arpu provides management useful information concerning the appeal of our rate plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting and retaining high value customers 
the table below provides a reconciliation of operating revenues to subscriber revenues used to calculate average monthly arpu for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands  except average monthly arpu operating revenues less equipment revenues from sales to new customers less equipment revenues from sales to existing customers less wholesale  other and adjustments retail subscriber revenues average number of subscribers total average monthly arpu retail subscriber revenues less voice and other feature revenues retail subscriber data revenues average number of subscribers total data average monthly arpu arpu for the year ended december  increased to compared to for the year ended december   due to the introduction of new postpay plans and continued penetration of data driven devices such as smartphones on both postpay and prepay sales 
we expect arpu to continue to increase throughout as a greater percentage of our postpay subscriber mix migrates to smartphones  including the iphone  and existing subscribers transition from prior service plans to our new service plans 
table of contents introduced in data arpu  which is the portion of average monthly revenue per user associated with data usage and products  also increased during the year to at december  from at december   and we anticipate data arpu and data revenue will continue to grow in  primarily due to the continued increase in data plan penetration 
introduction of the iphone in april also served as a catalyst in data arpu growth through increased rate plan pricing as well as increased smartphone penetration 
data plan growth follows the percentage growth of customers with smartphones in relation to total customers  with this percentage increasing to as of december  from as of december  and postpay growing to as of december  from to as of december  
voice arpu continues to decrease across our industry and for us as subscriber trends shift to increased data usage  and may continue to decline in due to competitive pressures and economic conditions 
results of operations overview operating revenues our revenues are generated from the following categories retail consisting of subscriber revenues from network access  data services  feature services and equipment revenues  and wholesale and other primarily wholesale revenue from the strategic network alliance and roaming revenue from other telecommunications carriers 
wholesale revenues from the strategic network alliance are derived primarily from voice and data usage by sprint customers who live in the strategic network alliance service area home subscribers and those customers of sprint and its affiliates who use our network for voice and data services while traveling through the strategic network alliance service area travel subscribers 
other revenues relate to rent from leasing excess tower and building space 
operating expenses our operating expenses are categorized are follows cost of sales and services includes handset equipment costs which  in keeping with industry practice  particularly with handsets sold with service contracts  we sell to our customers at a price below our cost  usage based access charges  including long distance  roaming charges  and other direct costs incurred in accessing other telecommunications providers networks in order to provide telecommunication services to our end user customers  leased facility expenses for connection to other carriers  cell sites and switch locations  and engineering and repairs and maintenance expenses related to property  plant and equipment  customer operations includes marketing  product management  product advertising  selling  billing  customer care  customer retention and bad debt expenses  corporate operations includes taxes other than income  executive  accounting  legal  purchasing  information technology  human resources and other general and administrative expenses  including earned bonuses and equity based compensation expense related to stock and option instruments held by certain members of corporate management  accretion of asset retirement obligations  and expenses related to acquisitions and the separation of our wireless and wireline businesses  which we refer to as the business separation  and depreciation and amortization includes depreciable long lived property  plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets where applicable 
other expense other expense includes interest expense on debt instruments  corporate financing costs and debt discounts associated with the repricing and refinancing of our debt instruments and  as appropriate  related charges or amortization of such costs and discounts  changes in the fair value of our interest rate cap which expired in august and other items such as interest income and fees 
income taxes income tax expense and effective tax rate increase or decrease based upon changes in a number of factors  including our pre tax income or loss  state minimum tax assessments  and non deductible expenses

results of operations comparison of year ended december  and operating revenues the following table identifies our operating revenues for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands variance variance retail revenue wholesale and other revenue total operating revenues retail revenue retail revenue increased due to higher subscriber service revenues of million  or  and an increase in equipment revenues of million  or 
the increase in subscriber service revenues reflected a net subscriber gain and an increase in arpu 
net subscribers grew approximately  subscribers  or  to an average of approximately  subscribers for the year ended december  compared to an average of approximately  subscribers for the year ended december  during the latter part of  we introduced several initiatives to increase subscriber net additions  including improved targeting of high value  long term customers  resulting in net subscriber gains during arpu increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in arpu was driven by an increase in data revenues of million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  underlying this growth in data revenues was an increased sales emphasis on smartphones and other data centric handsets coupled with a broader array of data packages  leading to significant expansion of our customer base with smartphones  as of december  compared to as of december  the growth in data revenues was partially offset by a decrease in voice and other feature revenues of million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decline reflected a shift in customer preferences to fixed rate and data centric services 
higher equipment revenues for the year ended december  were driven by increased penetration of smartphones  including the iphone and s launched in the second quarter of and iphone launched at the end of third quarter of  which resulted in an increase in smartphone gross subscriber additions to of total gross adds for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  wholesale and other revenue wholesale and roaming revenues from the strategic network alliance increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase reflected increased data usage  measured in megabytes  which grew period over period for the year ended december   as the use of smartphones and data devices swelled  and the data usage from sprint subscribers in our territory increased 
under the strategic network alliance with sprint  there are automatic rate resets which could  and do  result in disputes from time to time  as discussed above 
roaming revenues from carriers other than sprint declined million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december

given the continued increase in smartphone penetration and the introduction of more technologically advanced and expensive handsets  we expect handset costs to continue to rise in also contributing to the higher costs was an increase in gross subscriber additions over the same period  which costs were partially offset by a million  or  increase in equipment revenues from new customers 
network access and cell site expenses increased million  or  reflecting an increase in the number of cell sites as of december  and additional access connectivity to support increased data usage 
data roaming expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  reflecting the continued growth and subscriber trends shift to increased data usage 
we expect that network access and cell site costs will continue to increase in as we continue to build new cell sites and increase our network capacity to handle the continued increase in data traffic 
customer operations customer operations expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  agent commissions increased million in  primarily due to a increase in indirect sales for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and sales incentives increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to contract buy out and referral incentives offered during the current year 
these costs were partially offset by a decline in bad debt expense of million  or  reflecting a favorable decrease in churn in due to tightening of our credit requirements  lower retention costs of million  and lower corporate retail and other direct channel commissions of million  or  due to the channel mix discussed above and compensation plan changes 
corporate operations corporate operations expense remained consistent for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increases in costs for the year ended december  included professional fees of million and regulatory fees of million 
corporate expenses for the year ended december  were reduced by million in transition services billed under the transition services agreement with lumos networks that was executed as part of the business separation 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses also remained consistent for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in december  the company decided to replace all remaining legacy xrtt base stations with new base stations that support ev do technology and implement other network enhancements  resulting in an adjustment to the applicable useful life for these assets 
we recognized approximately million in incremental depreciation expense for the year ended december  and expect to recognize approximately million in accelerated depreciation in in connection with this adjustment 
other expense interest expense on debt instruments decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the timing of changes in interest rates resulting from the repricing amendment on the prior senior secured credit facility on march   partially offset by increases in the new rates associated with the amended and restated credit agreement consummated on november  further information related to the amended and restated credit agreement is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

table of contents other expense  net increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to the write off of a proportionate amount of the unamortized deferred issuance costs and debt discount associated with our prior senior secured credit facility  which was refinanced on november  other expense  net for the year ended december  included million of deferred financing costs written off in connection with the payment on the prior senior secured credit facility at the time of the business separation and a million charge in the second quarter of related to the write off of original financing costs and discounts associated with the march repricing amendment 
income taxes income tax expense was million  with an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december   representing the statutory tax rate applied to pre tax income and the effects of certain non deductible compensation and state minimum taxes

we have certain prior year unused net operating losses  including certain built in losses  totaling million as of december  that are subject to limitations imposed by irc these prior year nols are subject to an adjusted annual maximum limit the irc limit of approximately million 
based on the irc limit  we expect that million of these prior year nols will be available for use as follows million in with the million anticipated carryover from and  million per year in through  million in and million in we also have a prior year nol of approximately million that is not subject to the irc limit and which has been carried back to a prior taxable year 
in addition  we realized a net operating loss of million in primarily as a result of bonus depreciation under the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of and the write off of certain deferred financing costs

results of operations year ended december  compared to operating revenues the following table identifies our external operating revenues for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands variance variance retail revenue wholesale and other revenue total operating revenues retail revenue retail revenue declined due to a decrease in subscriber revenues of million  or  partially offset by an increase in equipment revenues million  or 
subscriber service revenues were lower in reflecting a net subscriber loss of approximately  subscribers  or  from an average of approximately  subscribers during to an average of approximately  subscribers during in the second half of  we introduced several initiatives to increase subscriber net additions  including improved targeting of high value  long term customers  as a result  net subscriber losses were less than in the fourth quarter of voice and other feature revenues  excluding data revenues  decreased in by million due to several factors  including the decrease in the subscriber base and a decline in arpu for these services due to competitive pricing reductions and economic conditions 
partially offsetting the decrease in voice revenue was an increase in data revenue of million in underlying this growth in data revenue was the technology upgrade to ev do and an increased sales emphasis on smartphones and other data centric handsets coupled with a broader array of data packages  leading to a near tripling of the customer base with smartphones  from as of december  to as of december  wholesale and other revenue wholesale and roaming revenues from the strategic network alliance increased in by million  or 
this increase reflected greater data usage  measured in megabytes  which grew year over year  as the use of smartphones and data devices proliferated as well as an increase in sprint subscribers in our territory 
following a travel data rate reset in mid  monthly revenue from sprint was billed at the million minimum through september  however  calculated revenues from the strategic network alliance increased with significant usage growth and began to exceed the million monthly minimum beginning in october roaming revenues from carriers other than sprint increased in by million

we are a holding company that does not operate any business of our own 
as a result  we are dependent on cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments or to make other distributions to our stockholders  including by means of a stock repurchase 
as discussed above  amounts that can be made available to us to pay cash dividends or repurchase stock are restricted by the amended and restated credit agreement

other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts  which may affect our financial condition  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
for example  we are contractually committed to acquire handset equipment and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 

table of contents the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis as of december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the related disclosures 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgment on historical experience  current and projected business trends  general economic conditions and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions  and such differences could be material to reported results of operations and financial position 
we believe that the areas described below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management s most significant judgments in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
additional discussion of the application of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when services are rendered or when products are delivered and functional  as applicable 
certain services of the company require payment in advance of service performance 
in such cases  the company records a service liability at the time of billing and subsequently recognizes revenue ratably over the service period 
the company bills customers certain transactional taxes on service revenues 
these transactional taxes are not included in reported revenues as they are recognized as liabilities at the time customers are billed 
the company earns retail and wholesale revenues by providing access to and usage of its networks 
revenues are recognized as services are provided 
revenues for equipment sales are recognized at the point of sale 
pcs handset equipment sold with service contracts are generally sold at prices below cost  based on the terms of the service contracts 
the company recognizes the entire cost of the handsets at the time of sale 

table of contents the company evaluates related transactions to determine whether they should be viewed as multiple deliverable arrangements  which impact revenue recognition 
multiple deliverable arrangements are presumed to be bundled transactions and the total consideration is measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative selling price with certain limitations 
the company has determined that sales of handsets with service contracts related to these sales generated from company operated retail stores are multiple deliverable arrangements 
accordingly  substantially all of the nonrefundable activation fee revenues as well as the associated direct costs are allocated to the wireless handset and are recognized at the time of the sale based on the fact that the handsets are generally sold well below cost and thus appropriately allocated to the point of sale based on the relative selling price evaluation 
however  revenue and certain associated direct costs for activations sold at third party retail locations are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship as the company is not a principal in the transaction to sell the handset and therefore any activation fees charged are fully attributable to the service revenues 
the company recognizes revenue in the period that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred or services have been rendered  it is able to determine the amount and when the collection of such amount is considered probable 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for which we evaluate and estimate the collectability  based on a combination of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  historical results  current and expected trends and changes in credit policies 
management believes the allowance adequately covers all anticipated losses with respect to trade receivables 
actual credit losses could differ from such estimates  which may result in higher costs and expenses in future periods if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low  or decreased costs and expenses in future periods if it is too high 
inventories and supplies the company s inventories and supplies consist primarily of items held for resale such as pcs handsets and accessories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
market value is determined by reviewing current replacement cost  marketability and obsolescence 
management regularly performs detailed assessments of inventory  which include a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  product pricing  shelf life and quality issues 
we record adjustments to inventory for excess quantities  obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
costs and expenses could vary in future periods if our inventory reserves are not adequate 
long lived asset recovery long lived assets comprise property  plant and equipment  intangible assets including goodwill  radio spectrum licenses  customer relationships and trademarks and long term deferred charges 
long lived assets  excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  are recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be evaluated pursuant to the subsequent measurement guidance described in fasb asc  property  plant and equipment 
impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the excess of the asset s carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment charge 
the company believes that no impairment exists as of december  depreciation of property  plant and equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which the company reviews and updates based on historical experiences and future expectations 
buildings are depreciated over a year life and leasehold improvements  which are categorized in land and buildings  are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the remaining lease terms 
network plant and equipment  which includes cell towers and site costs  and switch  cell site and other network equipment  are depreciated over various lives ranging from to years  with a weighted average life of approximately years 
furniture  fixtures and other equipment are depreciated over various lives ranging from to years 
the company formally evaluates the appropriateness of estimated useful lives on at least an annual basis 
consideration is given to the trends in technological evolution and the telecommunications industry  the company s maintenance practices and the functional condition of long lived assets in relation to the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
when necessary  adjustments are made to the applicable useful life of an asset class or depreciation is accelerated for assets that have been identified for retirement prior to the expiration of the original useful life 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and radio spectrum licenses are considered indefinite lived intangible assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are instead tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired 
the company assesses the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets annually on october and whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 

table of contents the company uses a two step process to test for goodwill impairment 
step one requires a determination of the fair value of each of the reporting units and  to the extent that this fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value including goodwill  the step two calculation of implied fair value of goodwill is not required and no impairment loss is recognized 
in testing for goodwill impairment  the company utilizes a combination of a discounted cash flow model and an analysis which allocates enterprise value to the reporting units 
the company s annual testing is performed as of october of each year 
the radio spectrum licenses relate primarily to pcs licenses in service in the markets that we serve 
the company considers a number of valuation methods  including market based and the greenfield cash flow method  in its impairment testing for these assets 
the company s annual testing is performed as of october of each year 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
the company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and income tax expense  respectively 
further information regarding income taxes  including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity  is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

irc sections and and sections and of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended establish minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans 
the minimum required contribution is generally equal to the target normal cost plus the shortfall amortization installments for the current plan year and each of the six preceding plan years less any calculated credit balance 
if plan assets less calculated credits are equal to or exceed the funding target  the minimum required contribution is the target normal cost reduced by the excess funding  but not below zero 
the company s policy is to make contributions to stay at or above the threshold required in order to prevent benefit restrictions and related additional notice requirements and is intended to provide not only for benefits based on service to date  but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
also  ntelos inc has nonqualified pension plans that are accounted for similar to its pension plan 
ntelos inc provides certain health care and life benefits for retired employees that meet eligibility requirements 
the company has two qualified nonpension postretirement benefit plans 
the health care plan is contributory  with participants contributions adjusted annually 
the life insurance plan also is contributory 
these obligations  along with all of the pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  are ntelos inc obligations assumed by the company 
eligibility for the life insurance plan is restricted to active pension participants age as of january  neither plan is eligible to employees hired after april the accounting for the plans anticipates that the company will maintain a consistent level of cost sharing for the benefits with the retirees 
the company s share of the projected costs of benefits that will be paid after retirement is generally being accrued by charges to expense over the eligible employees service periods to the dates they are fully eligible for benefits 
ntelos inc also sponsors a contributory defined contribution plan under irc section k for substantially all employees

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we are exposed to certain market risks including the impact of interest rate changes 
aggregate maturities of long term debt outstanding under the amended and restated credit agreement  based on the contractual terms of the instruments  were million as of december  under this facility  the term loan a bears interest at a rate equal to either above the eurodollar rate as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement or above the base rate as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement  and the term loan b bears interest at a rate equal to either above the eurodollar rate as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement or above the base rate as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement 
the amended and restated credit agreement provides that the eurodollar rate shall never be less than per annum and the base rate shall never be less than per annum 
we also have other fixed rate  long term debt in the form of capital leases totaling million as of december  in the first quarter of  we purchased an interest rate cap for million with a notional amount of million 
the interest rate cap reduces our exposure to changes in the three month eurodollar rate by capping the rate at

libor for purposes of this facility floats when it exceeds the floor of 
at december   an immediate increase or decrease to libor would not currently have an effect on our interest expense as the variable libor component would remain below the floor 
in addition  at december  we had approximately million of cash held in a market rate savings account 
an immediate increase or decrease to the market interest rate would not have a material effect on our cash flows
