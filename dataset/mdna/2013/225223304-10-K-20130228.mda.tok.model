item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements as described in the section forward looking statements preceding part i of this annual report on form k  and is subject to the safe harbor created by section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in item a 
risk factors in part i and other sections of this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview and executive summary we design  develop  manufacture  market and service high performance computing  or hpc  systems  including categories of systems commonly known as supercomputers and or clusters  and provide storage solutions  software and engineering services related to hpc systems to our customers  which include government agencies and government funded entities  academic institutions and commercial entities 
we provide customer focused solutions based on two models 
firstly  we provide highly integrated supercomputing  storage and data analytics solutions  complete with highly tuned software  that stress capability  scalability  sustained performance and reliability at scale 
secondly  we provide flexible commodity based cluster supercomputing and storage solutions based upon choosing best of breed components and working with our customers to define solutions that meet specific needs 
all of our solutions also emphasize total cost of ownership  energy efficiency and data center flexibility as key features 
our current strategy is to gain market share in the high end supercomputer market segment  extend our technology leadership  maintain our focus on execution and profitability and grow by expanding our addressable market in areas where we can leverage our experience and technology  such as in storage of and analytics on enormous volumes of data  popularly referred to as big data  technical enterprise class systems and custom engineered solutions 
summary of results revenue increased by million in compared to to million 
product revenue increased by million and service revenue decreased by million 
the increase in product revenue was principally the result of two significant system acceptances  one at the national center for supercomputing applications ncsa at the university of illinois and another for the first phase of the upgrade at the oak ridge national laboratory 
service revenue decreased in part due to lower revenue from our former special purpose systems practice and the effect of an additional million in revenue recorded on a custom engineering contract in  as revenue was recognized on the cash basis as our ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured 
cray cluster solutions contributed  in revenue in product gross profit margin for of was consistent with gross profit margin from services was lower in compared to due to the additional revenue from the custom engineering contract referred to above and the associated costs having been recorded in prior periods  as well as million in higher incentive compensation expense in we recorded income from operations of million in compared to income from operations of million in the increase in net income from operations was primarily attributable to both a million gain on the sale of our interconnect hardware development program to intel and an increase in gross profit of million in over due to higher product revenue 
this was partially offset by lower service revenue and lower gross profit on service revenue 
operating expenses increased million principally due to additional investments in research and development activities  lower research and development reimbursements and an additional million in incentive based compensation and commissions 
incentive compensation costs are principally driven by pre bonus operating income and  to a lesser extent  product revenue 
net income increased from million in to million in due to the increase in operating income discussed above  partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of million 
net cash provided by operations during was million  as compared to net cash used in operations of million in the increase in net cash provided by operations was principally due to higher net income and higher collections from customers 

table of contents market overview and challenges significant trends in the hpc industry include supercomputing with many core commodity processors driving increasing scalability requirements  increased micro architectural diversity  including increased usage of many core processors and growing accelerators  as the rate of per core performance increases slows  data needs growing faster than computational needs  the commoditization of hpc hardware  particularly processors and interconnect systems  electrical power requirements becoming a design constraint and driver in total cost of ownership determinations  the growing commoditization of software  including plentiful building blocks and more capable open source software  and cloud computing for cost effective computing on loosely coupled hpc applications 
several of these trends have resulted in the expansion and acceptance of loosely coupled cluster systems using processors manufactured by intel  amd and others combined with commercially available  low cost  commodity networking and other components  particularly in the middle and lower segments of the hpc market 
these systems may offer higher theoretical peak performance for equivalent cost  and price peak performance is often the dominant factor in hpc procurements outside of the high end supercomputer market segment 
vendors of such systems often put pricing pressure on us in competitive procurements 
in the markets for the largest  and most scalable systems  those often costing significantly in excess of million  the use of commodity components can result in increasing data transfer bottlenecks as these components do not balance processor power with network communication capability 
with the arrival of increasing processor core counts due to new many core processors  these unbalanced systems will typically have even lower productivity  especially in larger systems running more complex applications 
we and other vendors have also begun to augment standard microprocessors with other processor types  such as graphics processing units and field programmable gate arrays  in order to increase computational power  further complicating programming models 
in addition  with increasing scale  bandwidth and processor core counts  large computer systems use progressively higher amounts of power to operate and require special cooling capabilities 
to position ourselves to meet the market s demanding needs  we concentrate our research and development efforts on technologies that enable our supercomputers to perform at scale that is  to continue to increase actual performance as systems grow ever larger in size and in areas where we can leverage our core expertize in other markets whose applications demand these tightly coupled architectures 
we also have demonstrated expertise in several processor technologies 
we expect to be in a comparatively advantageous position as larger many core processors become available and as multiple processing technologies become integrated into single systems in heterogeneous environments 
in addition  we have begun to expand our addressable market by leveraging our technologies and customer base  the cray brand and industry trends by introducing complementary products and services to new and existing customers  as demonstrated by our emphasis on strategic initiatives  such as storage and data management and big data analytics 
we have also recently significantly expanded our addressable market with the acquisition of appro 
appro provides cluster systems and solutions to the hpc market 
appro had the third highest number of systems in the top of the november top supercomputer sites ranking 
appro became cray cluster solutions  or ccs  following the acquisition 

table of contents key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
product revenue generally constitutes the major portion of our revenue in any reporting period and  for the reasons discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  is subject to significant variability from period to period 
in the short term  we closely review the status of product shipments  installations and acceptances in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts  longer term  we monitor the status of the pipeline of product sales opportunities and product development cycles 
product revenue growth over several quarters is an indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of increased market share in the supercomputing market 
the introduction of the cray xc and the addition of ccs products  along with longer term product roadmap are efforts to increase product revenue 
we are also increasing our business and product development efforts in storage and data management  big data analytics  technical enterprise hpc systems and custom engineered solutions 
maintenance service revenue is more constant in the short term and assists  in part  to offset the impact that the variability in product revenue has on total revenue 
gross profit margin 
our product gross profit margin was in and the new cluster systems products typically have lower gross margins than our other products  which is somewhat offset by lower operating costs 
service gross profit margin decreased from in to in the decrease in service gross profit margin is due to higher incentive compensation expense and an additional million in revenue recorded on a custom engineering contract in where revenue was recognized on the cash basis  and the associated costs were recorded in prior periods  as our ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured 
the decrease in our service gross margin drove the decrease in our total gross profit margin from in to in operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven largely by headcount  the level of recognized co funding for research and development  contracted third party research and development services  and incentive compensation expense 
as part of our ongoing efforts to control operating expenses  we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in product revenue  new contracts  and payment terms  our cash position also varies significantly from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
we monitor our expected cash levels  particularly in light of increased inventory purchases for large system installations and the risk of delays in product shipments and acceptances and  longer term  in product development 
the net proceeds from the sale of our interconnect hardware development program to intel of million in substantially increased our liquidity position 

table of contents results of operations revenue and gross profit our product and service revenue for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  product revenue less cost of product revenue product gross profit product gross profit percentage service revenue less cost of service revenue service gross profit service gross profit percentage total revenue less total cost of revenue total gross profit total gross profit percentage product revenue product revenue in increased million  or  over principally as the result of two significant system acceptances  one at ncsa at the university of illinois blue waters and another for the first phase of the upgrade at the oak ridge national laboratory 
additionally  revenue from our storage and data management business unit increased from million in to million in a large portion of storage and data management revenues in were attributable to the blue waters system at the university of illinois 
product revenue in decreased million  or  over principally due to our inability to complete the acceptance process of the first phase of the upgrade at the oak ridge national laboratory in  which resulted in a delay in the recognition of the associated revenue until additionally  revenue from sales of our external storage systems was lower in as fewer customers implemented large storage systems during the year 
service revenue service revenue for decreased million from service revenue decreased in part due to an additional million in revenue recorded on a custom engineering contract in  as revenue was recognized on the cash basis as our ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured in service revenue for increased million from lower revenues on certain custom engineering projects were offset by a million increase in revenue from our maintenance and support group due to an increased number of systems in the field 
custom engineering service revenue in included an additional million in revenue recorded on a contract where revenue was recognized on the cash basis as our ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured 
cost of product revenue and product gross profit cost of product revenue for increased by million compared to driven by significantly higher product revenue 
product gross profit percentage was in and product gross profit percentage was unchanged at in and lower component costs  principally memory  contributed to maintaining product gross margin levels in this was partially offset by penalties incurred on product acceptances resulting from delays in the availability of a key component 
cost of service revenue and service gross profit cost of service revenue decreased million and service gross profit margin decreased by six percentage points to in compared to gross profit margin from services was lower in compared to due to an additional million in revenue in recorded on a custom engineering contract where revenue was being recorded on a cash basis  and the associated costs were recorded in prior periods  as the company s ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured  as well as million in higher incentive compensation in 
table of contents cost of service revenue decreased million and service gross profit margin increased by percentage points to in compared to the increase in service gross profit margin was due to increases in revenue from our maintenance and support group from the large systems that were accepted in the fourth quarter of with a minimal increase in costs and an additional million in revenue in recorded on a custom engineering contract where revenue was being recorded on a cash basis  where the associated costs were recorded in prior periods  as the company ability to collect payment was not reasonably assured 
the company workforce reductions in march and other cost reduction actions also contributed to an increase in service gross profit for operating expenses research and development research and development expenses for the indicated years ended december were as follows in thousands  except for percentages gross research and development expenses less amounts included in cost of revenue less reimbursed research and development excludes amounts in revenue net research and development expenses percentage of total revenue gross research and development expenses in the table above reflect all research and development expenditures 
research and development expenses include personnel expenses  depreciation  allocations for certain overhead expenses  software  prototype materials and outside contracted expenses 
in  the company phase iii agreement with darpa was amended to eliminate certain deliverables and reduce the co funding amount to million 
as of december   the darpa phase iii agreement was substantially complete and we have received all million in reimbursement 
in  gross research and development expenses increased million from levels primarily due to increased investments in the development of new products for our new initiatives as well as million in additional incentive based compensation expense 
reimbursed research and development decreased million in compared to primarily due to million less in reimbursements recognized in connection with our darpa hpcs phase iii project 
in  gross research and development expenses decreased million from levels primarily due to decreased incentive based compensation expense and lower third party service expenses  partially offset by higher salary expense resulting from higher headcount 
reimbursed research and development decreased million in compared to due to million less in reimbursements recognized in connection with our darpa hpcs phase iii project as we passed two milestones in compared to three milestones in other operating expenses our sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses for the indicated years ended december were in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  sales and marketing percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue restructuring percentage of total revenue sales and marketing 
the million increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was due to higher headcount and million in additional incentive based compensation and commissions 
the million decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was due principally to lower incentive based compensation and lower commissions 

table of contents general and administrative 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was partly due to million higher incentive based compensation and million of costs incurred for the appro acquisition 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to lower incentive based compensation and lower salary expense due to lower headcount 
restructuring 
restructuring expenses in were primarily due to the elimination of positions in our workforce rebalancing 
sale of interconnect hardware development program on may   we sold our interconnect hardware development program to intel for cash consideration of million 
as part of the transaction  of our employees joined intel  and certain intellectual property and fixed assets were transferred to intel 
we retained certain rights to use the transferred assets and intellectual property 
as a result of the sale  we recorded a gain of million for the year ended december  other income expense  net we recorded million in net other income and million and million of net other expense for the years ended december   and  respectively  principally due to foreign exchange transaction gains and losses 
interest income expense  net our interest income and interest expense for the years ended december were in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense net interest income expense interest income in increased as compared to due to higher average invested balances 
interest income in decreased as compared to due to lower average invested balances and lower short term interest rates 
interest expense decreased modestly in as a result of changes in our credit arrangements 
interest expense in was consistent with taxes we recorded income tax benefit expense for the years ended december as follows in thousands year ended december  net income before income taxes tax benefit expense net income effective tax rate the primary reason for the difference between the income tax provision at the federal statutory rate of and our effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  is that the gain from the sale of our interconnect hardware development program did not result in significant income tax expense 
we had existing deferred tax assets that were subject to valuation allowances and deductible temporary differences that were previously unrecognized 
the sale of the interconnect hardware development program was never anticipated in previous evaluations of the realizability of our deferred tax assets and consequently the sale  together with a tax benefit that was recognized as a result of restructuring a subsidiary  resulted in our ability to experience a relatively small tax consequence from the sale 
the tax benefit recorded by us during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a partial reduction  in the amount of million  of the valuation allowance held against our us deferred tax assets and the complete reduction  in the amount of million  of the valuation allowance held against the deferred tax assets of the company german subsidiary 
income tax expense recorded in related primarily to income taxes payable 
during the year ended december   we reduced the valuation allowance held against our deferred tax assets by million as a result of the sale of the company interconnect hardware development program 
the company further reduced the valuation allowance held against its us deferred tax assets by million during the year ended december  due to actual income from operations during the year ended december  exceeding amounts previously used in the evaluation of the realizability of the company deferred tax assets at the beginning of the year and based upon an assessment of all positive 
table of contents and negative evidence relating to future years  including changes resulting from the company acquisition of appro 
we consider our actual historical results over several years to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the assessment of our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets included an assessment of all known business risks and industry trends as well as forecasted domestic and international earnings over a number of years 
our ability to forecast results significantly into the future is severely limited due to the rapid rate of technological and competitive change in the industry in which we operate 
our conclusion about the realizability of our deferred tax assets  and therefore the appropriateness of the valuation allowance  is reviewed quarterly and could change in future periods depending on our future assessment of all available evidence in support of the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will expire between through  if not utilized 
liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations predominantly from the sale of high performance computer systems and related services 
we typically have a small number of significant contracts that make up the majority of total revenue 
the material changes in certain of our balance sheet accounts were due to the timing of product deliveries  customer acceptances  contractually determined billings and cash collections 
working capital requirements  including inventory purchases and normal capital expenditures  are generally funded with cash from operations 
cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by million from december  to december  the increase is attributable to the million received from the sale of our interconnect hardware development program to intel and large collections from systems such as the ncsa blue waters system and the first phase of the upgrade at oak ridge national laboratory 
partially offsetting these items were the net cash used in the appro acquisition of million and the purchases of debt instruments of others of million 
no debt securities were held at december  accrued payroll and related expenses increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to higher accruals for incentive compensation expense 
the current portion of deferred revenues increased to million as of december  from million at december   resulting principally from advance payments billed to customers prior to acceptance of the associated system 
cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled million at december  compared to million at december  as of december   we had working capital of million compared to million as of december  cash flow information for the years ended december included the following in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million and net cash used in operating activities in was million 
net cash used by operating activities was million in for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of significant decreases in accounts receivable and increases in deferred revenue 
for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was principally the result of a significant increase in inventory partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
for the year ended december   cash used by operating activities was principally the result of a large increase in accounts receivable due to final billings related to fourth quarter acceptances due in early investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities was million in net cash provided by investing activities was million in for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was due principally to the sale of our interconnect hardware development program to intel for million  net of direct transaction costs  partially offset by purchases of investments of million and the acquisition of appro of million  net of cash assumed 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was principally the result of purchases of property and equipment 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was a result of the sale of million in short term investments and a million decrease in restricted cash  offset by property and equipment purchases of million 

table of contents financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises as a consequence of a significant increase in our average stock price and stock purchases from our employee stock purchase plan 
over the next twelve months  we expect our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory associated with certain large scale product deliveries  spare parts  outside engineering expenses  and the acquisition of property and equipment 
in addition  we lease certain equipment and facilities used in our operations under operating leases in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands amounts committed by year contractual obligations total year years years thereafter development agreements operating leases total contractual cash obligations as of december   we had a million unsecured line of credit with wells fargo bank  national association 
this facility has a maturity date of october  as of december   we had a million letter of credit facility with silicon valley bank 
the silicon valley bank facility is unsecured and may be used only to support the issuance of letters of credit 
this facility has a maturity date of october  we have made no draws and had no outstanding borrowings on any lines of credit as of december  in our normal course of operations  we have development arrangements under which we engage outside engineering resources to work on our research and development projects 
for the year ended december   we incurred million for such arrangements 
at any particular time  our cash position is affected by the timing of cash receipts for product sales  maintenance contracts  government co funding for research and development activities and our payments for inventory  resulting in significant fluctuations in our cash balance from quarter to quarter and within a quarter 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash from operations 
we expect our cash resources to be adequate for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of our cash resources is dependent on the amount and timing of government funding as well as our ability to sell our products with adequate gross profit 
beyond the next twelve months  the adequacy of our cash resources will largely depend on our success in achieving profitable operations and positive operating cash flows on a sustained basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with gaap  there are certain accounting policies that are particularly important 
these include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  income taxes  research and development expenses and share based compensation 
we believe these accounting policies and others set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item exhibits and financial statement schedules in part iv of this annual report should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
in some cases  these policies represent required accounting 
in other cases  they may represent a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation 
additionally  we consider certain judgments and estimates to be significant  including those relating to the estimated selling price determination used in revenue recognition  percentage of completion accounting  estimates of proportional performance on co funded engineering contracts and prepaid engineering services  determination of inventory at the lower of cost or market  useful lives for depreciation and amortization  determination of future cash flows associated with impairment testing of long lived assets  determination of the fair value of stock options and other assessments of fair value  calculation of deferred income tax assets  including our ability to utilize such assets  potential income tax assessments and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
our management has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped or services provided to the customer  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  and  where applicable  a customer acceptance has been obtained 
the sales price is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all material contingencies related to the sales have been resolved 
we record revenue in the consolidated statements of operations net of any sales  use  value added or certain excise taxes imposed by governmental authorities on specific sales transactions 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are our statements of policy with regard to multiple element arrangements and specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue 
multiple element arrangements 
we commonly enter into revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables of our product and service offerings due to the needs of our customers 
product may be delivered in phases over time periods which can be as long as five years 
maintenance services generally begin upon acceptance of the first equipment delivery and future deliveries of equipment generally have an associated maintenance period 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product or installation in situations where a formal acceptance is not required  which may include a warranty period and accordingly allocate a portion of the arrangement consideration as a separate deliverable which is recognized as service revenue over the entire service period 
other services such as training and engineering services can be delivered as a discrete delivery or over the term of the contract 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are not met  the arrangement is accounted for as one unit of accounting which would result in revenue being recognized ratably over the contract term or being deferred until the earlier of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered element is delivered 
if these criteria are met for each element  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative estimated selling price 
we follow a selling price hierarchy in determining the best estimate of the selling price of each deliverable 
certain products and services are sold separately in standalone arrangements for which we are sometimes able to determine vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
we determine vsoe based on normal pricing and discounting practices for the product or service when sold separately 
when we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements  we attempt to establish the selling price of each remaining element based on third party evidence  or tpe 
our inability to establish vsoe is often due to a relatively small sample of customer contracts that differ in system size and contract terms which can be due to infrequently selling each element separately  not pricing products within a narrow range  or only having a limited sales history  such as in the case of certain advanced and emerging technologies 
tpe is determined based on our prices or competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
however  we are often unable to determine tpe  as our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation from those of competitors and we are often unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a standalone basis 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use estimated selling price  or esp  in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 
in determining esp  we use either the list price of the deliverable less a discount or the cost to provide the product or service plus a margin 
when using list price less a discount  we use discounts from list price for previous transactions 
this approach incorporates several factors  including the size of the transaction and any changes to list prices 
the data is collected from prior sales  and although the data may not have the sample size or consistency to establish vsoe  it is sufficiently objective to estimate the selling price 
when using cost plus a margin  we consider the total cost of the product or service  including customer specific and geographic factors 
we also consider the historical margins of the product or service on previous contracts and several factors including any changes to pricing methodologies  competitiveness of products and services and cost drivers that would cause future margins to differ from historical margins 
products 
we most often recognize revenue from sales of products upon customer acceptance of the system 
where formal acceptance is not required  we recognize revenue upon delivery or installation 
when the product is part of a multiple element arrangement  we allocate a portion of the arrangement consideration to product revenue based on estimates of selling price 
services 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods  often with prepayments for the 
table of contents term of the contract 
we consider the maintenance period to commence upon acceptance of the product or installation in situations where a formal acceptance is not required  which may include a warranty period 
when service is part of a multiple element arrangement  we allocate a portion of the arrangement consideration to maintenance service revenue based on estimates of selling price 
maintenance contracts that are billed in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
revenue from engineering services is recognized as services are performed 
project revenue 
revenue from design and build contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion  or poc method 
under the poc method  revenue is recognized based on the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs to fulfill the contract 
if circumstances arise that change the original estimates of revenues  costs  or extent of progress toward completion  revisions to the estimates are made 
these revisions may result in increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs  and such revisions are recorded in income in the period in which the circumstances that gave rise to the revision become known by management 
we perform ongoing profitability analyses of our contracts accounted for under the poc method in order to determine whether the latest estimates of revenue  costs and extent of progress require updating 
if at any time these estimates indicate that the contract will be unprofitable  the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately 
we record revenue from certain research and development contracts which include milestones using the milestone method if the milestones are determined to be substantive 
a milestone is considered to be substantive if management believes there is substantive uncertainty that it will be achieved and the milestone consideration meets all of the following criteria it is commensurate with either of the following our performance to achieve the milestone  or the enhancement of value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone 
it relates solely to past performance 
it is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms including other potential milestone consideration within the arrangement 
the individual milestones are determined to be substantive or nonsubstantive in their entirety and milestone consideration is not bifurcated 
revenue from projects is classified as product revenue or service revenue  based on the nature of the work performed 
nonmonetary transactions 
we value and record nonmonetary transactions at the fair value of the asset surrendered unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident  in which case the fair value of the asset received is used 
inventory valuation we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness and anticipated future demand for our inventory components 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
additionally  during periods of product or inventory component upgrades or transitions  we may acquire significant quantities of inventory to support estimated current and future production and service requirements 
as a result  it is possible that older inventory items we have purchased may become obsolete  be sold below cost or be deemed in excess of quantities required for production or service requirements 
when we determine it is not likely we will recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we also may have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
table of contents through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence  which includes  among other things  our recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results over several years to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators  including forecasts  when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
we have significant difficulty projecting future results due to the nature of the business and the industry in which we operate 
we recognize the income tax benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the applicable taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of our position 
the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
estimated interest and penalties are recorded as a component of interest expense and other expense  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  against which we provided a million valuation allowance  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
during the year ended december  the company reduced the valuation allowance held against our deferred tax assets by million as a result of the sale of the company interconnect hardware development program 
the company further reduced the valuation allowance held against its us deferred tax assets by million during the year ended december  due to actual income from operations during the year ended december  exceeding amounts previously used in the evaluation of the realizability of the company deferred tax assets at the beginning of the year and based upon an assessment of all positive and negative evidence relating to future years  including changes resulting from the company acquisition of appro 
the company considers its actual historical results over several years to have stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the assessment of our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets included an assessment of all known business risks and industry trends as well as forecasted domestic and international earnings over a number of years 
our ability to forecast results significantly into the future is severely limited due to the rapid rate of technological and competitive change in the industry in which we operate 
we continue to provide a partial valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets and a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising in a limited number of foreign jurisdictions as the realization of such assets is not considered to be more likely than not at this time 
in a future period our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets and therefore the appropriateness of the valuation allowance could change based on an assessment of all available evidence  both positive and negative in that future period 
if our conclusion about the realizability of our deferred tax assets and therefore the appropriateness of the valuation allowance changes in a future period we could record a substantial tax provision or benefit in our consolidated statement of operations when that occurs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs incurred in the development and production of our hardware and software  costs incurred to enhance and support existing product features  costs incurred to support and improve our development processes  and costs related to future product development 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  and may be offset by co funding from third parties 
we may also enter into arrangements whereby we make advance  non refundable payments to a vendor to perform certain research and development services 
these payments are deferred and recognized over the vendor s estimated performance period 
amounts to be received under co funding arrangements with the us government or other customers are based on either contractual milestones or costs incurred 
these co funding milestone payments are recognized in operations as performance is estimated to be completed and are measured as milestone achievements occur or as costs are incurred 
these estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and are subject to change  including in the near term 
if an estimate is changed  net research and development expense could be impacted significantly 
we do not record a receivable from the us government prior to completing the requirements necessary to bill for a milestone or cost reimbursement 
funding from the us government is subject to certain budget restrictions and milestones may be subject to completion risk  and as a result  there may be periods in which research and development costs are expensed as incurred for which no reimbursement is recorded  as milestones have not been completed or the us government has not funded an agreement 
accordingly  there can be substantial variability in the amount of net research and development expenses from quarter to quarter and year to year 
we classify amounts to be received from funded research and development projects as either revenue or a reduction to research and development expense based on the specific facts and circumstances of the contractual arrangement  considering total costs expected to be incurred compared to total expected funding and the nature of the research and development contractual arrangement 
in the event that a particular arrangement is determined to represent revenue  the corresponding research and development costs are classified as cost of revenue 

table of contents share based compensation we measure compensation cost for share based payment awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we recognize share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we utilize the black scholes options pricing model to value the stock options granted under our options plans 
in this model  we utilize assumptions related to stock price volatility  stock option term and forfeiture rates that are based upon both historical factors as well as management s judgment 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued asu no 
 comprehensive income  or asu the guidance in asu revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
an entity is required to report the components of comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements a single  continuous statement must present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income  and a total for comprehensive income 
in a two statement approach  an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement 
that statement must be immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income  a total for other comprehensive income  and a total for comprehensive income 
asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
we adopted this standard in and have elected to present separate consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we invest our available cash in money market mutual funds whose underlying investments include investment grade debt instruments of corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies 
we do not have any derivative instruments or auction rate securities in our investment portfolio 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
although we have the above noted risks  a change in interest rates would not be material 
foreign currency risk we sell our products primarily in north america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced based on us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we often sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts may call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  or engage with our foreign subsidiaries in transactions deemed to be short term in nature  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
as of december   we had entered into forward exchange contracts that hedge approximately million of anticipated cash receipts on specific foreign currency denominated sales contracts 
these forward contracts hedge the risk of foreign exchange rate changes between the time that the related contracts were signed and when the cash receipts are expected to be received 
our foreign maintenance contracts are typically paid in local currencies and provide a partial natural hedge against foreign exchange exposure 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
as of december   a change in foreign exchange rates could impact our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
we do not hold or purchase any currency forward exchange contracts for trading purposes
