financial overview for the year ended december   our revenue increased by million  or  to  million  compared to  million for the year ended december  included in this 
table of contents change in revenue are a decrease of approximately million from the impact of foreign exchange due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro and other foreign currencies and an increase of approximately million attributable to recent acquisitions 
excluding the effects of foreign exchange and our recent acquisitions  revenue increased by million  or 
the increase in revenue on an adjusted basis is attributable to both the scientific instruments segment  which increased by million  or  and the energy supercon technologies segment  which increased by million  or revenue in the scientific instruments segment reflects an increase in sales from many of our core technologies  particularly nuclear magnetic resonance  mass spectrometry and x ray products 
the mix of products sold in the scientific instruments segment during reflects increased demand from academic  government and industrial customers 
we attribute the increase in sales to academic and government customers to increased spending from these customers and to new product introductions 
the improvement in revenues from our industrial customers reflects continued growth in these end markets and our new product introductions 
revenues in the energy supercon technologies segment increased primarily due to recognition of license revenue on the sale of technology 
in addition  revenue benefitted from higher demand for low temperature superconducting wire 
though we recognized increased revenue in on a year over year basis  we began to see a softening in demand  particularly in europe 
we also noted a weakening in global industrial and applied markets  as well as in the semiconductor and data storage metrology markets 
we are uncertain whether the recent market conditions will continue or how our revenue derived from those market segments may be affected 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  our gross profit margin for the year ended december  was  compared with for the year ended december  excluding the effects of inventory and fixed asset charges  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and restructuring charges totaling  in the aggregate  million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  gross profit margins increased to for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit margins for the year ended december  was driven by license revenue from the sale of technology in the energy supercon technologies segment  which had minimal associated cost  and sales of our newly introduced products  which carry higher gross margins than our previous generations of products 
offsetting these items were increasing pricing pressures in certain markets  changes in the mix of products and lower gross profit margins in our cam division due to increased production costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in is attributable to increases in headcount to support planned revenue growth in our existing businesses and from our recent acquisitions 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies  partially offset the increase because the majority of our employees are located in europe 
we are focused on controlling costs and are implementing selective cost saving programs with the goal of reducing operating expenses and improving operating margins in we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million for the year ended december   comprising goodwill and definite lived intangible assets of million and million  respectively  related to our cam division  and an impairment charge of million for other long lived assets to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair value 
income from operations for the year ended december  was million  resulting in an operating margin of  compared to income from operations of million  resulting in an 
table of contents operating margin of  for the year ended december  the decrease in operating margin was largely due to the impairment of assets noted above  partially offset by the recognition of license revenue on the sale of technology in the energy supercon technologies segment 
included in income from operations are various charges for inventory write downs  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and other acquisition related costs  impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long term assets  deferred offering costs that have been expensed  legal and other professional services fees related to our internal investigation and review of our operations in china  and restructuring and relocation costs totaling  in the aggregate  million and million in and  respectively 
excluding these charges  operating margins were in and in the increase in adjusted operating margins for the year ended december  compared to the prior year is due to the revenue growth noted above  in particular the recognition of the license revenue in the energy supercon technologies segment  offset by pricing pressures experienced in certain markets  changes in the mix of products sold and higher operating expenses 
our effective tax rate for was  compared to for the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impairment charges noted above  which are unbenefitted in certain jurisdictions 
our net income attributable to the shareholders of bruker corporation for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  was due to increases in operating expenses  including impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets  higher spending on non recurring items and higher net interest expense 
these were partially offset by revenue growth and higher gross margins 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  the expensing and capitalization of software development costs  stock based compensation expense  restructuring and other related charges  income taxes  including the recoverability of deferred tax assets  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  estimated fair values of long lived assets used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  expected future cash flows used to evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and long lived assets  warranty costs  derivative financial instruments and contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  industry trends and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss is generally transferred upon customer acceptance for a system that has been delivered to the customer 

table of contents when products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner who assumes responsibility for installation  we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor 
our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return  however  our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year 
revenue is deferred until cash is received when collectability is not reasonably assured or when the price is not fixed or determinable 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on their relative selling prices 
the relative selling price of each element is based on our vendor specific objective evidence  if available 
if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  we use evidence from third parties or  when third party evidence is not available  we use management best estimate of the selling price 
typically  we cannot ascertain third party evidence of selling price 
when products and services offered do not qualify as separate units of accounting  we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance for a system that has been shipped  installed  and for which the customer has been trained 
as a result  the timing of customer acceptance or readiness could cause reported revenues to differ materially from expectations 
revenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
we also have contracts for which we apply the percentage of completion model and completed contract model of revenue recognition 
application of these methods requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract and the total costs we will incur under the contract 
changes in our estimates could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
income taxes 
the determination of income tax expense requires us to make certain estimates and judgments concerning the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the deductions  carryforwards and credits that are available to reduce taxable income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial statement and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to be settled 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and we provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a reserve has been provided  we reverse the related valuation allowance 
if our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates  additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary 
in addition  we only recognize benefits for tax positions that we believe are more likely than not of being sustained upon review by a taxing authority with knowledge of all relevant information 
we reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and any changes to these positions as a result of tax audits  tax laws or other facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to operations 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with costs determined by the first in  first out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for certain other subsidiaries 
we record provisions to account for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected non saleable or non refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products 
inventories also include demonstration units located in our demonstration laboratories or installed at the sites of potential customers 
we consider our demonstration units to be available for sale 
we reduce the carrying value of demonstration inventories for differences between cost and estimated net realizable value  taking into consideration usage in the preceding twelve months  expected demand  technological obsolescence and other information including the physical condition of the unit 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional write downs may be required  resulting in additional charges to operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we evaluate whether goodwill is impaired annually and when events occur or circumstances change 
we test goodwill for impairment at 
table of contents the reporting unit level  which is the operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of both the market approach and the income approach methodologies 
the income approach valuation methodology includes discounted cash flow estimates 
estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant judgment by management about the future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment test  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
at december   the company performed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation and concluded all reporting units fair values exceeded their carrying values  with the exception of the cam division  which experienced increased deterioration in its financial performance 
the company  therefore  performed step two of the impairment test to measure potential impairment and concluded an impairment charge of million was required 
this amount represents all the goodwill allocated to the cam division and is recorded within impairment of assets in the accompanying statements of income and comprehensive income for the year ended december  there were no indefinite lived intangible assets associated with the cam division and no impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets during the year ended december  we also review definite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets when indications of potential impairment exist 
should the fair value of our long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of an impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
the company determined the increased deterioration in financial performance of the cam division discussed above was an indicator requiring the evaluation of the definite lived intangible assets within that reporting unit for recoverability 
the company performed a test based on projected future undiscounted cash flows at december  and determined that the definite lived intangible assets within the cam division were impaired 
the company recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million for the year ended december  to reduce the carrying value of those assets to their estimated fair values 
the impairment charge is included within impairment of assets in the accompanying statements of income and comprehensive income 
no impairment losses were recorded related to definite lived intangible assets during the years ended december  and the increased deterioration in financial performance of the cam division discussed above was also an indicator requiring the evaluation of other long lived assets within that reporting unit for recoverability 
in addition  based on the abandonment of a project in the energy supercon technologies reporting unit there was an indicator requiring the evaluation of those long lived assets for recoverability 
the company performed a test of projected future undiscounted cash flows at december   and determined that certain of the other long lived assets within the cam division and the energy supercon technologies reporting unit were impaired 
during the year ended december   an impairment charge in the amount of million related to property  plant and equipment was recorded to reduce the carrying value of those assets to their estimated fair values 
this amount is recorded within impairment of assets in the accompanying statements of income and comprehensive income 
we will continue to monitor goodwill and long lived intangible assets  as well as long lived tangible assets  for possible future impairment 
warranty costs 
we normally provide a one year parts and labor warranty with the purchase of equipment 
the anticipated cost for this warranty is accrued upon recognition of the sale based on historical warranty rates and our assumptions of future warranty claims 
the warranty accrual is 
table of contents included as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
although our products undergo quality assurance and testing procedures throughout the production process  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
although our actual warranty costs have historically been consistent with expectations  to the extent warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the warranty accrual may be required 
derivative financial instruments 
all derivative instruments are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value  which is calculated as an estimate of the future cash flows  and subsequent changes in a derivative fair value are recognized in income  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur 
we perform an assessment at the inception of the hedge  and on a quarterly basis thereafter  to determine whether our derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items 
any changes in the fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are immediately recognized as income or expense

we attribute the increase in sales to academic and government customers to increased spending from these customers and to new product introductions 
the improvement in revenues from our industrial customers reflects continued growth in these end markets and our new product introductions 
revenues in the energy supercon technologies segment increased primarily due to recognition of license revenue on the sale of technology 
in addition  revenue benefitted from higher demand for low temperature superconducting wire 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue for the year ended december   was million  resulting in a gross profit margin of  compared to cost of revenue of million  resulting in a gross profit margin of  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue is primarily a function of the higher revenues described above 
our cost of revenue for the year ended december  includes charges of million representing the difference between the fair value and the historical cost of inventories acquired in business combinations and sold during the period  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  and acquisition related fixed asset charges 
our cost of revenue for the year ended december  includes charges of million representing inventory allowances for the rework of certain specialty magnets that did not meet customer specifications  the difference between the fair value and the cost of inventories acquired in business combinations and sold during the period  and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets 
excluding these charges  our gross profit margin for the year ended december  and was and  respectively 
the higher gross profit margin was driven by license revenue from the sale of technology in the energy supercon technologies segment  which had minimal associated cost  and sales of our newly introduced products which carry higher gross margins than our previous generations of products 
offsetting these items were increasing pricing pressures in certain markets  changes in the mix of products and lower gross profit margins in our cam division due to increased production costs 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is driven by increases in headcount from our recent acquisitions and increases in headcount to support planned revenue growth in our existing businesses 
research and development our research and development expense for the year ended december  increased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is attributable to increases in headcount from recent acquisitions and increases in headcount and material costs to support future product introductions in our existing businesses 

table of contents impairment of assets the company recorded an impairment of assets of million for the year ended december   comprising goodwill and definite lived intangible asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  relating to our cam division  and an impairment charge of million of other long lived assets to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair value 
write off of deferred offering costs in september  we announced plans to sell a minority ownership position in our best subsidiary through an initial public offering of the capital stock of best 
as a result of economic and market factors  the timing of the best initial public offering was uncertain and deferred offering costs totaling million were expensed in the third quarter of in march  we determined not to proceed with the initial public offering of the capital stock of best 
other charges other charges  net of million recorded in consist of million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in china  million related to two factory relocations that are occurring within the energy supercon technologies segment  and million of other charges 
other charges  net of million recorded in consist of charges recorded entirely in the scientific instruments segment 
the charges recorded in consist of million of acquisition related costs associated with the nano surfaces business  chemical analysis business and other acquisitions completed during the year 
acquisition related costs consist of costs incurred under transition service arrangements we entered into with the sellers of the nano surfaces and chemical analysis businesses and transaction costs  including legal  accounting and other fees 
other charges  net for the year ended december  also includes million of legal and other professional service fees associated with our internal investigation and review of our operations in china and million of other charges 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net during the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the major components within interest and other income expense  net were net interest expense of million and foreign currency exchange losses of million  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of a product line during during the year ended december   the major components within interest and other income expense  net  consisted of net interest expense of million and foreign currency exchange losses of million 
the increase in interest expense is primarily a function of higher average outstanding debt balances throughout and an increase in the average interest rates we pay on outstanding borrowings due to entering into a longer term debt arrangement in with higher interest rates 
the losses on foreign currency exchange rates during were primarily a function of changes in exchange rates between the euro and the swiss franc against the us dollar 
provision for income taxes our income tax provision generally reflects amounts for non us entities only 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against all us deferred tax assets  including our us net operating losses and tax credits  until evidence exists that it is more likely than not that the loss carryforward and credit 
table of contents amounts will be utilized to offset us taxable income 
our tax rate may change over time as the amount and mix of income and taxes outside the us changes 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december   representing effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impairment charges  which are unbenefited in certain jurisdictions 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the minority shareholders proportionate share of the net income recorded by our majority owned indirect subsidiaries

 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
under this standard  entities will be required to disclose additional information with respect to changes in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci balances by component and significant items reclassified out of aoci 
expanded disclosures for presentation of changes in aoci involve disaggregating the total change of each component of other comprehensive income as well as presenting separately for each such component the portion of the change in aoci related to amounts reclassified into income and current period other comprehensive income 
additionally  for amounts reclassified into income  disclosure in one location would be required  based upon each specific aoci component  of the amounts impacting individual income statement line items 
disclosure of the income statement line item impacts will be required only for components of aoci reclassified into income in their entirety 
the disclosures required with respect to income statement line item impacts would be made in either the notes to the consolidated financial statements or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements

 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this update is intended to simplify the guidance for impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets as it provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the amended provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after september  however early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this amendment in will not have an impact on the company consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are potentially exposed to market risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce these risks 
all transactions related to risk management techniques are authorized and executed pursuant to our policies and procedures 
analytical techniques used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk include market valuations and sensitivity analysis 

table of contents impact of foreign currencies we generate a substantial portion of our revenues in international markets  principally germany and other countries in the european union  switzerland and japan  which exposes our operations to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate movement can be positive or negative in any period 
our costs related to sales in foreign currencies are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
in the years ended december  and our revenue by geography was as follows dollars in millions revenue percentage of revenue revenue percentage of revenue united states europe asia pacific rest of world total revenue changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our revenue by approximately in the year ended december  and increased revenue by in the year ended december  assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries  where the functional currency is the local currency  are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates  or historical rates  as appropriate 
revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year 
adjustments resulting from financial statement translations are included as a separate component of shareholders equity 
in the years ended december  and  we recorded net gains losses from currency translation adjustments of million and million  respectively 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reported in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
our foreign exchange losses  net were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
from time to time  we have entered into foreign currency contracts in order to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in exchange rates have on our cash flows related to purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies 
under these arrangements  we agree to purchase a fixed amount of a foreign currency in exchange for a fixed amount of us dollars or other currencies on specified dates  typically with maturities of less than twelve months 
these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting and  accordingly  the instrument is recorded at fair value with the corresponding gains and losses recorded in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 

table of contents at december  and  we had foreign currency contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had the following notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts in millions buy notional amount in buy currency sell maturity notional amount in us dollars fair value of assets fair value of liabilities december  euro australian dollars january to april euro us dollars january to october swiss francs us dollars january us dollars mexican pesos january based on the contractual maturities of these contracts and exchange rates as of december   we anticipate that these contracts will result in net cash flows of million in at december   assuming all other variables are constant  if the us dollar weakened by  the market value of our foreign currency contracts would increase by approximately million and if the us dollar strengthened by  the market value of our foreign currency contracts would decrease by approximately million 
we will continue to evaluate our currency risks and in the future may utilize foreign currency contracts more frequently as part of a transactional hedging program 
impact of interest rates we regularly invest excess cash in short term investments that are subject to changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal because of our policy of investing in short term financial instruments issued by highly rated financial institutions 
our exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is derived primarily from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market rates 
to manage the exposure that interest rate volatility might have on our earnings and cash flows  we have historically entered into interest rate swap arrangements 
at december   an interest rate swap in the amount of million matured 
we currently have a higher level of fixed rate debt  which limits our exposure to adverse movements in interest rates 
impact of commodity prices we are exposed to certain commodity risks associated with prices for various raw materials 
the prices of copper and certain other raw materials  particularly niobium  used to manufacture superconductors have increased significantly over the last decade 
copper and niobium tin are the main components of low temperature superconductors and continued commodity price increases for copper and niobium  as well as other raw materials  may negatively affect our profitability 
periodically  we enter into commodity forward purchase contracts to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in the price of copper have on our sales of these products 
at december  and december   we had fixed price commodity contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the fixed price commodity contracts at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
we will continue to evaluate our commodity risks and may utilize commodity forward purchase contracts more frequently in the future 
inflation we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our business or operating results during any of the periods presented
