manufacturing we do not have the facilities or capabilities to commercially manufacture any of our products and product candidates 
we have no current plans to establish a manufacturing facility 
we expect that we will be dependent to a significant extent on contract manufacturers for commercial scale manufacturing of our product candidates in accordance with regulatory standards 
contract manufacturers may utilize their own technology  technology developed by us  or technology acquired or licensed from third parties 
when contract manufacturers develop proprietary process technology  our reliance on such contract manufacturers is increased 
technology transfer from the original contract manufacturer may be required 
any such technology transfer may also require transfer of requisite data for regulatory purposes  including information contained in a proprietary drug master file dmf held by a contract manufacturer 
fda approval of the new manufacturer and manufacturing site would also be required 
we are responsible for us device manufacturing in compliance with current quality system regulations qsr established by the fda and by the centralized european regulatory authority medical device directive 
injector and disposable parts are manufactured by third party suppliers and are assembled by a third party supplier for our needle free device for all of our partners 
packaging is performed by a third party supplier under our direction 
product release is performed by us 
we have contracted with nypro inc nypro  an international manufacturing development company to supply commercial quantities of our vibex pressure assisted auto injector device in compliance with fda qsr regulations for our otrexup and vibex epinephrine products 
we have contracted with uman pharma montreal  canada to supply commercial quantities of methotrexate pre filled syringes for the u

sales and marketing otrexup we retain all us commercialization rights for otrexup  have begun to build an internal sales and marketing organization  and are entering into agreements with a contract sales organization and other vendors for commercialization services such as third party contracting and distribution 
we anticipate launching otrexup  provided it is approved by fda  with a field force comprised initially of approximately sales representatives  to market the product in the us to key rheumatology specialists 
we also plan to explore co promotion opportunities in the us with companies that have appropriate commercial capabilities to potentially extend our reach to dermatologists  assuming that otrexup is also approved for psoriasis  and other appropriate high potential prescribers 
we intend to enter into licensing or additional distribution arrangements for commercialization of our products outside the us  such as our relationship with uman pharma for the commercialization of otrexup in canada 
as part of our longer term strategy  we anticipate we will further develop our product candidates and selectively license or acquire additional products and or late stage product candidates that are synergistic with our commercial strategy

the agreement terms include an upfront payment  development and sales based milestone payments and escalating royalties based on product sales in south korea 
the term of the agreement ends on the later of fifteen years following launch of the product or the expiration date of the last to expire patent 
in november  we entered into a license  supply and distribution agreement with teva for an auto injector product containing sumatriptan for the treatment of migraines 
we will manufacture the device and do final assembly and packaging of the final product  and teva will manufacture and supply the drug and will distribute the product in the united states 
teva also received an option for rights in other territories 
under the agreement  we received an upfront payment and will receive a milestone payment upon commercial launch 
in addition  net profits will be split between us and teva 
the term of the agreement is seven years from commercial launch  with automatic one year renewals unless terminated by either party after the initial term 
distribution supply agreements are arrangements under which our products are supplied to end users through the distributor or supplier 
we provide the distributor supplier with injection devices and related disposable components  and the distributor supplier often receives a margin on sales 
we currently have a number of us distribution supply arrangements under which the distributors suppliers sell our needle free injection devices and related disposable components for use with insulin 
competition competition in the methotrexate market includes tablets and parenteral forms that are currently marketed in the us by several generic manufacturers  including teva  mylan  roxane  bedford labs  app pharmaceuticals  and hospira

other commonly used pharmaceutical treatments for rheumatoid arthritis include analgesics  non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids  corticosteroids  so called disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs dmards and biologic response modifiers 
in addition to methotrexate  the dmards include azathioprine imuran  cyclosporine neoral  hydroxychloroquine plaquenil  auranofin ridura  leflunomide arava and sulfasalazine azulfidine 
the biologic response modifiers include etanercept enbrel  adalimumab humira  golimumab simponi  tocilizumab actemra  certolizumab cimzia  infliximab remicaid  abatacept orencia  and rituximab rituxan 
they are often prescribed in combination with dmards such as methotrexate 
because biologics work by suppressing the immune system  they could be problematic for patients who are potentially prone to frequent infection 

table of contents competition in the us testosterone replacement market includes abbvie s androgel and androgel  lilly s axiron  endo pharmaceuticals fortesta and delatestryl  pfizer s depo testosterone  actavis androderm  auxillium s testim  actient s striant and testopel and several generic testosterone in oil products sold by actavis  sandoz  mylan  bedford labs  teva and others

competition in the hgh market consists of products from several manufacturers  including humatrope lilly  norditropin novonordisk  genotropin pfizer  nutropin roche genentech  omnitrope sandoz  serostim emd serono  saizen emd serono  zorptive emd serono  and tev tropin teva 
while all hgh products currently available in the united states are exclusively produced from recombinant technology in the form of somatropin  individual hgh products vary in the indications for which they are approved  the formulations ready to use liquids and lyophyllized powder for reconstitution  strengths  and drug delivery systems eg  vials for use with conventional needle and syringe  pre filled syringes  pens  needle free auto injectors in which they are available 
approved indications include growth hormone deficiency in children  turner s syndrome  prader willi syndrome  noonan syndrome  small for gestational age sga  growth delay in children with chronic renal failure and shox short stature homeobox containing gene gene deletion 
approved indications in adults includes growth hormone deficiency in adults  continuation of therapy from growth hormone deficiency in childhood  treatment of aids wasting  and treatment of short bowel syndrome 
different manufacturers hgh products may or may not be approved for one or more of the indicated uses  which  along with differences in formulation  available strengths  drug delivery devices  promotional activities  and price discounts and rebates all combine to form a highly complex and competitive hgh market 
competition in the hormone replacement market consists of products from several manufacturers  including premarin tablets pfizer  premarin vaginal cream pfizer  vagifem novonordisk  estrace warner chilcott  vivelle dot novartis  estradiol transdermal system mylan  climara bayer 
our gel product elestrin is competing against oral tablets  vaginal creams and transdermal patches  which together make up nearly of the us market for hormone replacement therapy 
competition in the disposable  single use injector market includes  but is not limited to  ypsomed ag  shl group ab  owenmumford ltd  west pharmaceuticals  becton dickinson  haselmeir gmbh  elcam medical and vetter pharma  while competition in the reusable needle free injector market includes bioject medical technologies inc and the medical house plc 
additionally  in the drug injection field we face competition from internal groups within large pharmaceutical companies as well as design houses which complete the design of devices for companies but don t have manufacturing management capabilities 
competition in the injectable drug delivery market is intensifying 
we face competition from traditional needles and syringes as well as newer pen like and sheathed needle syringes and other injection systems as well as alternative drug delivery methods including oral  transdermal and pulmonary delivery systems 
nevertheless  the majority of injections are still currently administered using needles 
because injections are typically only used when other drug delivery methods are not feasible  the auto injector systems may be made obsolete by the development or introduction of drugs or drug delivery methods which do not require injection for the treatment of conditions we have currently targeted 
in addition  because we intend to  at least in part  enter into collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies  our competitive position will depend upon the competitive position of the pharmaceutical company with which we collaborate for each drug application 

table of contents industry trends based upon our experience in the healthcare industry  we believe the following significant trends in healthcare have important implications for the growth of our business 
major pharmaceutical companies market directly to consumers and encourage the use of innovative  user friendly drug delivery systems  offering patients an ability to self inject products at home 
we believe the patient friendly attributes of our injection technologies meet these market needs 
many drugs  including selected protein biopharmaceuticals  are degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and may only be administered through the skin by injection 
injection therefore remains the mainstay of protein delivery 
the growing number of protein biopharmaceuticals requiring injection may have limited commercial potential if patient compliance with conventional injection treatment is not optimal 
the failure to take all prescribed injections can lead to increased health complications for the patient  decreased drug sales for pharmaceutical companies and increased healthcare costs for society 
in addition  it is becoming increasingly recognized that conventional needles and syringes are inherently unreliable and require special and often costly disposal methods 
industry expectations are that improvements in protein delivery methods such as our injector systems will continue to be accepted by the market 
in addition to the increase in the number of drugs requiring self injection  recommended changes in the frequency of injections may contribute to an increase in the number of self injections 
in march  congress passed the biologics price competition and innovation act as part of the patient protection and affordable care act 
this legislation creates a pathway for regulatory approval  authorizing the fda to establish criteria for review and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products that are similar to the innovator biologic after patent and exclusivity expiration of the innovator product 
the approval of biosimilar products is intended to reduce the cost of biological products by increasing competition just as the hatch waxman legislation did by creating an abbreviated pathway for approval of generic drugs 
in order to differentiate between different version of similar biologic agents  novel patented delivery systems are becoming more important to extend product proprietary position as well as secure patient preference 
furthermore  patented pharmaceutical products continue to be challenged by generic companies once substantial proprietary sales are generated 
all of our proprietary device systems may provide pharmaceutical companies with the ability to protect and extend the life of a product 
when a drug loses patent protection  the branded version of the drug typically faces competition from generic alternatives 
it may be possible to preserve market share by altering the delivery method 
we expect branded and specialty pharmaceutical companies will continue to seek differentiating device characteristics to defend against generic competition and to optimize convenience to patients 
the new device may offer therapeutic advantages  convenience or improved dosing schedules 
major pharmaceutical companies now focus on life cycle management of their products to maximize return on investment and often consider phased product improvement opportunities to maintain competitiveness 
recently a trend has emerged where companies are now focusing on branded generics wherein an established drug is coupled with a device technology in order to improve the drug utility to the patient or improve the ease of use of an injectable drug 
this concept is the basis of our otrexup and vibex qs t products and potentially provides the pharmaceutical company a high value branded product 
finally  our device platforms work well in the generic marketplace  the opposite end of the branded strategy 
there are a large number of injectable branded products losing patent protection in the near term which will be or have been subject to the abbreviated new drug application anda pathway 
three of our potential products with our partner teva epinephrine  sumatriptan and an undisclosed product in our pen technology are being developed as generic substitutes to the branded products 
unlike branded products which need to be detailed to a physician by a sales force  a generic product with an ab rating is substituted at the pharmacy in lieu of the branded product affording a potentially low cost  high penetration generic product 
our device platform allows for device customization which can provide multiple opportunities in the generic market space 

table of contents seasonality of business we do not believe our business  either device or pharmaceutical  is subject to seasonality 
we are subject to and affected by the business practices of our pharmaceutical device partners 
inventory practices  such as safety stock levels  of our partners may subject us to product sales fluctuations quarter to quarter or year over year 
additionally  development revenue we derive from our partners is subject to fluctuation based on the number of programs being conducted by our partners as well as delays or lack of funding for those programs 
proprietary rights when appropriate  we actively seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of us and international patents and trademarks 
we currently hold numerous patents and numerous additional patent applications pending in the us and other countries 
our patents have expiration dates ranging from to in addition to issued patents and patent applications  we are also protected by trade secrets in all of our technologies 
some of our technology is developed on our behalf by independent outside contractors 
to protect the rights of our proprietary know how and technology  company policy requires all employees and consultants with access to proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside the company 
these agreements also require disclosure and assignment to us of discoveries and inventions made by such individuals while devoted to company sponsored activities 
companies with which we have entered into development agreements have the right to certain technology developed in connection with such agreements 
third party reimbursement and pricing in both us and foreign markets  our ability to commercialize otrexup successfully depends in significant part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payers  including  in the us  government payers such as the medicare and medicaid programs  managed care organizations and private health insurers 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness  in addition to their safety and efficacy 
this is especially true in markets where generic options exist 
third party payers may use tiered reimbursement and may adversely affect demand for otrexup by placing it in a more expensive tier 
we cannot be certain that otrexup will successfully be placed on the list of drugs covered by particular health plan formularies 
many states have also created preferred drug lists and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate 
if otrexup is not included on these preferred drug lists  physicians may not be inclined to prescribe it to their medicaid patients  thereby diminishing the potential market for otrexup 
we may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of otrexup for formulary coverage and reimbursement 
even with studies  otrexup may be considered less safe  less effective or less cost effective than existing products  and third party payers may not provide coverage and reimbursement for otrexup  in whole or in part 
political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the us to fundamental changes 
there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our future business 
for example  the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  or collectively the ppaca  enacted in march  substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers 
among other cost containment measures  ppaca establishes an annual  nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents  a new medicare part d coverage gap discount program  in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under part d must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period the donut hole  and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the medicaid drug rebate program 

table of contents in the future  there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the us healthcare system 
certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for otrexup or the amounts of reimbursement available for otrexup  and could limit the acceptance and availability of otrexup 
approval of otrexup may be delayed or rejected based upon changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review 
changes in regulatory approval policy  regulations or statutes or the process for regulatory review during products development or approval periods may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application 
the adoption of some or all of these proposals could materially impact numerous aspects of our business 
our partnered products encounter the same issues with reimbursement stated above 
although we do not control the reimbursement rate or discounts contracted with third party payers by our partners  it ultimately affects our royalty payments on products such as tev tropin and gelnique 
we have encountered a widening gap between gross sales and net sales after discounts on both of these products which has negatively affected our royalty revenue 
government regulation any potential products discovered  developed and manufactured by us or our collaborative partners must comply with comprehensive regulation by the fda in the united states and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state  and local entities regulate  among other things  the pre clinical and clinical testing  safety  effectiveness  approval  manufacturing operations  quality  labeling  distribution  marketing  export  storage  record keeping  event reporting  advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 
facilities and certain company records are also subject to inspections by the fda and comparable authorities or their representatives 
the fda has broad discretion in enforcing the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fd c act and the regulations thereunder  and noncompliance can result in a variety of regulatory steps ranging from warning letters  product detentions  device alerts or field corrections to mandatory recalls  seizures  manufacturing shut downs  injunctive actions and civil or criminal actions or penalties 
drug approval process pharmaceutical based products or drug delivery technologies indicated for the treatment of systemic or local treatments respectively are regulated by the fda in the us and other similar regulatory agencies in other countries as drug products 
drug delivery based products are considered to be controlled release dosage forms and may not be marketed in the us until they have been demonstrated to be safe and effective 
the regulatory approval routes for products include the filing of an nda for new drugs  new indications of approved drugs or new dosage forms of approved drugs 
alternatively  these dosage forms can obtain marketing approval as a generic product by the filing of an anda  providing the new generic product is bioequivalent to and has the same labeling as a comparable approved product or as a filing under section b of the fd c act where there is an acceptable reference product 
the combination of the drug  its dosage form and label claims  and fda requirements will ultimately determine which regulatory approval route will be required 
the process required by the fda before a new drug pharmaceutical product or a new route of administration of a pharmaceutical product may be approved for marketing in the united states generally involves pre clinical laboratory and animal tests  submission to the fda of an ind application  which must be in effect before clinical trials may begin  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for its intended indication s  fda compliance inspection and or clearance of all manufacturers  submission to the fda of an nda  and fda review of the nda or product license application in order to determine  among other things  whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended uses 

table of contents pre clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation  as well as animal studies  to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product 
certain pre clinical tests must comply with fda regulations regarding current good laboratory practices 
the results of the pre clinical tests are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  to support human clinical trials and are reviewed by the fda  with patient safety as the primary objective  prior to the ind commencement of human clinical trials 
clinical trials are conducted according to protocols that detail matters such as a description of the condition to be treated  the objectives of the study  a description of the patient population eligible for the study and the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy 
each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
protocols must be conducted in accordance with fda regulations concerning good clinical practices to ensure the quality and integrity of clinical trial results and data 
failure to adhere to good clinical practices and the protocols may result in fda rejection of clinical trial results and data  and may delay or prevent the fda from approving the drug for commercial use 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  which may overlap 
during phase i  when the drug is initially given to human subjects  the product is tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  distribution  metabolism and excretion 
phase i studies are often conducted with healthy volunteers depending on the drug being tested 
phase ii involves studies in a limited patient population  typically patients with the conditions needing treatment  to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product for specific  targeted indications  determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
pivotal or phase iii adequate and well controlled trials are undertaken in order to evaluate efficacy and safety in a comprehensive fashion within an expanded patient population for the purpose of registering the new drug 
the fda may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any point in this process if it concludes that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if they decide it is unethical to continue the study 
results of pre clinical and clinical trials must be summarized in comprehensive reports for the fda 
in addition  the results of phase iii studies are often subject to rigorous statistical analyses 
this data may be presented in accordance with the guidelines for the international committee of harmonization that can facilitate registration in the united states  the eu and japan 
fda approval of our own and our collaborators products is required before the products may be commercialized in the united states 
fda approval of an nda will be based  among other factors  on the comprehensive reporting of clinical data  risk benefit analysis  animal studies and manufacturing processes and facilities 
the process of obtaining nda approvals from the fda can be costly and time consuming and may be affected by unanticipated delays 
an snda is a submission to an existing nda that provides for changes to the nda and therefore requires fda approval 
changes to the nda that require fda approval are the subject of either the active ingredients  the drug product and or the labeling 
a supplement is required to fully describe the change 
both before and after market approval is obtained  a product  its manufacturer and the holder of the nda for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight 
violations of regulatory requirements at any stage  including after approval  may result in various adverse consequences  including the fda s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  withdrawal of an approved product from the market and the imposition of criminal penalties against the manufacturer and nda holder 
in addition  later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or nda holder  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
furthermore  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development 
fda approval is required before a generic drug equivalent can be marketed 
we seek approval for such products by submitting an anda to the fda 
when processing an anda  the fda waives the requirement of conducting complete clinical studies  although it normally requires bioavailability and or bioequivalence studies 
bioavailability indicates the extent of absorption of a drug product in the blood stream 
bioequivalence indicates that the active drug substance that is the subject of the anda submission is equivalent to the previously approved drug 
an anda may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of a previously approved drug or  in the case of a new dosage form  is suitable for use for the indications specified 

table of contents the timing of final fda approval of an anda depends on a variety of factors  including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the brand name manufacturer is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods  during which the fda may be prohibited from accepting applications for  or approving  generic products 
in certain circumstances  a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent  and thus block andas from being approved on the patent expiration date 
for example  in certain circumstances the fda may extend the exclusivity of a product by six months past the date of patent expiry if the manufacturer undertakes studies on the effect of their product in children  a so called pediatric extension 
before approving a product  either through the nda or anda route  the fda also requires that our procedures and operations or those of our contracted manufacturer conform to current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations  relating to good manufacturing practices as defined in the us code of federal regulations 
we and our contracted manufacturer must follow the cgmp regulations at all times during the manufacture of our products 
we will continue to spend significant time  money and effort in the areas of production and quality testing to help ensure full compliance with cgmp regulations and continued marketing of our products now or in the future 
if the fda believes a company is not in compliance with cgmp  sanctions may be imposed upon that company including withholding from the company new drug approvals as well as approvals for supplemental changes to existing applications  preventing the company from receiving the necessary export licenses to export its products  and classifying the company as an unacceptable supplier and thereby disqualifying the company from selling products to federal agencies 
our marketed products such as gelnique oxybutynin gel and elestrin  as well as our products being developed by our partners such as nestragel and the undisclosed pfizer product are subject to the above regulations 
device combination products developed by us  such as otrexup or vibex qs t  and being developed by our partner teva are subject to the snda  anda and b regulations cited above  as well as the device approval process below 
device approval process drug delivery systems such as our injectors can also be evaluated as part of the drug approval process such as an nda  snda  anda  b or a product license application pla 
combination drug device products raise unique scientific  technical and regulatory issues 
the fda has established an office of combination products ocp to address the challenges associated with the review and regulation of combination products 
the ocp assists in determining strategies for the approval of drug delivery combinations and assuring agreement within the fda on review responsibilities 
device regulatory filings could take the form of a device master file maf 
in most cases  the device specific information may need to be filed as part of the drug approval submission  and in those cases we will seek agreement from the agency for review of the device portion of the submission by the center for devices and radiological health cdrh under the medical device provisions of the law 
an maf filing typically supports a regulatory filing in the approval pathway 
where common data elements may be part of several submissions for regulatory approval  as in the case of information supporting an injection system  an maf filing with the fda may be the preferred route 
a delivery device that is considered a product only when combined with a drug  and where such a device is applicable to a variety of drugs  represents another opportunity for such a filing 
we intend to pursue such strategies as permitted by the law and as directed by the fda either through guidance documents or discussions 
development of a device with a previously unapproved new drug likely will be handled as part of the nda for the new drug itself 
under these circumstances  the device component will be handled as a drug accessory and will be approved  if ever  only when the nda itself is approved 
our injectors may be required to be approved as a combination drug device product under an snda for use with previously approved drugs 
under these circumstances  our device could be used with the drug only if and when the supplemental nda is approved for this purpose 
it is possible that  for some or even all drugs  the fda may take the position that a drug specific approval must be obtained through a full nda or supplemental nda before the device may be packaged and sold in combination with a particular drug 
teva launched the tjet device in august of for use in delivery of teva s form of hgh  tev tropin  following the approval of the hgh snda in june 
table of contents to the extent that our injectors are packaged with the drug  as part of a drug delivery system  the entire package will be subject to the requirements for drug device combination products 
these include drug manufacturing requirements  drug adverse reaction reporting requirements  and all of the restrictions that apply to drug labeling and advertising 
in general  the drug requirements under the fd c act are more onerous than medical device requirements 
these requirements could have a substantial adverse impact on our ability to commercialize our products and our operations 
the fd c act also regulates quality control and manufacturing procedures by requiring that we and our contract manufacturers demonstrate compliance with the current qsr 
the fda s interpretation and enforcement of these requirements have been increasingly strict in recent years and seem likely to be even more stringent in the future 
the fda monitors compliance with these requirements by requiring manufacturers to register with the fda and by conducting periodic fda inspections of manufacturing facilities 
if the inspector observes conditions that might violate the qsr  the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily 
failure to adhere to qsr requirements would cause the devices produced to be considered in violation of the fda act and subject to fda enforcement action that might include physical removal of the devices from the marketplace 
the fda s medical device reporting regulation requires companies to provide information to the fda on the occurrence of any death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of their products  as well as any product malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
in addition  fda regulations prohibit a device from being marketed for unapproved or uncleared indications 
if the fda believes that a company is not in compliance with these regulations  it could institute proceedings to detain or seize company products  issue a recall  seek injunctive relief or assess civil and criminal penalties against the company or its executive officers  directors or employees 
in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  we must also comply with regulations under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act and other federal  state and local regulations 
foreign approval process in addition to regulations in the united states  we are subject to various foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products 
we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement and the regulatory approval process all vary greatly from country to country 
additionally  the time it takes to complete the approval process in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
foreign regulatory approvals of our products are necessary whether or not we obtain fda approval for such products 
finally  before a new drug may be exported from the united states  it must either be approved for marketing in the united states or meet the requirements of exportation of an unapproved drug under section of the export reform and enhancement act or comply with fda regulations pertaining to inds 
under european union regulatory systems  we are permitted to submit marketing authorizations under either a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all member states of the european union 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions by permitting the holder of a national marketing authorization to submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
sales of medical devices outside of the us are subject to foreign legal and regulatory requirements 
certain of our transdermal and injection systems have been approved for sale only in certain foreign jurisdictions 
legal restrictions on the sale of imported medical devices and products vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval  and the requirements may differ 
we rely upon the companies marketing our injectors in foreign countries to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for sales of our products in those countries 

table of contents we have iso certification  the medical device industry standard for our quality systems 
this certification shows that our device development and manufacturing comply with standards for quality assurance  design capability and manufacturing process control 
such certification  along with compliance with the european medical device directive enables us to affix the ce mark a certification indicating that a product has met eu consumer safety  health or environmental requirements to current products and supply the device with a declaration of conformity 
regular surveillance audits by our notified body  british standards institute  are required to demonstrate continued compliance 
employees we believe that our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the research  development  manufacturing  business development and commercialization fields 
as of march   we had full time employees 
of the employees  are primarily involved in research  development and manufacturing activities  three are primarily involved in business development and commercialization  with the remainder engaged in executive and administrative capacities 
although we believe that we are appropriately sized to focus on our mission  we intend to add personnel with specialized expertise  as needed  particularly in the sales and marketing areas with the potential approval of otrexup in we believe that we have been successful to date in attracting skilled and experienced scientific and business professionals 
we consider our employee relations to be good  and none of our employees are represented by any labor union or other collective bargaining unit

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following risk factors contain important information about us and our business and should be read in their entirety 
additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now believe to be not material could also impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all of your investment 
in this section  the terms the company  we  our and us refer to antares pharma  inc risks related to our operations we have incurred significant losses to date  and there is no guarantee that we will ever become profitable 
we incurred net losses of  and  in the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
in addition  we have accumulated aggregate net losses from the inception of business through december  of  the costs for research and product development of our product candidates and drug delivery technologies along with marketing and selling expenses and general and administrative expenses have been the principal causes of our losses 
we may not ever become profitable and if we do not become profitable your investment would be harmed 
we may need additional capital in the future in order to continue our operations 
in october  we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share in a public offering  and in november we sold  shares of common stock at per share as a result of the partial exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the sales of common stock resulted in net proceeds of  after deducting offering expenses of  in may  we sold a total of  shares of common stock at a price of per share in a public offering  which resulted in net proceeds of  after deducting offering expenses of  in addition  we received proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises of  and  in and  respectively 
if in the future we do not turn profitable or generate cash from operations and additional capital is needed to support operations  economic and market conditions may make it difficult to raise additional funds through debt or equity financings 
at december  we had cash and investments of  the combination of our current cash and investments balance and projected product sales  product development  license revenues  milestone payments and royalties should provide us with sufficient funds to support operations 
however  if funds are not sufficient to support operations  we may need to pursue a financing or reduce expenditures to meet our cash requirements 
if we do obtain such financing  we cannot assure that the amount or the terms of such financing will be as attractive as we may desire 
if we are unable to obtain such financing when needed  or if the amount of such financing is not sufficient  it may be necessary for us to take significant cost saving measures or generate funding in ways that may negatively affect our business in the future 
to reduce expenses  we may be forced to make personnel reductions or curtail or discontinue development programs 
to generate funds  it may be necessary to monetize future royalty streams  sell intellectual property  divest of technology platforms or liquidate assets 
however  there is no assurance that  if required  we will be able to generate sufficient funds or reduce spending to provide the required liquidity 
long term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the status of collaborative arrangements  the progress of research and development programs and the receipt of revenues from sales of products 
our ability to achieve and or sustain profitable operations depends on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following our ability to successfully develop our own product candidates such as otrexup and vibex qs t  our ability to successfully launch and sell our products if we choose not to partner the product  our ability to manufacture products efficiently  at the appropriate commercial scale  and with the required quality  timing of our partners development  regulatory and commercialization plans  the demand for our technologies from current and future pharmaceutical partners  
table of contents our ability to increase and continue to outsource manufacturing capacity to allow for new product introductions  the level of product competition and of price competition  patient acceptance of our current and future products  our ability to obtain reimbursement for our products from third party payers  our ability to develop additional commercial applications for our products  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  our ability to attract the right personnel to execute our plans  our ability to develop  maintain or acquire patent positions  our ability to control costs  and general economic conditions 
we are currently preparing for the fda approval and commercial launch of otrexup and as a company we have limited marketing and no sales capabilities 
we currently are in the process of building a commercial organization for the sales and marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products  and as a company  we have limited experience commercializing pharmaceutical products on our own 
in order to commercialize otrexup  we must build our sales  marketing  distribution  managerial and other non technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
the establishment and development of our own commercial organization to market otrexup and any additional products we may develop will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop this capability 
we will also have to compete with other pharmaceutical companies to recruit  hire  train and retain sales and marketing personnel 
to the extent we rely on additional third parties to commercialize otrexup  such as pharmaceutical partners or third party contract sales organizations  we may receive less revenues or incur more expenses than if we commercialized otrexup ourselves 
in addition  we may have limited control over the sales efforts of any third parties involved in our commercialization efforts 
in the event we are unable to fully develop our own commercial organization or collaborate with a third party sales and marketing organization or enter into co promotion agreements  we may not be able to commercialize otrexup and execute on our business plan 
if we are unable to successfully implement our commercial plans and drive adoption by patients and physicians of otrexup through our sales  marketing and commercialization efforts  or if our partners fail to successfully commercialize otrexup  then we may not be able to generate sustainable revenues from product sales which will have a material adverse effect on our business and future product opportunities 
similarly  we may not be successful in establishing the necessary commercial infrastructure  including managed care  medical affairs and pharmacovigilance teams 
if we do not rapidly expand our internal sales and marketing capabilities and establish the necessary infrastructure or if our efforts to do so take more time and expense than anticipated  our ability to market and sell otrexup may be adversely affected 
commercialization of otrexup will require significant resources and if we do not receive fda approval or achieve the sales expected we may lose the substantial investment made in otrexup 
we have made and are continuing to make substantial expenditures in advance of commercializing otrexup and our other product candidates 
we are devoting substantial resources to building our manufacturing and assembly equipment for otrexup as well as building commercial supply inventories of otrexup to support potential commercialization 
we have and expect to continue to devote substantial resources to establish and maintain a marketing capability for otrexup 
these costs have increased as we near the potential launch of otrexup 
if otrexup or other products we develop are not approved for commercial sale  we may be unable to recover the large investment we have made in research  development  manufacturing and marketing efforts  and our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the failure of any of our third party licensees to develop  obtain regulatory approvals for  market  distribute and sell our products as planned may result in us not meeting revenue and profit targets 
pharmaceutical company partners such as teva help us develop  obtain regulatory approvals for  manufacture and sell our products 
if one or more of these pharmaceutical company partners fail to pursue the development or marketing of the products as planned  our revenues and profits may not reach expectations or may decline 
we may not be able to control the timing and other aspects of the development of products because pharmaceutical company partners may have priorities that differ from ours 
therefore  commercialization of products under development may be delayed unexpectedly 
the success of the marketing organizations of our pharmaceutical company partners  as well as the level of priority assigned to the marketing of the products by these entities  which may differ from our priorities  will determine the success of the products incorporating our technologies 
competition in this market could also force us to reduce the prices of our technologies below currently planned levels  which could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability 
we are currently working with teva on four products vibex with epinephrine  vibex with sumatriptan and undisclosed pen products for which we are anticipating approval and launch in the to timeframe 
additionally  we are working with pfizer on an undisclosed product for which we are anticipating approval and launch in there is no assurance that development of these products will continue or that they will receive fda approval or if fda approved they will be a significant revenue source for us 
we currently depend on a limited number of customers for the majority of our revenue  and the loss of any one of these customers could substantially reduce our revenue and impact our liquidity 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from teva  from actavis and from ferring 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from teva and from ferring 
the revenue from teva was product sales  royalties and license and development revenue 
the revenue from actavis was product sales  manufacturing start up and other development activities  royalties and a milestone payment deferred at december  that was recognized in although significant in  actavis product sales and development revenue is expected to be minimal in  as actavis is assuming manufacturing responsibilities in early the revenue from ferring was primarily product sales and royalties 
the loss of any of these significant customers or partners or reduction in our business activities could cause our revenues to decrease significantly  increase our continuing losses from operations and  ultimately  could require us to cease operations 
if we cannot broaden our customer base  we will continue to depend on a few customers for the majority of our revenues 
additionally  if we are unable to negotiate favorable business terms with these customers in the future  our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and or sustain profitability or continue operations 
we have entered into four license  development and or supply agreements for five potential products since november of with teva or an affiliate of teva 
to date we have received fda approval of one of those products  the tjet needle free device for use with teva s mg tev tropin brand hgh 
teva is currently marketing the tjet device to its patients and we expect product sales and royalties from this product into the future 
although certain upfront  milestone and development payments have been received for the other programs with teva  timelines have been extended and there can be no assurance that there ever will be commercial sales or future milestone payments under these other agreements 
we have a license agreement with ferring  under which ferring commercialized our needle free injection system with their mg and mg hgh formulations marketed as zomajet vision and zomajet vision x  respectively  in europe and asia 
we receive a purchase price and a royalty for each device sold to ferring and a royalty on their hgh sales if we meet certain product quality metrics 
although these products have been on the market for many years  there can be no assurance that ferring will continue to use our device or that approval of new devices developed by us will occur 
in july  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with actavis formerly watson for actavis to commercialize  in the us and canada  our topical oxybutynin gel product  which was subsequently approved by the fda in december under terms of the agreement  actavis has made payments for certain manufacturing start up activities and milestone payments based on the achievement of regulatory approval 
additionally  milestone payments will be made upon the achievement of certain sales levels 
upon launch of the 
table of contents product  we began receiving royalties based on product sales in the us and canada for both our oxybutynin gel product and their oxybutynin gel product gelnique 
in  actavis will assume all responsibility for manufacture and supply of the product 
although milestone payments and royalties have been received from actavis  there is no assurance that future sales based milestones or significant royalties will be received under this agreement 
in december  we announced that we licensed one of our drug delivery technologies to pfizer inc s consumer healthcare business unit to develop an undisclosed product on an exclusive basis for north america 
pfizer will assume full cost and responsibility for all clinical development  manufacturing  and commercialization of the product in the licensed territory  which also includes certain non exclusive territories outside of north america 
we received an upfront payment  and will receive development milestones and sales based milestones  as well as royalties on net sales for three years post launch in the us although an upfront payment has been received  there can be no assurance that there ever will be commercial sales or future milestone payments or royalties under this agreement 
we have recently become more commercially oriented by further developing our own products and less dependent on our pharmaceutical partners  and we may not have sufficient resources to fully execute our plan 
we must make choices as to the drugs that we develop on our own 
we may not make the correct choice of drug or technologies when combined with a drug  which may not be accepted by the marketplace as we expected or at all 
fda approval processes for the drugs and drugs with devices may be longer in time and or more costly and or require more extended clinical evaluation than anticipated 
funds required to bring our own products to market may be more than anticipated or may not be available at all 
we have limited experience in bringing such products to market  therefore  we may experience difficulties in execution of development of internal product candidates 
we are currently developing otrexup with a view to potentially market this product ourselves 
there is no guarantee that the development will be successful or if successful that we will market the product effectively 
if we do not develop and maintain relationships with manufacturers of our drug products or candidates  then we may be unable to successfully manufacture and sell our pharmaceutical products 
we do not possess the facilities to manufacture commercial quantities of our vibex mtx product  otrexup  or any other of our future drug candidates 
we must contract with manufacturers to produce products according to government regulations 
our future development and delivery of our product candidates depends on the timely  profitable and competitive performance of these manufacturers 
a limited number of manufacturers exist which are capable of manufacturing our product candidates 
we may fail to contract with the necessary manufacturers or we may contract with manufactures on terms that may not be favorable to us 
our manufacturers must obtain fda approval for their manufacturing processes  and we have no control over this approval process 
additionally  use of contract manufacturers exposes us to risks in the manufacturer s business such as their potential inability to perform from a technical  operational or financial standpoint 
we have entered into multiple commercial supply agreements with third party manufacturers  including the production of the methotrexate drug substance in pre filled syringes  the final assembly and packaging of otrexup in medi jet auto injectors  the supply of the methotrexate drug substance  the manufacture and partial assembly of medi jet auto injectors  and the manufacture of prefillable syringes 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products ourselves  including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance  quality assurance and adequate training in management of manufacturing staff  the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control  and the possibility of termination or non renewal of the agreement by the third party  based on its own business priorities  at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us 

table of contents we depend on these third party manufacturers to comply with current good manufacturing practice regulations cgmps enforced by the fda and other regulatory requirements and to deliver materials on a timely basis 
in addition  because regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is generally site specific  the fda and other regulatory authorities will repeatedly inspect our current and future third party manufacturers facilities for compliance with cgmps 
if we or our third party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  a regulatory agency may issue warning letters or suspend or withdraw our regulatory approval for approved or in market products  among other things 
any of these actions could delay our development of products  delay the submission of these products for regulatory approval or result in insufficient product quantity to support commercial demand 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
see additional risk factors associated with manufacturing in the section risks related to regulatory matters 
we had contracted with a commercial supplier of pharmaceutical chemicals to supply us with the active pharmaceutical ingredient of oxybutynin for commercial quantities of gelnique in a manner that meets fda requirements via reference of their dmf for oxybutynin 
additionally  we had contracted with patheon  a manufacturing development company  to supply commercial quantities of gelnique in a manner that meets fda requirements 
in  all manufacturing responsibility related to gelnique will be transferred to actavis 
if we do not develop and maintain relationships with manufacturers of our device products  then we may be unable to successfully manufacture and sell our device products 
our device manufacturing for our needle free device has involved the assembly of products from machined stainless steel and composite components in limited quantities 
our planned future device business may necessitate changes and additions to our contract manufacturing and assembly process due to the anticipated larger scale of manufacturing in our business plan 
our devices must be manufactured in compliance with regulatory requirements  in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities while maintaining quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
in the course of these changes and additions to our manufacturing and production methods  we may encounter difficulties  including problems involving scale up  yields  quality control and assurance  product reliability  manufacturing costs  existing and new equipment and component supplies  any of which could result in significant delays in production 
we operate under a manufacturing agreement with minnesota rubber and plastics mrp  a contract manufacturing company  who manufactures and assembles our needle free devices and certain related disposable component parts for our partners teva  ferring and jcr 
there can be no assurance that mrp will be able to continue to meet these regulatory requirements or our own quality control standards 
therefore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully produce and manufacture our products 
our pharmaceutical partners retain the right to audit the quality systems of our manufacturing partner  and there can be no assurance that mrp will be successful in these audits 
any of these failures would negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will also continue to outsource manufacturing of our future disposable injection products to third parties 
such products will be price sensitive and may be required to be manufactured in large quantities  and we have no assurance that this can be done 
additionally  use of contract manufacturers exposes us to risks in the manufacturers business such as their potential inability to perform from a technical  operational or financial standpoint 
we have contracted with nypro  an international manufacturing development company to commercialize our vibex pressure assisted auto injector device  used in such products as our epinephrine auto injector for teva and our proprietary otrexup methotrexate system  in compliance with fda qsr regulations 
any failure by nypro to successfully manufacture the pressure assisted auto injector device in commercial quantities  be in compliance with regulatory regulations  or pass the audits by our internal quality and regulatory group or pharmaceutical partner would have a negative impact on our future revenue expectations 

table of contents we rely on third parties to supply components for our products  and any failure to retain relationships with these third parties could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products 
certain of our technologies contain a number of customized components manufactured by various third parties 
regulatory requirements applicable to manufacturing can make substitution of suppliers costly and time consuming 
in the event that we could not obtain adequate quantities of these customized components from our suppliers  there can be no assurance that we would be able to access alternative sources of such components within a reasonable period of time  on acceptable terms or at all 
the unavailability of adequate quantities  the inability to develop alternative sources  a reduction or interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of components could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market our products 
if transdermal gels do not achieve greater market acceptance  we may not realize significant revenue from these products 
because transdermal gels are not a widely understood method of drug delivery  our partners and consumers may have little experience with such products 
our assumption of value may not be shared by the partner and consumer 
to date  transdermal gels have gained successful entry into only a limited number of markets such as the testosterone replacement market and the pain market 
there can be no assurance that transdermal gels will ever gain market acceptance beyond these markets sufficient to allow us to achieve and or sustain profitable operations in this product area 
elestrin  our transdermal estradiol gel  was launched by biosante s marketing partner bradley in june bradley was acquired by nycomed in february biosante reacquired elestrin from nycomed and in december relicensed all manufacturing  distribution and marketing responsibilities of elestrin to azur 
in january azur was acquired by jazz 
elestrin is currently being marketed in the us by meda  who recently acquired the product from jazz 
the multiple licenses of elestrin and shifting marketing responsibilities has had a negative impact on the marketing efforts of elestrin and to date  the market penetration of elestrin has been low 
gelnique  our transdermal oxybutynin product  competes in a large market dominated by oral products 
to date  transdermal products such as gels and patches have not had overwhelming success in gaining market share 
gelnique was launched in april by our partner actavis 
we are aware that actavis has been sampling the product heavily to physicians like most new product launches  but at this early stage of the product launch we cannot determine what effect  if any  the sampling program has had or will have on general market acceptance or future growth of the product 
as health insurance companies and other third party payers increasingly challenge the products and services for which they will provide coverage  our individual consumers may not be able to receive adequate reimbursement or may be unable to afford to use our products  which could substantially reduce our revenues and negatively impact our business as a whole 
our injector device products are currently sold in the european community and elsewhere for use with human growth hormone and in the united states for use with human growth hormone and insulin 
in the case of human growth hormone  our products are generally provided to users at no cost by the drug supplier 
although it is impossible for us to identify the amount of sales of our products that our customers will submit for payment to third party insurers  at least some of these sales may be dependent in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from these third party healthcare payers 
currently  insurance companies and other third party payers reimburse the cost of certain products on a case by case basis and may refuse reimbursement if they do not perceive benefits to a product s use in a particular case 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and devices  and there can be no assurance that such third party payers will not in the future increasingly reject claims for coverage of the cost of certain of our products 
additionally  even if the product is covered  third party payers are continually seeking larger rebates from the manufacturers of the products for product coverage resulting in less net sales of the product 
insurance and third party payer practice vary from country to country  and changes in practices could negatively affect our business if the cost burden for our technologies were shifted more to the patient 
therefore  there can be no assurance that adequate levels of reimbursement will be available to enable us to achieve or maintain market acceptance of our products or technologies or maintain price levels sufficient to realize profitable operations 
there is also a possibility of increased government control or influence over a broad range of healthcare expenditures in the future 
any such trend could negatively impact the market for our drug delivery products and technologies 

table of contents elestrin  for which we receive royalties from our partner based on net commercial sales  was launched in june since it is not our product  we have no way of knowing at this time if health insurance companies reimbursement has negatively impacted patient use of elestrin 
the sales of elestrin are growing month over month but continue to be modest 
gelnique  for which we receive royalties from our partner based on net sales  was launched in april it is too early at this point to determine if third party reimbursement has had an impact on product acceptance 
our tjet device was launched by teva in the us in for use with teva s hgh  tev tropin 
although teva currently provides the device and disposables at no cost to the patient  the amount of health insurance reimbursement of tev tropin has a direct impact on the device product sales and royalty due from teva to us 
additionally  teva has provided significant rebates to third party payers  which reduces net sales of tev tropin thus reducing the royalty payable to us 
the loss of any existing licensing agreements or the failure to enter into new licensing agreements could substantially affect our revenue 
one of our business strategies to reduce development risk is to enter into license agreements with pharmaceutical companies covering the development  manufacture  use and marketing of our drug delivery devices with specific drug therapies 
under these arrangements  the partners typically assist us in the development of the product and sponsor the collection of the appropriate data for submission for regulatory approval of the use of the drug delivery device with the licensed drug therapy 
our licensees may also be responsible for distribution and marketing of the product or technologies for these therapies either worldwide or in specific territories 
we are currently a party to a number of such agreements  all of which are currently in varying stages of development 
we may not be able to meet future milestones established in our agreements such milestones generally being structured around satisfactory completion of certain phases of clinical development  regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product and thus  would not receive the fees expected from such arrangements  related future royalties or product sales 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing additional collaborative agreements or that existing or future agreements will result in increased sales of our drug delivery technologies or products 
in such event  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  and our revenues and gross profits may be insufficient to allow us to achieve and or sustain profitability 
as a result of our collaborative agreements  we are dependent upon the development  data collection and marketing efforts of our licensees 
the amount and timing of resources such licensees devote to these efforts are not within our control  and such licensees could make material decisions regarding these efforts that could adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  factors that adversely impact the introduction and level of sales of any drug or drug device covered by such licensing arrangements  including competition within the pharmaceutical and medical device industries  the timing of regulatory or other approvals and intellectual property litigation  may also negatively affect sales of our drug delivery technology 
we are relying on partners such as teva  ferring  actavis and pfizer for future milestone  sales and royalty revenue 
any or all of these partners may never commercialize a product with our technologies or significant delays in anticipated launches of these products may occur 
any potential loss of anticipated future revenue could have an adverse effect on our business and the value of your investment 
if we cannot develop and market our products as rapidly or cost effectively as our competitors  then we may never be able to achieve profitable operations 
competitors in the methotrexate  overactive bladder  injector device and other markets  some with greater resources and experience than us  may enter these markets  as there is an increasing recognition of a need for less invasive methods of delivering drugs 
our success depends  in part  upon maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in rapidly evolving fields 
if we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies  our current and potential pharmaceutical company partners may choose to adopt the drug delivery technologies of our competitors 
companies that compete with our injector based technologies include ypsomed  owen mumford  elcam  shl  bioject medical technologies  inc  haselmeier  bespak consort medical  west 
table of contents pharmaceuticals and becton dickinson  along with other companies 
we also compete generally with other drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing 
the rheumatoid arthritis market  which is the main focus of our efforts for otrexup  is intensely competitive 
we face competition with respect to otrexup from major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide 
potential competitors also include academic institutions and other public and private research institutions that conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  development  manufacturing and commercialization 
our competitors may develop products that are safer  more effective  have fewer side effects  are more convenient or are less costly than otrexup 
our competitors may also obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for otrexup 
in the rheumatoid arthritis market we face competition from several branded and generic products  many from larger companies that have more experience and greater resources than does our company 
competition in the rheumatoid arthritis market includes tablets and parenteral forms of methotrexate that are currently marketed in the us by several generic manufacturers  including teva  mylan  roxane  bedford labs  app pharmaceuticals and hospira 
in several european countries  canada  and south korea  medac international or its licensees market methotrexate in prefilled syringes metoject 
other commonly used pharmaceutical treatments for rheumatoid arthritis include analgesics  non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids  corticosteroids  so called disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs dmards and biologic response modifiers 
in addition to methotrexate  the dmards include azathioprine imuran  cyclosporine neoral  hydroxychloroquine plaquenil  auranofin ridura  leflunomide arava and sulfasalazine azulfidine 
the biologic response modifiers include blockbuster products etanercept enbrel  adalimumab humira  golimumab simponi  tocilizumab actemra  certolizumab cimzia  infliximab remicaid  abatacept orencia  and rituximab rituxan 
they are often prescribed in combination with dmards such as methotrexate 
the biologics price competition and innovation act permits the fda to approve biosimilar versions of biological products like humira  enbrel  simponi  cimzia  orencia  actemra  rituxan and remicaid through an abbreviated approval pathway 
this regulatory pathway could result in earlier entry of lower cost biosimilars which could lower our value proposition of otrexup relative to that of costlier branded biologics 
the approval of lower cost biosimilar products could decrease the revenue we receive for otrexup 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  pre clinical testing  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and distributing approved products than we do 
smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
these competitors also compete with us in acquiring products  product candidates and technologies complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business 
although not currently approved for subcutaneous administration  we may face competition from generic versions of injectable methotrexate offered at substantially lower cost 
manufacturers may seek approval to market low cost generic products without the cost and benefit of an auto injector which could appeal to third party payers and reduce the market penetration of otrexup 
additionally  injection technologies are mostly used with drugs for which oral drug delivery methods are not possible 
many companies  both large and small  are engaged in research and development efforts on less invasive methods of delivering drugs that cannot be taken orally or effectively developing an oral product that was once thought not possible 
the successful development and commercial introduction of such non injection techniques could have an adverse effect on our business 
although we have applied for  and have received  several patents  we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  which would negatively affect our ability to compete 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents for our products and device technologies and to preserve our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
if we cannot do so  our competitors may exploit our innovations and deprive us of the ability to realize revenues and profits from our developments 

table of contents we currently hold numerous patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the us and other countries 
our current patents may not be valid or enforceable and may not protect us against competitors that challenge our patents  obtain their own patents that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business  or are able to otherwise circumvent our patents 
additionally  our products and technologies are complex and one patent may not be sufficient to protect our products where a series of patents may be needed 
further  we may not have the necessary financial resources to enforce or defend our patents or patent applications 
in addition  any patent applications we may have made or may make relating to inventions for our actual or potential products and technologies may not result in patents being issued or may result in patents that provide insufficient or incomplete coverage for our inventions 
to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technologies and processes  we rely  in part  on confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and advisors 
these agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure  or if others lawfully and independently develop the same or similar information 
others may bring infringement claims against us  which could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
third parties may claim that the manufacture  use or sale of our drug delivery technologies infringe their patent rights 
if such claims are asserted  we may have to seek licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those patents in the patent office or the courts 
if these are not resolved favorably  we may not be able to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
even if we were able to obtain rights to a third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors potential access to the same intellectual property 
if we are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid or unenforceable  we may be liable for significant monetary damages  encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by patents of others 
any litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
we may not have identified  or be able to identify in the future  united states or foreign patents that pose a risk of potential infringement claims 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our product candidates as a result of patent infringement claims  which could potentially harm our business 
in november  meridian medical technologies meridian received us patent  the patent relating to a specific type of auto injector for use with epinephrine 
the patent is set to expire in september the patent was listed in fda s orange book in july under the epipen nda 
on july   meridian and king pharmaceuticals  inc king received a copy of paragraph iv certification from teva giving notice that teva had filed an anda to commercialize an epinephrine injectable product and referring to our auto injector device and challenging the validity and alleging non infringement of the patent 
on august   king and meridian filed suit against teva in the us district court for the district of delaware asserting its patent 
on october   teva filed its answer asserting non infringement and invalidity of the patent 
on november   meridian and king requested to dismiss their claims against teva involving the patent  and the court entered the dismissal on november   removing the patent from the litigation 
in september  king received us patent no 
 the patent relating to certain features of an auto injector for use with epinephrine 
the patent is set to expire in september the patent was listed in fda s orange book in september under the epipen nda 
in november  meridian and king received a copy of paragraph iv certification from teva challenging the validity and alleging non infringement of the patent 
king and meridian filed an amended complaint  in the same litigation as the patent  adding the patent 
in october  pfizer announced it was acquiring king  and the acquisition was completed on or about march  on january   teva filed its answer asserting non infringement and invalidity of the patent 

table of contents on february   the case proceeded to trial in the u 
s district court for the district of delaware 
one day of the bench trial was held on that day 
the court scheduled the remaining days of trial for march  on april  the company announced that meridian medical technologies  a pfizer subsidiary  entered into a settlement agreement with teva that would resolve pending patent litigation related to its abbreviated new drug application anda for a generic epinephrine auto injector 
according to the terms of the settlement  teva may launch a generic epinephrine auto injector covered by its anda on june  or earlier under certain circumstances  subject to receipt of approval from the us food and drug administration 
under a separate agreement  teva has agreed to provide the company with device orders of an undisclosed amount in the years and  to make a milestone payment to the company upon fda approval of epinephrine auto injector  and to assume all litigation costs related to the patent litigation between teva and meridian medical 
although the litigation has been settled  there can be no assurance that the epinephrine auto injector product will be approved by the fda or that we will receive a milestone payment or royalties in the future under our agreement with teva 
additionally  we are developing other products for teva under the anda pathway and there can be no assurance that those products do not follow the same type of litigation process of the epinephrine case which could delay or prohibit the launch of those potential products 
if we do not have adequate insurance for product liability or clinical trial claims  then we may be subject to significant expenses relating to these claims 
our business entails the risk of product liability and clinical trial claims 
although we have not experienced any material claims to date  any such claims could have a material adverse impact on our business 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
we maintain product and clinical trial liability insurance with coverage of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million and evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis 
if we are subject to a product liability claim  our product liability insurance may not reimburse us  or may not be sufficient to reimburse us  for any expenses or losses that may have been suffered 
a successful product liability claim against us  if not covered by  or if in excess of our product liability insurance  may require us to make significant compensation payments  which would be reflected as expenses on our statement of operations 
adverse claim experience for our products or licensed technologies or medical device  pharmaceutical or insurance industry trends may make it difficult for us to obtain product liability insurance or we may be forced to pay very high premiums  and there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
additionally  if the coverage limits of the product liability insurance are not adequate  a claim brought against us  whether covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
if we make any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and might never successfully integrate the acquired product or business into ours 
we might attempt to acquire products or businesses that we believe are a strategic complement to our business model 
we might encounter operating difficulties and expenditures relating to integrating an acquired product or business 
these acquisitions might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
in addition  we might never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
we might also make dilutive issuances of equity securities  incur debt or experience a decrease in cash available for our operations  or incur contingent liabilities and or amortization expenses relating to goodwill and other intangible assets  in connection with future acquisitions 
risks related to regulatory matters we or our licensees may incur significant costs seeking approval for our products  which could delay the realization of revenue and  ultimately  decrease our revenues from such products 

table of contents the design  development  testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds and medical devices are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  including the fda and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries 
the approval process is generally lengthy  expensive and subject to unanticipated delays 
currently we  along with our partners  are actively pursuing marketing approval for a number of products from regulatory authorities in other countries and anticipate seeking regulatory approval from the fda for products developed internally and pursuant to our license agreements 
in the future we  or our partners  may need to seek approval for newly developed products 
our revenue and profit will depend  in part  on the successful introduction and marketing of some or all of such products by our partners or us 
applicants for fda approval often must submit extensive clinical data and supporting information to the fda 
varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre clinical and clinical testing could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval of a drug product 
changes in fda approval policy during the development period  or changes in regulatory review for each submitted nda also may cause delays or rejection of an approval 
even if the fda approves a product  the approval may limit the uses or indications for which a product may be marketed  or may require further studies 
the fda also can withdraw product clearances and approvals for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if unforeseen problems follow initial marketing 
we are developing our own combination products such as otrexup and vibex qs t testosterone as well as injection devices for use with our partner s drugs 
the regulatory path for approval of such combination products may be subject to review by several centers within the fda and although precedent and guidance exists for the requirements for such combination products  there is no assurance that the fda will not change what it requires or how it reviews such submissions 
human clinical testing may be required by the fda in order to commercialize these products and devices and there can be no assurance that such trials will be successful 
such changes in review processes or the requirement for clinical studies could delay anticipated launch dates or be at a cost which makes launching the product or device cost prohibitive for ourselves or our partners 
such delay or failure to launch these products or devices could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability 
in december  we filed a new drug application for otrexup for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra  poly articular course juvenile ra and psoriasis 
on february   the nda was accepted for filing by the fda 
we cannot offer any assurances or predict with any certainty as to when or if the fda will approve otrexup for marketing 
fda approval  if obtained  may be limited to specific indications  patient types in which the drug may be used  or otherwise require specific warning or labeling language  any of which might reduce the commercial potential of otrexup 
furthermore  previously unknown issues involving safety or efficacy could emerge or the company may fail to comply with post approval regulatory requirements  including requirements with respect to manufacturing practices  reporting of adverse effects  advertising  promotion and marketing  which may result in restrictions on the marketing of otrexup or the withdrawal of otrexup from the market 
in december  one of our device partners  teva  filed an anda for their epinephrine product 
the anda submission was accepted by the fda 
teva is in the process of completing the work required for the submission 
the submission of the anda does not ensure that the fda will approve the filing and without fda approval we cannot market or sell our injector for use with this drug product in the us in  our partner teva filed a second injector device with sumatriptan as an anda and the fda rejected such filing 
the fda s rejection was based primarily on the opinion that the device was sufficiently different than the innovator s device not to warrant an anda 
we redesigned the device to address the fda s concern of device similarity and submitted the new device to the fda 
the fda reactivated the anda file in  and since that time we have successfully completed user studies and are scaling up commercial tooling and molds for the newly designed device 
teva is completing some required manufacturing work related to the drug and we expect to submit the results later in  then the fda is expected to complete its review of the anda  the timing of which is completely dependent on the fda 
the reactivation of the anda does not ensure that the fda will approve the filing and without fda approval we cannot market or sell our injector for use with sumatriptan in the us as part of our device regulatory strategy  we have filed three mafs with the fda 
these mafs are reviewed as part of a product application review 
amendments are made to the mafs as appropriate either because of design changes  additional test data or in response to questions from the fda 
the submission of a maf does not guarantee that the maf contains all the information required for product approval 

table of contents in other jurisdictions  we  and the pharmaceutical companies with whom we are developing technologies both drugs and devices  must obtain required regulatory approvals from regulatory agencies and comply with extensive regulations regarding safety and quality 
if approvals to market the products are delayed  if we fail to receive these approvals  or if we lose previously received approvals  our revenues may not materialize or may decline 
we may not be able to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals 
additionally  clinical data that we generate or obtain from partners from fda regulatory filings may not be sufficient for regulatory filings in other jurisdictions and we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining those regulatory approvals 
in  our partner daewoong filed with the regulatory agency in south korea for approval of our oxybutynin gel product 
we cannot offer any assurances or predict with any certainty as to when or if our oxybutynin gel product will be approved for marketing in south korea 
if approval is delayed or is not received  we may not realize any further revenues under this agreement 
the b and j anda regulatory pathway for many of our potential products is uncertain and could result in unexpected costs and delays of approvals 
drug device combination products indicated for the treatment of systemic or local treatments respectively are regulated by the fda in the us and other similar regulatory agencies in other countries as drug products 
drug device combination products may not be marketed in the us until they have been demonstrated to be safe and effective 
the regulatory approval routes for drug device combination products include the filing of an nda for new drugs  new indications of approved drugs or new dosage forms of approved drugs 
alternatively  these dosage forms can obtain marketing approval as a generic product by the filing of an anda  providing the new generic product is bioequivalent to and has the same labeling as a comparable approved product or as a filing under section b where there is an acceptable reference product 
the combination of the drug  its dosage form and label claims and fda requirement will ultimately determine which regulatory approval route will be required 
many of our drug device combination product candidates may be developed via the b route 
the b regulatory pathway is continually evolving and advice provided in the present is based on current standards  which may or may not be applicable when we potentially submit an nda 
additionally  we must reference the most similar predicate products when submitting a b application 
it is therefore probable that should a more appropriate reference product s be approved by the fda at any time before or during the review of our nda  we would be required to submit a new application referencing the more appropriate product  the fda cannot disclose whether such predicate product s is under development or has been submitted at any time during another company s review cycle 
drug delivery systems such as injectors are reviewed by the fda and may be legally marketed as a medical device or may be evaluated as part of the drug approval process 
combination drug device products raise unique scientific  technical and regulatory issues 
the fda has established the ocp to address the challenges associated with the review and regulation of combination products 
the ocp assists in determining strategies for the approval of drug delivery combinations and assuring agreement within the fda on review responsibilities 
we may seek approval for a product including an injector and a generic pharmaceutical by filing an anda claiming bioequivalence and the same labeling as a comparable referenced product or as a filing under section b if there is an acceptable reference product 
in reviewing the anda filing  the agency may decide that the unique nature of combination products allows them to dispute the claims of bioequivalence and or same labeling resulting in our re filing the application under section b 
if such combination products require filing under section b we may incur delays in product approval and may incur additional costs associated with testing including clinical trials 
the result of an approval for a combination product under section b may result in additional selling expenses and a decrease in market acceptance due to the lack of substitutability by pharmacies or formularies 

table of contents if the use of our injection devices require additions to or modifications of the drug labeling regulated by the fda  the review of this labeling may be undertaken by the fda s office of surveillance and epidemiology ose 
additionally  the instructions for use ifu for a device in a drug device combination product is also reviewed for accuracy  ease of use and educational requirements 
these reviews could increase the time needed for review completion of a successful application and may require additional studies  such as usage studies  to establish the validity of the instructions 
such reviews and requirement may extend the time necessary for the approval of drug device combinations 
such was the case for the approval of our needle free device for use with hgh 
the approval process took much more time than contemplated 
accordingly  these regulations and the fda s interpretation of them might impair our ability to obtain product approval or effectively market our products 
our business could be harmed if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements and  as a result  are subject to sanctions 
if we  or pharmaceutical companies with whom we are developing technologies  fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the pharmaceutical companies  and we  may be subject to sanctions  including the following warning letters  fines  product seizures or recalls  injunctions  refusals to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the applicable regulatory jurisdiction  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  or criminal prosecutions 
our revenues may be limited if the marketing claims asserted about our products are not approved 
once a drug product is approved by the fda  the division of drug marketing  advertising and communication  the fda s marketing surveillance department within the center for drugs  must approve marketing claims asserted by our pharmaceutical company partners 
if we or a pharmaceutical company partner fails to obtain from the division of drug marketing acceptable marketing claims for a product incorporating our drug technologies  our revenues from that product may be limited 
marketing claims are the basis for a product s labeling  advertising and promotion 
the claims the pharmaceutical company partners are asserting about our drug delivery technologies  or the drug product itself  may not be approved by the office of prescription drug promotion

the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary for an understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes and other information contained in this report 
overview antares pharma  inc is an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and commercializing self administered parenteral pharmaceutical products and technologies and topical gel based products 
we have numerous partnerships with pharmaceutical companies as well as multiple internal product development programs 
we have developed both subcutaneous and intramuscular injection technology systems which include vibex disposable pressure assisted auto injectors  vision reusable needle free injectors  and disposable multi use pen injectors 
we have licensed our reusable needle free injection device for use with human growth hormone hgh to teva pharmaceutical industries  ltd 
teva  ferring pharmaceuticals bv ferring and jcr pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
jcr  with teva and ferring being two of our primary customers 
our needle free injection device is marketed by teva as the tjet injector system to administer their mg tev tropin brand hgh marketed in the us our needle free injection device is marketed by ferring with their mg and mg hgh formulations as zomajet vision and zomajet vision x  respectively  in europe and asia 
we have also licensed both disposable auto and pen injection devices to teva for use in certain fields and territories and are engaged in product development activities for teva utilizing these devices 
in addition to development of products with partners  we are developing our own drug device combination products 
our lead product candidate  otrexup  is a proprietary combination product comprised of a pre filled methotrexate syringe and our medi jet self injection system for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis ra 
on december  we announced submission of a new drug application nda for otrexup and then on february  announced the fda acceptance of that filing for review 
the prescription drug user fee act pdufa goal date for fda approval is october  we have worldwide marketing rights for otrexup and have provided uman an exclusive license to commercialize the product in canada 
our strategy is to potentially commercialize otrexup in the us on our own and to enter into licensing or distribution agreements for commercialization outside the us we are also developing vibex qs t for testosterone replacement therapy for men suffering from symptomatic testosterone deficiency and have conducted a pre ind meeting with the fda as part of preparing to initiate clinical development for this product 
in the gel based product area  we announced with actavis formerly watson pharmaceuticals on april   the launch of gelnique  our topical oxybutynin gel product for the treatment of overactive bladder oab  which was approved by the fda in december we have a licensing agreement with actavis under which actavis is currently marketing gelnique in the us in january  we entered into a licensing agreement with daewoong pharmaceuticals under which daewoong will commercialize this product  once approved in south korea 
our gel portfolio also includes elestrin estradiol gel currently marketed by meda pharma in the us for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause 

table of contents we have two facilities in the us the parenteral products group located in minneapolis  minnesota directs the manufacturing and marketing of our reusable needle free injection devices and related disposables  and develops our disposable pressure assisted auto injector and pen injector systems 
our corporate head office and product development group are located in ewing  new jersey  where our gel based products were developed and where the product development group directs the clinical  regulatory and commercial development of our internal drug device combination products 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management must make decisions that impact reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are considered by management to be the most critical to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements because they require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue relates to product sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment  with limited judgment required related to product returns 
product sales are shipped fob shipping point 
we also enter into license arrangements that are often complex as they may involve license  development and manufacturing components 
licensing and development revenue recognition requires significant management judgment to evaluate the effective terms of agreements  our performance commitments and determination of fair value of the various deliverables under the arrangement 
current applicable accounting standards require a vendor to allocate revenue to each unit of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables 
to separate deliverables into individual units of accounting  there must be evidence of standalone selling price for each deliverable 
the evidence preferred includes either vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence  but a vendor is allowed to make its best estimate of the standalone selling price when neither of these is available 
we have deferred revenue amounts of  at december   where non refundable cash payments have been received  but the revenue is not immediately recognized due to the nature of the respective agreements 
subsequent factors affecting the initial estimate of the effective terms of agreements could either increase or decrease the period over which the deferred revenue is recognized 
due to the requirement to defer significant amounts of revenue and the extended period over which the revenue will be recognized  along with the requirement to recognize certain deferred development costs over an extended period of time  revenue recognized and cost of revenue may be materially different from cash flows 
on an overall basis  our reported revenues can differ significantly from billings and or accrued billings based on terms in agreements with customers 
the table below is presented to help explain the impact of the deferral of revenue on reported revenues  and is not meant to be a substitute for accounting or presentation requirements under us generally accepted accounting principles 
product sales development fees licensing fees and milestone payments royalties billings received and or accrued per contract terms deferred billings received and or accrued deferred revenue recognized total revenue as reported 
table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets  including patent rights  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
this analysis can be very subjective as we rely upon signed distribution or license agreements with variable cash flows to substantiate the recoverability of long lived assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
each year we review patent costs for impairment and identify patents related to products for which there are no signed distribution or license agreements or for which no revenues or cash flows are anticipated 
no impairment charges were recognized in  or the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of patents  which are our only intangible assets subject to amortization  were  and  respectively  at december  and were  and  respectively  at december  the company s estimated aggregate patent amortization expense for the next five years is     and  in    and  respectively 
we have  of goodwill recorded as of december  that relates to our minnesota operations 
we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill on december of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or a sustained significant drop in our stock price 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the minnesota reporting unit to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the minnesota reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the minnesota reporting unit would be allocated to all of its other assets and liabilities based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of the minnesota reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
in evaluating whether the fair value of the minnesota reporting unit was below its carrying amount  we used the market capitalization of the company at december   which was approximately million  to calculate an estimate of fair value of the minnesota reporting unit 
we determined that the percentage of the total market capitalization of the company at december  attributable to the minnesota reporting unit would have to be unreasonably low before the fair value of the minnesota reporting unit would be less than its carrying amount 
in making this determination  we evaluated the activity at the minnesota reporting unit compared to the total company activity  and considered the source and potential value of agreements currently in place  the source of recent product sales and development revenue growth  the source of total company revenue and the source of cash generating activities 
after performing the market capitalization analysis and concluding that the fair value of the minnesota reporting unit was not below its carrying amount  we determined that no further detailed determination of fair value was required 
our evaluation of goodwill completed during  and resulted in no impairment losses 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
product sales were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
prior to  our product sales primarily included sales of reusable needle free injector devices and disposable components 
in  product sales also included the sale of our topical oxybutynin gel product to actavis in connection with their launch of gelnique in april  which was the primary reason for the increase in product sales compared to the prior year  and included sales of pre commercial auto injector and pen injector devices to teva 
product sales to actavis will not continue after the first quarter of  as actavis will assume all manufacturing of gelnique in as contracted 
our sales of injector related products are generated primarily from sales to ferring and teva 
ferring uses our needle free injector with their mg and mg hgh formulations marketed as zomajet vision and zomajet vision x  respectively  in europe and asia 
teva uses our tjet needle free device with their mg hgh tev tropin marketed in the us in  and  revenue from sales of needle free injector devices totaled   and  respectively 
sales of disposable components in  and totaled   and  respectively 
the decreases in sales of devices and disposable components were due to decreases in sales to both ferring and teva 
sales of the hgh drug product for both ferring and teva continue to grow  but we do not control our partners inventory levels of our hgh injectors or disposable components and this can cause significant fluctuations in product sales 
the increase in device sales was due to an increase in sales to ferring 
the increase in sales of disposable components was due to nearly equal increases in sales to teva and ferring 
development revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the revenue in included  and  related to the teva auto injector and pen injector programs  respectively   recognized under our license agreement with actavis   earned when pfizer achieved a development milestone related to its undisclosed consumer healthcare product  and amounts earned under various other agreements 
the revenue in included  and  related to the teva auto injector and pen injector programs  respectively 
the development revenue related to the pen injector program in included the recognition of  of previously deferred development revenue in connection with an amendment  in the first quarter of  to a license  development and supply agreement with teva originally entered into in december of in addition  the development revenue included  earned under the actavis license agreement 
approximately  of the development revenue recognized in was related to auto injector development work under a license  development and supply agreement with teva originally signed in july in  approximately  of revenue was recognized in connection with a pen injector development program with teva 
the balance of the revenue in was attributable primarily to projects related to our gel technology 
licensing revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the licensing revenue in was primarily due to an upfront license fee received in connection with our licensing agreement with daewoong signed in january of this year and license revenue recognized in connection with our license agreement with actavis  as well as additional payments from our partners under various license agreements 
the licensing revenue in was primarily due to an upfront payment from pfizer associated with a license agreement entered into in december  and included revenue recognized that was previously deferred in connection with license agreements with teva  ferring and biosante  including  of revenue previously deferred that was recognized as a result of the amended license  development and supply agreement with teva for a disposable pen injector  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the licensing revenue was primarily due to recognition of revenue deferred in under an exclusive license agreement with ferring  along with a sales based milestone payment from teva and milestone payments received from biosante 
the remaining licensing revenue in each year is primarily due to recognizing portions of previously deferred amounts related to upfront license fees or milestone payments received under various agreements 

table of contents royalty revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we receive royalties from teva and ferring related to needle free injector device sales and or hgh sales  and we receive royalties on sales of elestrin marketed by meda pharma 
in addition  in we received our first royalty payments from actavis on sales of gelnique  which was the primary reason for the increase in royalties in compared to the increase in was primarily due to increases in royalties from teva and ferring 
both companies experienced growth in their hgh business in the royalties in were impacted by first year royalties of  received from teva in connection with sales of their hgh tev tropin 
nearly all remaining royalty revenue in was generated under the license agreement with ferring described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
royalties from ferring are earned on device sales and under a provision in the ferring agreement in which royalties on their hgh sales are triggered by the achievement of certain quality standards 
royalty revenue in each year also included royalties from jcr on sales of hgh and royalties from azur jazz on sales of elestrin 
cost of revenues and gross margins the cost of product sales includes product acquisition costs from third party manufacturers and internal manufacturing overhead expenses 
cost of product sales were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing gross margins of  and  respectively 
the gross margin decrease in was due primarily due to sales of our topical oxybutynin gel product to actavis at a lower gross profit than is realized on injector related product sales 
the gross margin increases in were due primarily to internal manufacturing overhead expenses that decreased as a percent of product sales compared to the prior year as a result of increased sales volumes 
the cost of development revenue consists primarily of direct external costs  some of which may have been previously incurred and deferred 
cost of development revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately   and  of development costs were recognized in  and  respectively  in connection with revenue recognized related to auto injector development programs with teva

development costs in also included costs recognized in connection with revenue recognized under a pen injector development program with teva and projects related to our gel technology 
research and development research and development expenses consist of external costs for studies and analysis activities  design work and prototype development  and salaries and overhead costs 
research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to expenses related to development of otrexup vibex mtx auto injector for delivery of methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  including a fee of approximately  paid in connection with the new drug application submitted to the fda in december external expenses in connection with the otrexup program totaled approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development was also impacted by expenses of approximately  related to vibex qs t for testosterone replacement therapy and an increase in personnel costs due mainly to employee additions of approximately  the decrease in compared to the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in expenses following completion of the phase iii study of our oxybutynin gel product and filing of our nda in the fourth quarter of expenses related to our transdermal gel products  primarily our oxybutynin gel product  decreased to approximately of our total research and development expenses in from approximately in expenses for development work to prepare for commercialization and expenses associated with the phase iii study were approximately  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
partially offsetting the decrease in expenses related to our oxybutynin gel product was an increase in external expenses of approximately  related to development of otrexup  along with an increase in personnel costs due to employee additions 
the expenses were partially offset by the receipt of approximately  from the qualifying therapeutic discovery grant program under section d of the internal revenue code 

table of contents sales  marketing and business development sales  marketing and business development expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to expenses of approximately  related to otrexup market research  and an increase of approximately  in employee related expenses due to added sales and marketing personnel  partially offset by a reduction in other professional fees related primarily to services outsourced in that were moved in house in the increase in compared to was primarily due to increases in legal costs in connection with executed and potential partner agreements and professional fees related to market research  along with increases in payroll related expenses  which included noncash stock compensation expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

the increase in was primarily due to increases in payroll related expenses  primarily noncash stock compensation expense  patent related expenses and professional fees 
liquidity and capital resources we have reported net losses of   and  in the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
we have accumulated aggregate net losses from the inception of business through december  of  we have not historically generated  and do not currently generate  enough revenue to provide the cash needed to support our operations  and have continued to operate primarily by raising capital 
in october  we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share in a public offering  and in november we sold  shares of common stock at per share as a result of the partial exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the sales of common stock resulted in net proceeds of  after deducting offering expenses of  proceeds from this offering are being used for further development of otrexup our proprietary mtx medi jet injection system for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  development of the company s proprietary vibex qs t product for male testosterone deficiency and general corporate purposes 
in  we received proceeds of  from the exercise of warrants and stock options  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in may  we received net proceeds of  from the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share in a public offering 
proceeds from this offering were used for development of the company s proprietary vibex mtx methotrexate injection system for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and for general corporate purposes 
in  we received proceeds of  in connection with exercises of options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
at december  we had cash and investments of  all investments are us treasury bills or us treasury notes which we intend to hold to maturity 
we believe that the combination of our current cash and investments balances and projected product sales  product development  license revenues  milestone payments and royalties will provide us with sufficient funds to support operations 
we do not currently have any bank credit lines 
if in the future we do not turn profitable or generate cash from operations as anticipated and additional capital is needed to support operations  we may be unable to obtain such financing  or obtain it on favorable terms  in which case we may be required to curtail development of new products  limit expansion of operations or accept financing terms that are not as attractive as we may desire 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities operating cash inflows are generated primarily from product sales  license and development fees and royalties 
operating cash outflows consist principally of expenditures for manufacturing costs  general and administrative costs  research and development projects including clinical studies  and sales  marketing and business development activities 
net cash used in operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net operating cash outflows were primarily the result of net losses of   and  in  and  respectively  adjusted by noncash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in  the net loss increased by  to  from  in primarily due to an increase in spending associated with otrexup vibex mtx of approximately  including a  nda filing fee  and an increase in personnel costs of approximately  associated mainly with employee additions related to increased research and development activities 
the increase in the net loss due to the increase in expenses was partially reduced by an increase in gross profit of approximately  in  the net loss decreased by  to  from  in primarily as a result of an increase in gross profit of  along with a decrease in operating expenses of  the gross profit increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit related to product sales and to an increase in royalties which have no associated direct cost 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from development activities and a decrease in licensing revenue 
noncash expenses totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of  and due to the loss on disposal of equipment  molds  furniture and fixtures of  related mainly to the write off of a tool replacement 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of  compared to this increase was mainly due to discretionary stock awards granted in that were both higher in number and higher in grant date fair value compared to similar grants in prior years 
in  the change in operating assets and liabilities used cash of  this use of cash was mainly due to a decrease in deferred revenue of  partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of  and an increase in accounts payable of  deferred revenue decreased primarily due to recognition of amounts received and deferred in under our license agreement with actavis and amounts recognized under pen and auto injector development programs with teva 
the increases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and accounts payable were affected by overall company growth which included personnel additions and increases in operating activities  particularly research and development activities 
in  the change in operating assets and liabilities generated cash of  the primary reasons for this were an increase in deferred revenue of  which was due mainly to a payment received from actavis and payments from teva that together exceeded amounts recognized as revenue during that had been deferred in prior years  and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities that totaled  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  and an increase in inventories of  the receivable increase was due to billings to ferring and teva in december for product shipments and development work  nearly all of which was collected in january the inventory increase was due to timing of production of devices and disposable components for order fulfillment in early  along with raw material inventory purchased for production of gelnique launch quantities 
in  the change in operating assets and liabilities used cash of  this use of cash was mainly due to a decrease in deferred revenue of  partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of  and changes in other operating assets and liabilities of  deferred revenue decreased primarily due to recognition of amounts received from teva and ferring in which had been recorded as deferred revenue at the end of accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased primarily due to timing of normal operating activities

this amendment will increase our future cash obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  including any arrangements with any structured finance  special purpose or variable interest entities 
research and development programs during  our research and development activities were primarily related to otrexup vibex mtx  vibex qs t and device development projects 
otrexup vibex mtx 
in december  we submitted a new drug application to the fda for otrexup  a combination product for the delivery of methotrexate mtx using medi jet technology  which nda was accepted for filing on february  otrexup is being developed for subcutaneous administration of mtx to enhance the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra  poly articular course juvenile ra and psoriasis 

table of contents in november  we announced positive results from an open label  randomized  crossover study comparing the systemic availability of otrexup to oral methotrexate in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
this study was designed to compare the relative systemic availability of methotrexate following oral administration to subcutaneous sc self administered methotrexate using the medi jet device 
patients were assigned to one of four dose levels of methotrexate  mg  mg  mg  and mg 
results showed that the systemic availability of methotrexate following oral dosing plateaus above mg 
following administration of methotrexate with medi jet  the systemic availability increased proportionally at every dose  which will extend the range of exposure compared to patients receiving oral therapy 
in september  we announced positive results from an actual human use study in ra patients 
the results of this study showed that self administration of mtx using the vibex mtx medi jet is safe and well tolerated 
following standardized training by site personnel and review of written instructions  all patients performed the self administration successfully 
in addition  the medi jet device functioned correctly and as intended for each and every administration thereby demonstrating reliability and robustness 
results of the ease of use questionnaire indicated that of patients found the medi jet device easy to use and of patients found the instructions and training to be clear and easy to follow 
in june  we announced positive results from a human factors usability study for our medi jet methotrexate injection system 
fifty individuals representing three user groups participated in this study  including ra patients  lay caregivers and healthcare professionals 
in august  we announced positive results from a clinical pk study initiated in the first quarter of evaluating otrexup vibex mtx 
the clinical study evaluated several dose strengths of methotrexate delivered with our medi jet versus conventional needle and syringe administration by a healthcare professional 
in  we entered into an agreement with uman pharma under which both companies will invest jointly to develop and commercialize otrexup vibex mtx 
we will lead the clinical development program and fda regulatory submissions  and will retain rights to commercialize the vibex mtx product outside of canada 
uman pharma will perform formulation development and manufacturing activities to support the registration of vibex mtx and supply methotrexate in prefilled syringes to us for the us market 
uman pharma received an exclusive license to commercialize the vibex mtx product in canada 
as of december   we have incurred external costs of approximately  in connection with our vibex mtx development program  of which approximately  was incurred in including approximately  paid in connection with the new drug application submitted to the fda in december we also incurred approximately  of equipment costs in that have been capitalized and included in equipment  molds  furniture and fixtures at december  we anticipate total spending on this program for development and capital equipment could approach an additional  in as well as sales and marketing expense in of approximately  vibex qs t 
we have initiated development of vibex qs t for testosterone replacement therapy for men suffering from symptomatic testosterone deficiency and recognized expense of approximately  in in connection with this program 
we anticipate spending on this program for development will increase in to approximately  device development projects 
we are also engaged in research and development activities related to our vibex disposable pressure assisted auto injectors and our disposable pen injectors 
we have signed license agreements with teva for our vibex system for use with epinephrine and sumatriptan and for our pen injector device for two undisclosed products 
our pressure assisted auto injectors are designed to deliver drugs by injection from single dose prefilled syringes 
the auto injectors are in the advanced commercial stage of development 
the disposable pen injector device is designed to deliver drugs by injection through needles from multi dose cartridges 
the disposable pen is in the stage of development where devices are being evaluated in user studies and stability programs 
our development programs consist of the determination of the device design  development of prototype tooling  production of prototype devices for testing and clinical studies  performance of clinical studies  and development of commercial tooling and assembly 

table of contents as of december   we have incurred total external costs of approximately  in connection with research and development activities associated with our auto and pen injectors  of which approximately  was incurred in as of december   approximately  of the total costs of  was initially deferred  of which approximately  has been recognized as cost of sales and  remains deferred 
this remaining deferred balance will be recognized as cost of sales over the same period as the related deferred revenue will be recognized 
the development timelines of the auto and pen injectors related to the teva products are controlled by teva 
we expect development related to the teva products to continue in  but the timing and extent of near term future development will be dependent on certain decisions made by teva 
although development work payments and certain upfront and milestone payments have been received from teva  there have been no commercial sales from the auto injector or pen injector programs  timelines have been extended and there can be no assurance that there ever will be commercial sales or future milestone payments under these agreements 
other research and development costs 
in addition to the vibex mtx project  vibex qs t project and the teva related device development projects  we incur direct costs in connection with other research and development projects related to our technologies and indirect costs that include salaries  administrative and other overhead costs of managing our research and development projects 
total other research and development costs were approximately  for the year ended december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb made certain technical corrections and conforming fair value amendments to the fasb accounting standards codification 
the amendments affect various codification topics and apply to all reporting entities within the scope of those topics 
the provisions of the amendments are effective upon issuance  except for amendments that are subject to transition guidance  which will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of the amendment provisions will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the swiss franc to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of our subsidiaries in switzerland are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from transferring funds to our swiss subsidiaries in swiss francs 
in addition  we have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the us dollar in connection with a licensing agreement with ferring  under which certain products sold to ferring and royalties are denominated in euros 
most of our product sales  including a portion of our product sales to ferring  and our development and licensing fees and royalties are denominated in us dollars  thereby significantly mitigating the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on trade receivables 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge against exchange rate risk 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results for the years ended december   and was not material 
we also have limited exposure to market risk due to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because a significant portion of our investments are in debt securities issued by the us government and institutional money market funds 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
to minimize market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future  to hold debt securities to maturity at which time the debt security will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the nature of our marketable securities  we believe that we are not exposed to any material market interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio
