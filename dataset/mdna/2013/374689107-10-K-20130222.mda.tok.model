table of contents operational excellence 
our strategy is to position gibraltar as a low cost provider and a market share leader in product areas that offer the opportunity for sales growth and margin enhancement over the long term 
we focus on operational excellence  including lean initiatives throughout the company to position gibraltar as our customers low cost provider of the products we offer 
we continuously seek to improve our on time delivery  quality and service to position gibraltar as a preferred supplier to our customers 
during recent years  gibraltar invested in new enterprise resource planning erp systems which  among other things  have enabled us to more effectively manage our inventory  forecast customer orders  improve supply chain management and respond more timely to volatile raw material costs 
at the same time  we have significantly reduced our working capital levels while maintaining a high level of customer service 
acquisitions during  gibraltar purchased the assets of four businesses in separate transactions 
the acquired product lines complement and expand the company s product portfolio and customer base in four key us and canadian markets metal grating products for the oil sands region of western canada  function critical components for public infrastructure construction and maintenance  perforated metal products for industrial applications  and sun protection products for new residential construction and home remodeling 
gibraltar funded the aggregate investment of million from existing cash on hand 
gibraltar acquired ds brown on april  for million 
ds brown is the largest us manufacturer of specialty components for the transportation infrastructure industry and has established a leading market position for many of the products offered 
products manufactured and distributed by ds brown include expansion joint systems  structural bearing assemblies  pavement sealing systems  and other specialty components for bridges  highways  and other infrastructure projects 
on june   the company acquired award metals for million 
award metals is a leading regional manufacturer of roof ventilation  roof trims  flashing and rain ware  drywall trims  and specialty clips and connectors for concrete forms used in the new construction and repair and remodel markets 
the ds brown and award metals acquisitions were financed through cash on hand and debt available under our revolving credit facility 
gibraltar s results from operations included acquisitions from the respective dates of acquisition 
divestitures gibraltar sold its united steel products subsidiary usp in march for million 
the sale of usp  along with the acquisitions completed in and provide gibraltar with a broader product offering to construction markets and greater potential for revenue and earnings growth 
these transactions are consistent with management s strategy to position gibraltar as a market leader in the product areas offered by our business and to expand our offering of value added products 
on february   gibraltar completed the sale of the majority of the assets of the processed metal products business 
this transaction finalized our exit from steel processing 
this strategic initiative began in and included the sale of our steel strapping business  the sale of the hubbell steel business  and the sale of the scm powdered metal business 
these divestitures were an ongoing part of our objective to build a company with optimal operating characteristics and improve shareholder value 
we now are focused on the manufacture and distribution of building products where the company has historically generated its highest operating margins 
the divestitures described above were recognized as components of discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
economic trends the end markets served by our business are subject to economic conditions influenced by outside factors which include but are not limited to interest rates  commodity costs  demand for residential construction  the level of non residential construction and infrastructure projects  and demand within the repair and remodel market 
the united states construction markets continued an uneven recovery from an unprecedented recession that began in and led to reduced demand for the products we manufacture and distribute 
in addition  tightened credit markets over the same period may have limited the ability of the end users of our products to obtain financing for construction projects 
while the us economy has grown since the recession  the construction markets continue to face significant challenges 
construction markets have only recovered modestly from the recession and many economic indicators remain at levels well below long term averages 
as an example  the table below shows housing starts in the united states continued to remain significantly below the long term average of million starts per year residential housing starts 
table of contents the decrease in residential housing starts and non residential construction had a significant impact on the operations of our business by contributing to decreased sales volume and profitability 
to respond to current economic conditions facing gibraltar  including weakened end market conditions and volatile commodity costs  we continue to focus on providing a high level of customer service along with maintaining our position as a market share leader and low cost provider of our products 
we strive for operational excellence through lean initiatives and the consolidation of facilities to reduce costs 
as a result  we have closed or consolidated facilities over the past three years  including two during we have also aggressively reduced operating costs throughout the company to maximize cash flows generated from operating activities 
as a result of these restructuring activities  our break even point has decreased significantly since as noted above  commodity raw material prices for materials such as steel  aluminum  and resins  have also fluctuated significantly during the past three years 
these fluctuations impact the cost of raw materials we purchase and the pricing we offer to our customers 
commodity prices fell precipitously during the fourth quarter of and continued to fall during the first two quarters of the rapid decrease in commodity prices led to lower sales prices offered to customers and falling margins on our product sales during much of commodity prices rose in and have somewhat stabilized since such time 
we believe our investment in erp systems and decreased inventory requirements allow us to react better to these fluctuations and have improved our margins 
as a result of the steps we have taken throughout the economic downturn  we have increased liquidity to a strong position 
using cash generated from operations  we have made significant repayments against our outstanding debt and no longer have any amounts outstanding against our revolving credit facility as of year end 
our liquidity as of december  was million including million of cash and million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  the steps taken since the economic downturn in allowed us to return to and sustain profitability for the past two years 
we believe our reduced cost structure and lean manufacturing process will allow us to continue growing our revenue and profitability as the economy continues to improve

table of contents net sales increased by million  or  to million for from net sales of million for the increase from prior year was primarily the result of incremental sales generated by the two acquisitions completed in the second quarter of which contributed million or of the increase in net sales for acquisitions completed in contributed additional net sales of million or an increase of 
net sales from businesses operating in both periods decreased or million  the result of a decrease in pricing to customers offset by a increase in volume 
while volume increased modestly compared to for our products sold into the majority of our geographic markets  this increase was net of declines in volume sold in the west coast residential market and european market 
lower demand for roofing materials resulting from unusually dry weather this year contributed to the lower volumes in the west coast residential market  while weak economic conditions in europe suppressed demand for our industrial and vehicle filtration products 
the lower selling prices were primarily the result of a decline in commodity costs for steel and aluminum and meeting selective competitive situations 
despite our increase in net sales  our gross margin remained unchanged at for both and as we continue consolidating certain of our west coast locations with similar products and market characteristics  we have incurred costs related to this consolidation in we believe completing the initiatives to restructure the west coast locations will lead to improved gross margins in future periods 
the impact to our gross margin from these consolidation costs was offset equally by a more favorable alignment of material costs to customer selling prices and cost reductions 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses decreased by million  or  to million for from million for the million decrease was the net result of a million decrease in equity compensation  million in cost reductions due to consolidation of facilities  a million decrease in other variable incentive compensation and in restructuring and acquisition related costs from the decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in sg a expense as a result of businesses acquired in and from having a full year of sg a expenses from business acquired in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for compared to for during  due to changes in the estimated fair value of a certain reporting unit resulting from a decrease in sales projections  along with continued underperformance in the operations of that reporting unit  we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million 
no impairment charges were recognized for interest expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for the interest expense incurred in both periods primarily relates to our million of senior subordinated notes 
net interest expense for was higher due to funds borrowed under our revolving credit facility to finance the acquisitions of ds brown and award metals along with a million charge to write off deferred financing fees in these expenses were partially offset by million of interest income earned on the million note held resulting from the sale of scm metal products in this note receivable was collected in full during november no amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facility during we recognized a provision for income taxes of million for  an effective tax rate of  compared with a provision for income taxes of million  an effective tax rate of for the effective tax rate for was reduced by percentage points from the rate largely due to lower non deductible expenses incurred during this reduction was partially offset by an increase of percentage points over due to the effect of intangible asset impairment charges  the majority of which was not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate for and exceeded the us federal statutory rate due to state taxes and non deductible permanent differences

our selling prices increased from the prior year as a result of the higher costs we paid for steel  aluminum  and resins which impacted the selling prices offered to our customers 
sales volume improved from the previous year as a result of repairs for spring storm damage and some improved macroeconomic conditions in the industrial construction markets which offset the uneven recovery in the new build housing and commercial construction markets 
our gross margin also increased to for compared to for the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to a better alignment of material costs with customer selling prices and the impact of our acquisitions which contributed sales of products with higher gross margins 
cost reductions  increased volume  and a million reduction in restructuring costs also contributed to our improved gross margin 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for the million increase was the net result of million of additional expense from acquired businesses  increased cost of variable incentive compensation from improved operating results  million of acquisition related costs  and a million charge recognized as a result of time based equity awards surrendered by gibraltar s chief executive officer partially offset by our cost reduction efforts that resulted in decreased spending on professional services  rent  and other operating expenses 
despite the increased costs  sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for compared to for due to changes in the estimated fair value of certain reporting units resulting from a significant decrease in sales projections  we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million for no impairment charges were recognized for interest expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for the reduction in interest expense was a result of incurring a million charge in related to an ineffective interest rate swap 
the reduction was offset by incurring a million charge to write off deferred financing fees in and having slightly higher levels of debt outstanding during compared to in the first quarter of  we repaid million of debt  which constituted all outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility 
subsequently  we borrowed funds under our revolving credit facility to finance the acquisitions of ds brown and award metals during the second quarter of which were repaid in full during the third quarter of 
table of contents we recognized a provision for income taxes of million for  an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for exceeded the us federal statutory tax rate of due to state taxes and the impact of non deductible permanent differences 
during  we recognized a tax benefit of million  an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate due to the effect of non deductible permanent differences  a large portion of which related to the intangible asset impairment charges that were not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  we recognized a million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in for certain state net operating loss carryforwards which further reduced the effective tax rate 
outlook for the first quarter of  we expect revenues to increase approximately primarily from incremental revenues of our most recent acquisitions 
we believe the continued recovery in the residential and non residential construction markets will provide stronger growth opportunities in the second half of we expect the first quarter gross margin to approximate as our cost reductions offset the margin impact of lower sales volume in a seasonally weak quarter 
for  we expect sg a expense to approximate million per quarter  or of full year revenue 
our expectations for other financial measures for our continuing operations  excluding refinancing charges  include net interest at a run rate of million per quarter  a full year effective tax rate of and capital expenditures of million for the year 
over the long term  we believe that the fundamentals of the building and industrial markets are positive and the aggressive actions taken to streamline and improve the efficiency of our business have reduced our break even point and positioned gibraltar to generate marked improvements in profitability when economic and market conditions return toward historical levels 
liquidity and capital resources general our principal capital requirements are to fund our operations with working capital  the purchase of capital improvements for our business and facilities  and to fund acquisitions 
we will continue to invest in growth opportunities as appropriate while continuing to focus on working capital efficiency and profit improvement opportunities to minimize the cash invested to grow our business 
we have successfully generated positive cash flows from operating activities during the past three years to fund our capital requirements and assist in the funding of our and acquisitions as noted below in the cash flows section of item of this annual report on form k 
we generated positive operating cash flows during these periods despite the continued challenging economic conditions our business faced 
in the future  we expect to continue profitable growth and sustain strong working capital management to continue to generate positive operating cash flow 
on october   we entered into the senior credit agreement which includes a million revolving credit facility and provides gibraltar with access to capital and improved financial flexibility 
as of december   our liquidity of million consisted of million of cash and million of availability under our revolving credit facility as compared to liquidity of million as of december  we believe that availability of funds under our senior credit agreement together with the cash generated from operations should be sufficient to provide the company with the liquidity and capital resources necessary to support our principal capital requirements during the next twelve months 
our senior credit agreement provides the company with liquidity and capital resources for use by our us operations 
historically  our foreign operations have generated cash flow from operations sufficient to invest in working capital and fund their capital improvements 
as of december   our foreign subsidiaries held million of cash 
we believe cash held by our foreign subsidiaries provides our foreign operations with the necessary liquidity to meet future obligations and allows the foreign business units to reinvest in their operations 
these cash resources could eventually be used to grow our business internationally through transactions similar to our acquisition of the western canadian bar grating business 
over the long term  we expect that future obligations  including strategic business opportunities such as acquisitions  may be financed through a number of sources  including internally available cash  availability under our revolving credit facility  new debt financing  the issuance of equity securities  or any combination of the above 
potential acquisitions are evaluated on the basis of our ability to enhance our existing products  operations  or capabilities  as well as provide access to new products  markets  and customers and improve shareholder value 
our acquisitions were funded by cash on hand  while the acquisitions of ds brown and award metals were financed through the use of cash on hand and debt available under our revolving credit facility

critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts selling  general  and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  which impacts our depreciation and amortization costs  the assessment of recoverability of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets  which impacts the impairment of long lived assets  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  which impacts the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities  which impact the provision for income taxes 
management reviews these estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves  on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experience  current conditions  and future expectations 
management believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents valuation of accounts receivable our accounts receivable represent those amounts that have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
as of december  and  allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million were recorded  respectively  or approximately of gross accounts receivable for both periods 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the portion of those accounts receivable that we believe are potentially uncollectible based on various factors  including experience  creditworthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
valuation of inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first in  first out basis using a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost 
on a regular basis  we calculate an estimated market value of our inventory  considered to be the prevailing selling price for the inventory less the cost to complete and sell the product 
we compare the current carrying value of our inventory to the estimated market value to determine whether a reserve to value inventory at the lower of cost or market is necessary 
we recorded insignificant charges during the three year period ended december  to value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
we recorded reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory of million and million as of december  and  respectively  or approximately of gross inventories for both periods 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory 
accounting for acquired assets and liabilities when we acquire a business  we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair values 
we record any premium over the fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price involves judgments and estimates both in characterizing the assets and in determining their fair value 
the way we characterize the assets has important implications  as long lived assets with definitive lives  for example  are depreciated or amortized  whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment  as explained below 
with respect to determining the fair value of assets  the most subjective estimates involve valuations of long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment as well as identified intangible assets 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
the fair values of long lived assets are determined using valuation techniques that use discounted cash flow methods  independent market appraisals  and other acceptable valuation techniques 
the following summarizes the amount of purchase price allocated to property  plant  and equipment  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill for the acquisitions completed in in millions initial purchase price property  plant  and equipment identified intangible assets goodwill other net assets due to the subjectivity inherent in determining the fair value of long lived assets and the significant number of acquisitions we have completed  we believe the allocation of purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities is a critical accounting policy 
impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment as of december  in millions property  plant  and equipment  net acquired intangibles with useful lives other assets 
table of contents impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by discounted cash flow method  an independent market appraisal of the asset  or another acceptable valuation technique 
we recognized impairment charges for property  plant  and equipment as a result of restructuring activities during the years ended december   and goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset balances of million and million as of december   respectively  are subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october and at interim dates when indicators of impairment are present 
indicators of impairment could include a significant long term adverse change in business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
during  we concluded that no indicators of impairment existed at interim dates and did not perform any interim impairment tests related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we tested goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of at the annual test date 
as a result of the october  impairment test  the company recognized an intangible asset impairment charge of million for the year ended december  no impairment charges were recognized for the year ended december  however  the company recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million for the year ended december  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our company constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
as of the october  impairment test  we identified ten reporting units in total  of which all have goodwill 
the number of reporting units declined from eleven to ten in the current year as we consolidated two reporting units due to restructuring activities that consolidated their operating activities 
the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the following table sets forth the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit tested for goodwill impairment and the percentage by which the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the october  goodwill impairment test in thousands reporting unit goodwill allocated to reporting unit before impairment charges percentage by which estimated fair value exceeds carrying value goodwill impairment charges goodwill allocated to reporting unit after impairment charges  n a  total the october  goodwill impairment test included significant assumptions 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units as a part of step one of the impairment test  we used two valuation techniques an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach included a discounted cash flow model relying on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts  terminal value  and the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount future cash flows 
the market approach consisted of applying an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple to the forecasted ebitda to be generated in and the market approach also relied on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts and the ebitda multiple selected from an analysis of peer companies 

table of contents the following table sets forth the compound annual revenue growth rate for the five year period used to forecast cash flows and the average operating margin for the forecasted periods compared to actual operating margins generated over the long term reporting unit compound annual revenue growth rate for forecasted periods operating margins for forecasted periods actual long term operating margins a b c a operating margins presented exclude restructuring charges incurred by each reporting unit 
b the operating margins presented only include operating results generated since the dates these reporting units were acquired by gibraltar 
the reporting unit has undergone significant consolidation and restructuring activities in the past five years as locations were acquired  sold  and reorganized 
some of the acquisitions made occurred during the economic downturn 
significant changes have been made to downsize locations  realign operations  and change distribution patterns in order to turn the unit profitable and spur future economic growth 
c this reporting unit was restructured in and to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of production 
operating margins have improved since the restructuring was completed 
as a result  we believe forecasted operating margins will continue to exceed prior results 
we analyzed third party forecasts of housing starts and other macroeconomic indicators that impact each reporting unit to provide a reasonable estimate of revenue growth in future periods 
our analysis of third party forecasts noted that housing starts were projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of from to we considered these forecasts in developing each reporting unit s growth rates over the next five years depending on the level of correlation between housing starts and net sales for each reporting unit 
the correlation between housing starts and net sales was based on an analysis of historical housing starts and our historical revenue 
we concluded that this approach provided a reasonable estimate of long term revenue growth and cash flows for each reporting unit 
operating margins used to estimate future cash flows were consistent with long term margins generated by the reporting units while they have been owned and operated by gibraltar as shown in the table above 
the reporting units where forecasted operating margins exceed long term operating margins generated by the reporting unit were for reporting units that were recently acquired and  therefore  the long term operating margins were more significantly impacted by the economic turmoil that began in or were more significantly impacted by the decline in the residential housing market 
additionally  we took strategic actions to consolidate facilities  reduce costs  and restructure these business units to become more profitable as the economy recovers 
these actions led to increased costs and lower operating margins in the short term 
based on our understanding of these reporting units and the actions taken by management to restructure the businesses for improved growth and profitability  we concluded that the long term cash flows forecasted for all of the company s reporting units were reasonable 
in addition to revenue growth and operating margin forecasts  the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit also uses assumptions for the amount of working capital needed to support each reporting unit 
we forecasted modest improvement in working capital management for future periods at each reporting unit based on past performance 
the company experienced a significant reduction in days of working capital from days for the year ended december  to days for the year ended december  we have been able to significantly improve our working capital management through lean initiatives  efficiency improvements  and facility consolidations 
we believe continued improvement in our ability to manage working capital will allow us to increase the cash flow generated from each reporting unit 

table of contents the terminal value of each reporting unit was based on a projected terminal year of forecasted cash flows in our discounted cash flow model 
we made an assumption that cash flows would grow each year thereafter in the north american markets  and each year thereafter in the european markets served by the company  based on our approximation of gross domestic product growth 
this assumption was based on a third party forecast of future economic growth over the long term 
the discounted cash flow model uses the wacc to discount cash flows in the forecasted period and to discount the terminal value to present value 
to determine the wacc  we used a standard valuation method  the capital asset pricing model  based on readily available and current market data of peer companies considered market participants 
acknowledging the risk inherent in each reporting units ability to achieve long term forecasted cash flows  in applying the income approach we increased the wacc of each reporting unit based upon each reporting unit s past operating performance and their relative ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows 
as a result of these analyses  we assigned a wacc between and for each reporting unit 
the ebitda multiple used in the market approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit was applied to the forecasted ebitda to be generated during and the market approach relies on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts and the ebitda multiple selected from an analysis of peer companies considered market participants 
the revenue growth rates and profit margins used in the market approach were the same projections used in the discounted cash flows model as described above 
the ebitda multiples were established by analyzing each peer companies total invested capital in proportion to ebitda derived from each peer companies most recently reported earnings 
similar to the wacc analysis  we assessed the risk of each reporting unit achieving its forecasts with consideration given to how each reporting unit has performed historically compared to forecasts 
as a result of these analyses  we assigned an ebitda multiple between and for ebitda forecasts and and for ebitda forecasts 
as noted above  we used two commonly accepted valuation techniques to estimate a fair value for each reporting unit 
the estimated fair value for each reporting unit was calculated using a weighted average between the calculated amounts determined under the income approach and the market approach 
we weighted the income approach more heavily as the technique uses a long term approach that considers the expected operating profit of each reporting unit during periods where housing starts and other macroeconomic indicators are nearer historical averages 
the market approach values the reporting units using and ebitda values which were forecasted using estimated housing starts of  and  respectively 
housing starts have historically approximated million each year 
we believe the income approach considers the expected recovery in the residential building market better than the market approach 
therefore  we concluded that the income approach more accurately estimated the fair value of the reporting units as it considers earnings potential during a longer term and does not use the short term perspective used by the market approach 
accordingly  we concluded that the market participants who execute transactions to sell or buy a business in the current economic environment would place greater emphasis on the income approach 
the following table sets forth the company s estimated fair value and carrying value for each reporting unit as of october  in thousands reporting unit estimated fair value carrying value corporate total net debt equity net book value total 
table of contents the corporate category includes unallocated corporate cash out flows 
unallocated corporate cash out flows include executive compensation and other administrative costs 
gibraltar has grown substantially through acquisitions and our strategy is to allow business unit management to operate the business units autonomous of corporate management 
for example  each business unit has its own accounting  marketing  purchasing  information technology  and executive functions 
as a result  we believe a market participant would not consider unallocated corporate cash flows when valuing each reporting unit and these cash flows have been properly excluded from the valuation of the reporting units 
step two of the impairment analysis involved estimating the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of each reporting unit to its assets and liabilities other than goodwill and comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the step two analysis relied on a number of significant assumptions to determine the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets  including intangible assets 
the fair value of intangible assets was determined using standard valuation methodologies including the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method 
these methods primarily employed the use of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the applicable intangible assets 
the future cash flows used to determine the fair vales of these intangible assets were derived from step one of the goodwill impairment analysis as described above 
the discount rate used in the valuation of intangible assets was derived from the wacc used in step one of the goodwill impairment analysis 
based on the analysis described above  we concluded the assumptions underlying step two of our impairment analysis were reasonable and appropriate 
in addition to the analyses described above  we performed a reconciliation of the total estimated fair values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of october  to support the reasonableness of the fair value estimates used in our goodwill impairment test 
the following calculation provides this reconciliation and the resulting control premium determined as of our october  impairment analysis in thousands estimated fair value estimated market capitalization estimated fair value of reporting units less net debt as of october  shares outstanding as of october  average stock price from october  to november  value of equity control premium during our annual goodwill impairment test for  the company identified one reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of fair value due to decreased revenue projections 
the company initiated step two of the goodwill impairment test which involved calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair value of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill  calculating an implied fair value of goodwill  and comparing the implied fair value to the carrying amount of goodwill 
as a result of step two of the goodwill impairment test  the company estimated that the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit was less than its carrying value by  which has been recorded as an impairment charge for the year ended december  the remaining reporting units all had fair values in excess of their carrying value 
the difference between the total carrying value of our reporting units and the estimated fair value of equity is the result of the negative future cash flows associated with our unallocated corporate net assets as described above 
although the book value of equity exceeds our market capitalization  we deemed the control premium as of the october  impairment analysis to be reasonable based upon recent comparable transactions to acquire the control of similar businesses in our industry 
accordingly  we concluded the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was reasonably estimated 
we test our intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  determined using a discounted cash flow model  with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value 
we recognized impairment charges for indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our october  and impairment tests 
no impairments charges were recognized as a result of the october  impairment test 
the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets are consistent with the assumptions employed in the determination of the fair values of our reporting units 

table of contents accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of permanent differences between income or loss reported for financial statement purposes and tax purposes  provisions for uncertain tax positions  state taxes  and income generated by international operations 
our effective tax rate was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
regarding deferred income tax assets  we maintained a valuation allowance of million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets  primarily consisting of state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowances are based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future operating results do not meet expectations  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
it is our policy to record estimated interest and penalties due to tax authorities as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
insignificant amounts of interest and penalties were recognized in the provision for income taxes for the years ended december   and the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities  based on the technical merits of each position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
as of december  and  the liability for uncertain income tax positions was million and million  respectively 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
related party transactions a member of our board of directors  gerald s 
lippes  is a partner in a law firm that provides legal services to gibraltar 
for the years ended december    and  the company incurred costs of million  million  and million  respectively  for legal services from this firm 
costs incurred increased significantly for as a result of additional legal services provided for the acquisitions completed in and our amendment of the senior credit agreement 
for  costs included fees for four acquisitions completed during the year 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  recorded in accounts payable for amounts due to this law firm 
another member of our board of directors  robert e 
sadler  jr  is a member of the board of directors of m t bank corporation  one of the ten participating lenders which have committed capital to our million revolving credit facility in our senior credit agreement 
all amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility were repaid in full as of december  no amounts were outstanding on the revolving credit facility in therefore  no principal or interest was paid to the lenders in borrowings under the senior credit agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus an additional margin of to  based on the amount of borrowings available to gibraltar 
the revolving credit facility also carries an annual facility fee of on the undrawn portion of the facility and fees on outstanding letters of credit which are payable quarterly 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update update  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
update states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative test 
gibraltar has elected not to perform the qualitative assessment and performed the full quantitative test as of october  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  competition  and raw materials pricing and availability 
in addition  the company is exposed to other financial market risks  primarily related to its long term debt and foreign operations 
raw material pricing risk we are subject to market risk exposure related to volatility in the price of steel  aluminum  and resins 
a significant amount of our cost of sales relates to material costs 
our business is heavily dependent on the price and supply of our raw materials 
our various products are fabricated from steel  primarily hot rolled and galvanized steel coils and bars  produced by mills and service centers 
many of our products are also fabricated from aluminum coils and resins 
the commodity market  which includes the steel  aluminum  and resin industries  is highly cyclical in nature  and commodity costs have been volatile in recent years and may remain volatile in the future 
commodity costs are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  the availability of raw materials  competition  labor costs  freight and transportation costs  production costs  import duties and other trade restrictions 
although we have the ability to purchase steel from a number of suppliers  a production cutback by one or more of our current suppliers could create challenges in meeting delivery schedules to our customers 
the prices we offer to our customers are also impacted by changes in commodity costs 
we manage the alignment of the cost of our raw materials and prices offered to customers and attempt to pass changes to raw material costs through to our customers 
to improve our management of commodity costs  we attempt to maintain lean inventory levels 
our investment in erp systems was made to increase our effectiveness in this process 
we do not enter into long term contracts for the purchase of raw materials and do not maintain inventory levels in excess of our production requirements 
however  from time to time  we may purchase raw materials in advance of commodity cost increases 
we rely on major suppliers for our supply of raw materials 
during  we purchased our raw materials from domestic and foreign suppliers in an effort to purchase the lowest cost material as possible 
we cannot accurately calculate the pre tax impact a one percent change in the commodity costs would have on our operating results as the change in commodity costs would both impact the cost to purchase materials and the selling prices we offer our customers 
the impact to our operating results would significantly depend on the competitive environment and the costs of other alternative building products  which could impact our ability to pass commodity costs to our customers 
interest rate risk to manage interest rate risk  gibraltar uses both fixed and variable interest rate debt 
we repaid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and no amounts remain outstanding as of december  as a result  fixed rate debt consisting of the company s senior subordinated notes was the only significant debt that remains outstanding at year end 
we believe we limited our exposure to interest rate risk as a result of repaying substantially all variable rate debt and the long term nature of our fixed rate debt 
however  the company will continue to monitor changes in its debt levels and access to capital ensuring interest rate risk is appropriately managed 
at december   our fixed rate debt consisted primarily of million  net of discount  of our notes 
the company s million of notes were issued in december at a discount to yield 
the notes were due december  
table of contents subsequent to december   the company issued million of senior subordinated notes notes due february  in connection with the issuance of the notes  on january  the company initiated a tender offer to purchase the outstanding million of senior subordinated notes due in simultaneously with the closing of the sale of the notes on january   the company purchased the tendered notes 
the notes that were not tendered and purchased were called for redemption 
in connection with the purchase and subsequent redemption  the company satisfied and discharged its obligations under the notes 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements of item for more information regarding the issuance of the notes and redemption of the notes 
our variable rate debt consists primarily of the revolving credit facility under the senior credit agreement  of which no amounts are outstanding as of december   and other debt 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable interest rate based upon the libor plus an additional margin 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have changed the interest expense by less than million 
foreign exchange risk gibraltar has foreign exchange risk in our international operations  primarily located in canada and europe  and through purchases from foreign vendors 
therefore  changes in the values of currencies of these countries affect our financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we accepted our exposure to exchange rate movements relative to gibraltar s international operations and do not hedge our foreign exchange risk exposures 
a change of in the value of all applicable foreign currencies would not have a material effect on our financial position and cash flows
