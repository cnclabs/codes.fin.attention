item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with evercore partners inc s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
key financial measures revenue total revenues reflect revenues from our investment banking and investment management business segments that include fees for services  transaction related client reimbursements plus other revenue 
net revenues reflect total revenues less interest expense related to repurchase agreements and the senior notes 
investment banking 
our investment banking business earns fees from our clients for providing advice on mergers  acquisitions  divestitures  leveraged buyouts  restructurings and similar corporate finance matters  and from underwriting and private placement activities  as well as commissions from our sales and trading activities 
the amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement 
in general  advisory fees are paid at the time we sign an engagement letter  during the course of the engagement or when an engagement is completed 
the majority of our investment banking revenue consists of advisory fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a transaction 
a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons  including failure of parties to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals  to secure necessary financing or to achieve necessary regulatory approvals 
in the case of bankruptcy engagements  fees are subject to approval of the court 
underwriting revenues are recognized when the offering has been deemed to be completed  placement fees are generally recognized at the time of the client s acceptance of capital or capital commitments and commissions are recorded on a trade date basis or  in the case of payments under commission sharing arrangements  on the date earned 
revenue trends in our advisory business generally are correlated to the volume of m a activity and or restructuring activity  which tends to be counter cyclical to m a 
however  deviations from this trend can occur in any given year or quarter for a number of reasons 
for example  changes in our market share or the ability of our clients to close certain large transactions can cause our revenue results to diverge from the level of overall m a or restructuring activity 
investment management 
our investment management business includes operations related to the management of the institutional asset management  wealth management and private equity businesses 
revenue sources primarily include management fees  which include fees earned from portfolio companies  fiduciary and consulting fees  performance fees including carried interest and gains or losses on our investments 
management fees for third party clients generally represent a percentage of aum 
fiduciary and consulting fees  which are generally a function of the size and complexity of each engagement  are individually negotiated 
management fees from private equity operations are generally a percentage of committed capital or invested capital at rates agreed with the investment funds we manage or with the individual client 
performance fees from private equity funds are earned when specified benchmarks are exceeded 
in certain circumstances  such fees are subject to claw back provisions 
portfolio company fees include monitoring  director and transaction fees associated with services provided to the portfolio companies of the private equity funds we manage 
gains and losses include both realized and unrealized gains and losses on principal investments  including those arising from our equity interest in investment partnerships 
transaction related client reimbursements 
in both our investment banking and investment management segments  we make various transaction related expenditures  such as travel and professional fees  on behalf of our clients 
pursuant to the engagement letters with our advisory clients or the contracts with the limited partners in the private equity funds we manage  these expenditures may be reimbursable 
we define these expenses as 
table of contents transaction related expenses and record such expenditures as incurred and record revenue when it is determined that clients have an obligation to reimburse us for such transaction related expenses 
client expense reimbursements are recorded as revenue on the consolidated statements of operations on the later of the date an engagement letter is executed or the date we pay or accrue the expense 
other revenue and interest expense 
other revenue and interest expense is derived primarily from investing customer funds in financing transactions 
these transactions are principally repurchases and resales of mexican government and government agency securities 
revenue and expenses associated with these transactions are recognized over the term of the repurchase or resale transaction 
other revenue includes income earned on marketable securities  cash and cash equivalents and assets segregated for regulatory purposes 
interest expense includes interest expense associated with the senior notes 
operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense 
we include all payments for services rendered by our employees  as well as profits interests in our businesses that have been accounted for as compensation  in employee compensation and benefits expense 
we maintain compensation programs  including base salary  cash  deferred cash and equity bonus awards and benefits programs and manage compensation to estimates of competitive levels based on market conditions and performance 
our level of compensation reflects our plan to maintain competitive compensation levels to retain key personnel  and it reflects the impact of newly hired senior professionals  including related grants of equity awards which are generally valued at their grant date 
increasing the number of high caliber  experienced senior level employees is critical to our growth efforts 
in our advisory businesses  these hires generally do not begin to generate significant revenue in the year they are hired 
our annual compensation program includes share based compensation awards and deferred cash awards as a component of the annual bonus awards for certain employees 
these awards are generally subject to annual vesting requirements over a four year period beginning at the date of grant  which occurs in the first quarter of each year  accordingly  the expense is generally amortized over the stated vesting period 
with respect to the annual awards granted in february and thereafter  the company adopted new retirement eligibility criteria  which stipulates that if an employee has at least five years of continuous service  is at least years of age and has a combined age and years of service of at least years  the employee is eligible for retirement prior year s awards required combined years of service and age of at least years 
retirement eligibility allows for continued vesting of awards after employees depart from the company  provided they give the minimum advance notice  which is generally one year 
as a consequence of these changes  a greater number of employees will become retirement eligible and the related requisite service period over which we will expense these awards will be shorter than the stated vesting period 
non compensation expenses 
the balance of our operating expenses includes costs for occupancy and equipment rental  professional fees  travel and related expenses  communications and information technology services  depreciation and amortization  acquisition and transition costs and other operating expenses 
we refer to all of these expenses as non compensation expenses 

table of contents other expenses other expenses include a amortization costs associated with the modification and vesting of lp units and certain other awards  b charges associated with the vesting of event based awards  c the amortization of intangible assets associated with certain acquisitions  d compensation charges associated with deferred consideration  retention awards and related compensation for lexicon employees and e special charges related to the lexicon acquisition  including the exiting of facilities for office space in the uk  an introducing fee as well as other professional fees incurred by lexicon 
income from equity method investments our share of the income loss from our equity interests in g  abs and pan are included within income loss from equity method investments  as a component of income before income taxes  on the consolidated statements of operations 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes asc  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
discontinued operations in october  eam announced its plan to wind down its business 
eam s management and the company made this decision because eam was unable to attain sufficient scale to be a viable business due to several factors  including the ongoing effects of the financial crisis 
the wind down of eam s business was completed by december  accordingly  the historical results of eam have been included within discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
noncontrolling interest we record noncontrolling interest relating to the ownership interests of our current and former senior managing directors  their estate planning vehicles and trilantic in evercore lp  as well as the portions of our operating subsidiaries not owned by evercore 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements herein  evercore partners inc is the sole general partner of evercore lp and has a majority economic interest in evercore lp 
as a result  evercore partners inc consolidates evercore lp and records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in evercore lp held by the limited partners 
we generally allocate net income or loss to noncontrolling interests held at evercore lp and at the operating entity level  where required  by multiplying the vested equity ownership percentage of the noncontrolling interest holders for the period by the net income or loss of the entity to which the noncontrolling interest relates 
in circumstances where the governing documents of the entity to which the noncontrolling interest relates require special allocations of profits or losses to the controlling and noncontrolling interest holders  then the net income or loss of these entities will be allocated based on these special allocations

impairment of assets at november   in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values  with the exception of our institutional asset management reporting unit  which exceeded its carrying value by 
the amount of goodwill allocated to the institutional asset management reporting unit was million as of november   of which a portion is related to noncontrolling interest 
in determining the fair value of this reporting unit  we utilized both a market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow methodology based on the adjusted cash flows from operations 
the market multiple approach included applying the average earnings multiples of comparable public companies  multiplied by the forecasted earnings of the reporting unit  to yield an estimate of fair value 
the discounted cash flow methodology began with the forecasted cash flows of the reporting unit and applied a discount rate of  which reflected the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
the 
table of contents forecast inherent in the valuation assumes a stabilization of aum by the end of  with aum beginning to increase in the first half of and  over the longer term  assumes a compound annual growth rate in revenues of from the trailing twelve month period ended november  we used our best judgment and the information available to us at the time to perform this valuation 
because assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  actual results could differ 
we estimate that an assumed decrease in forecasted aum and related revenue throughout the entire forecasted period  would result in the fair value of the institutional asset management reporting unit to be below its book value 
deterioration in these assumptions  including a period of sustained decline in the equity markets  would cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline  which may result in an impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill 
if a charge for impairment of goodwill in the institutional asset management reporting unit were required in a future period  it would be allocated  in part  to noncontrolling interest 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we determined that our institutional asset management operating segment met the criteria for a step impairment assessment as required by asc and asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  for the client related intangible assets of atalanta sosnoff and the goodwill for its institutional asset management reporting unit as of june  as of june   we concluded that the fair value of our institutional asset management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible assets exceeded their carrying amount

follow on offering of class a common stock during  we completed an offering of  shares of class a common stock 
net proceeds in conjunction with this issuance were million 
a portion of the proceeds from the offering were used to purchase from certain holders  including members of the company s senior management  a number of outstanding lp units 
the company used a portion of the remaining proceeds to fund the initial cash payments associated with the acquisition of lexicon 
in addition  lp units held by members of evercore lp members may be exchanged in the future for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis  subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits  stock dividends and reclassifications 
the above exchanges and any such future exchanges are expected to result in an increase in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of evercore lp 
these increases in tax basis increase for tax purposes amortization and  therefore  reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay 
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the members that provides for the payment by us to an exchanging member of of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis 
we expect to benefit from the remaining of cash savings  if any  in income tax that we realize 
while the actual amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of exchanges  the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income  we expect that  as a result of the size of the increases of the tangible and intangible assets of evercore lp attributable to our interest in evercore lp  during the expected term of the tax receivable agreement  the payments that we may make to our members are expected to be substantial 
the effect of the tax receivable agreement on our consolidated statement of financial condition as a result of the above exchanges was an increase of million related to the offering in deferred tax assets for the 
table of contents estimated income tax effects of the increase in the tax basis of the assets owned by evercore lp  based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the dates of the transactions 
to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset  based on an analysis of expected future earnings  we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance 
we also recorded of the estimated realizable tax benefit which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance as an increase of million related to the offering between amounts due pursuant to tax receivable agreements and payable to employees and related parties 
we recorded the remaining of the estimated realizable tax benefit  or million as an increase to additional paid in capital 
the amounts that were recorded for both the deferred tax asset and the liability for our obligations under the tax receivable agreement have been estimated 
any additional payments under the tax receivable agreement that will further increase the tax benefits and the estimated payments under the tax receivable agreement have not been included in the estimates 
all of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the dates of the exchanges will be included in net income 
similarly  the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income 
future exchanges of lp units for our shares of class a common stock will be accounted for in a similar manner 
cash flows our operating cash flows are primarily influenced by the timing and receipt of investment banking and investment management fees  and the payment of operating expenses  including bonuses to our employees and interest expense on our senior notes 
investment banking advisory fees are generally collected within days of billing 
however  placement fees may be collected within days of billing 
management fees from our private equity investment management activities are generally billed in advance but collected at the end of a half year period from billing 
fees from our wealth management and institutional asset management businesses are generally billed and collected within days 
we traditionally pay a substantial portion of incentive compensation to personnel in the investment banking business and to executive officers during the first three months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results 
our investing and financing cash flows are primarily influenced by activities to deploy capital to fund investments and acquisitions  raise capital through the issuance of stock or debt  repurchase of outstanding class a shares  payment of dividends and other periodic distributions to our stakeholders 
we generally make dividend payments and other distributions on a quarterly basis

cash distributions related to partnership tax allocations are made to the partners of evercore lp in accordance with our corporate estimated payment calendar  these payments are made prior to the end of each calendar quarter 
in addition  dividends on class a shares are paid when and if declared by the board of directors  which is generally quarterly 
we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including cash  other significant working capital  current assets and liabilities  long term liabilities  lease commitments and related fixed assets  principal investment commitments related to our investment management business  dividends on class a shares  partnership distributions and other matters relating to liquidity and compliance with regulatory requirements 
our liquidity is highly dependent on our revenue stream from our operations  principally from our investment banking business  which is a function of closing transactions and earning success fees  the timing and realization of which is irregular and dependent upon factors that are not subject to our control 
our revenue stream funds the payment of our expenses  including annual bonus payments  a portion of which are guaranteed  interest expense on our senior notes and income taxes 
payments made for income taxes may be reduced by deductions taken for the increase in tax basis of our investment in evercore lp 
these tax deductions  when realized  require payment under our long term liability  amounts due pursuant to tax receivable agreements 
we intend to fund these payments from cash and cash equivalents on hand  principally derived from cash flows from operations 
these tax deductions  when realized  will result in cash otherwise required to satisfy tax obligations becoming available 
table of contents for other purposes 
our management committee meets regularly to monitor our liquidity and cash positions against our short and long term obligations  as well as our capital requirements and commitments 
the result of this review contributes to management s recommendation to the board of directors as to the level of quarterly dividend payments  if any 
as a financial services firm  our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world 
revenue generated by our advisory activities is related to the number and value of the transactions in which we are involved 
during periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions  the number and value of m a transactions generally decrease  and they generally increase during periods of favorable market or economic conditions 
restructuring activity generally is counter cyclical to m a activity 
in addition  during periods of unfavorable market conditions our investment management business may be impacted by reduced equity valuations and generate relatively lower revenue because fees we receive typically are in part based on the market value of underlying publicly traded securities 
our profitability may also be adversely affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame and in an amount sufficient to match any decreases in revenue relating to changes in market and economic conditions 
reduced equity valuations resulting from future adverse economic events and or market conditions may impact our performance and may result in future net redemptions of aum from our clients  which would generally result in the lower revenues and cash flows 
for a further discussion of risks related to our business  refer to risk factors elsewhere in this form k 
we periodically repurchase class a shares and or lp units into treasury in order to reduce the dilutive effect of equity awards granted 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million class a shares and or lp units for up to million 
under this share repurchase program  shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
the timing and the actual amount of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors  including legal requirements  price and economic and market conditions 
this program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date 
during  we repurchased  shares for million pursuant to this program 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million class a shares and or lp units for up to million 
under this share repurchase program  shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
the timing and the actual amount of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors  including legal requirements  price and economic and market conditions 
this program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date 
in addition  periodically  we purchase lp units in conjunction with follow on offerings and we buy shares into treasury from our employees in order to allow them to satisfy their minimum tax requirements for share deliveries under our share equity plan 
see follow on offering of class a common stock above 
during  we repurchased  shares for million primarily related to minimum tax withholding requirements of share deliveries 
on august   we entered into a purchase agreement with mizuho pursuant to which mizuho purchased from us million principal amount of senior notes and warrants to purchase  class a shares at per share expiring in the holder of the senior notes may require us to purchase  for cash  all or any portion of the holder s senior notes upon a change of control of the company for a price equal to the accreted amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
senior notes held by mizuho will be redeemable at the accreted amount at our option at any time within days following the date on which mizuho notifies us that it is terminating their strategic alliance agreement 
senior notes held by any holder other than mizuho will be redeemable at the accreted amount plus accrued and unpaid interest at our option at any time 
in the event of a 
table of contents default under the indenture  the trustee or holders of of the senior notes may declare that the accreted amount is immediately due and payable 
pursuant to the agreement  mizuho may transfer a the senior notes i with the company s consent  ii to a permitted transferee  or iii to the extent that such transfer does not result in any holder or group of affiliated holders directly or indirectly owning more than of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes  and b the warrants i with the company s consent  ii to a permitted transferee  iii pursuant to a tender or exchange offer  or a merger or sale transaction involving the company that has been recommended by the company s board of directors  or iv to the extent that such transfer is made pursuant to a widely distributed public offering or does not result in any holder or group of affiliated holders directly or indirectly owning more than of the company s voting securities and the total shares of class a common stock transferred  together with any shares of shares of class a common stock on an as converted basis transferred during the preceding months  is less than of the company s outstanding class a common stock 
the company has a right of first offer on any proposed transfer by mizuho of the warrants  common stock purchased in the open market or acquired by exercise of the warrants and associated common stock issued as dividends 
the exercise price for the warrants is payable  at the option of the holder of the warrants  either in cash or by tender of senior notes at the accreted amount  at any point in time 
pursuant to the purchase agreement with mizuho  evercore is subject to certain nonfinancial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
we have made certain capital commitments  with respect to our investment activities  as well as commitments related to redeemable noncontrolling interest and contingent consideration from our acquisitions  which are included in the contractual obligations section below 
ecb maintains a line of credit with bbva bancomer to fund its trading activities on an intra day and overnight basis 
the intra day facility is approximately million and is secured with trading securities when used on an overnight basis 
no interest is charged on the intra day facility 
the overnight facility is charged the inter bank balance interest rate plus basis points and is secured with trading securities 
there have been no significant draw downs on ecb s line of credit since august  the line of credit is renewable annually 
pursuant to deferred compensation and deferred consideration arrangements  we are obligated to make cash payments in future periods 
for further information see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our subsidiaries are regulated entities and are subject to capital requirements

collateralized financing activity at ecb ecb enters into repurchase agreements with clients seeking overnight money market returns whereby ecb transfers to the clients mexican government securities in exchange for cash and concurrently agrees to repurchase the securities at a future date for an amount equal to the cash exchanged plus a stipulated premium or interest factor 
ecb deploys the cash received from  and acquires the securities deliverable to  clients under these repurchase arrangements by purchasing securities in the open market or by entering into reverse repurchase agreements with unrelated third parties 
we account for these repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing transactions 
we record a liability on our consolidated statements of financial condition in relation to repurchase transactions executed with clients as securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
we record as assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition  financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value where we have acquired the securities deliverable to clients under these repurchase arrangements by purchasing securities in the open market and securities purchased under agreements to resell where we have acquired the securities deliverable to clients under these repurchase 
table of contents agreements by entering into reverse repurchase agreements with unrelated third parties 
these mexican government securities included in financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition have an estimated average time to maturity of approximately years  as of december   and are pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements  which are collateralized financing agreements 
generally  collateral is posted equal to the contract value at inception and is subject to market changes 
these repurchase agreements are primarily with institutional customer accounts managed by ecb  generally mature within one business day and permit the counterparty to pledge the securities 
increases and decreases in asset and liability levels related to these transactions are a function of growth in ecb s aum  as well as clients investment allocations requiring positioning in repurchase transactions 
ecb has procedures in place to monitor the daily risk limits for positions taken  as well as the credit risk based on the collateral pledged under these agreements against their contract value from inception to maturity date 
the daily risk measure is value at risk var  which is a statistical measure  at a confidence level  of the potential daily losses from adverse market movements in an ordinary market environment based on a historical simulation using the prior year s historical data 
ecb s risk management committee the committee has established a policy to maintain var at levels below of the value of the portfolio 
if at any point in time the threshold is exceeded  ecb personnel are alerted by an automated interface with ecb s trading systems and begin to make adjustments in the portfolio in order to mitigate the risk and bring the portfolio in compliance 
concurrently  ecb personnel must notify the risk management committee of the variance and the actions taken to reduce the exposure to loss 
in addition to monitoring var  ecb periodically performs discrete stress tests stress tests to assure that the level of potential losses that would arise from extreme market movements that may not be anticipated by var measures are within acceptable levels 
the table below includes a key stress test monitored by the committee  noted as the sensitivity to a basis point change in interest rates 
this analysis assists ecb in understanding the impact of an extreme move in rates  assuring the collateralized financing portfolio is structured to maintain risk at an acceptable level  even in extreme circumstances 
the committee meets monthly to analyze the overall market risk exposure based on positions taken  as well as the credit risk  based on the collateral pledged under these agreements against the contract value from inception to maturity date 
in these meetings the committee evaluates risk from an operating perspective  var  and an exceptional perspective  stress tests  to determine the appropriate level of risk limits in the current environment 
we periodically assess the collectability or credit quality related to securities purchased under agreements to resell 

table of contents as of december  and  a summary of ecb s assets  liabilities and risk measures related to its collateralized financing activities is as follows december  december  amount market value of collateral received or pledged amount market value of collateral received or pledged dollars in thousands assets financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value securities purchased under agreements to resell total assets liabilities securities sold under agreements to repurchase net liabilities risk measures value at risk stress test portfolio sensitivity to a basis point increase in the interest rate portfolio sensitivity to a basis point decrease in the interest rate contractual obligations the following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands operating lease obligations tax receivable agreements notes payable  including interest investment banking commitments investment management commitments total as of december   we were unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority  hence  per asc  unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above commitments and contractual obligations 
we had total commitments not reflected on our consolidated statements of financial condition relating to future capital contributions to the private equity funds of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations 
we may be required to fund these commitments at any time through june  depending on the timing and level of investments by our private equity funds 

table of contents we also have commitments related to our redeemable noncontrolling interests 
the value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests  which principally includes noncontrolling interests held by the principals of ewm  atalanta sosnoff and trilantic  increased from million as of december  to million as of december   as recorded on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the value of ewm s equity after our acquisition of mt 
eden  as well as the expiration of key man insurance policies 
see note for further information 
see note for our commitments related to the contingent consideration for acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity  capital resources  market or credit risk support  or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
market risk and credit risk we  in general  are not a capital intensive organization and as such  are not subject to significant market or credit risks 
nevertheless  we have established procedures to assess both the market and credit risk  as well as specific investment risk  exchange rate risk and credit risk related to receivables 
market and investment risk institutional asset management we invest in funds managed by ewm and g these funds principally hold readily marketable investment securities 
as of december   the fair value of our investments with these products  based on closing prices  was million 
we estimate that a hypothetical adverse change in the market value of the investments would have resulted in a decrease in pre tax income of approximately million for the year ended december  see liquidity and capital resources above for a discussion of collateralized financing transactions at ecb 
private equity funds through our principal investments in our private equity funds and our ability to earn carried interest from these funds  we face exposure to changes in the estimated fair value of the companies in which these funds invest 
our professionals devote considerable time and resources to work closely with the portfolio company s management to assist in designing a business strategy  allocating capital and other resources and evaluating expansion or acquisition opportunities 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a comprehensive analysis and valuation of all of the portfolio companies 
our analysis includes reviewing the current market conditions and valuations of each portfolio company 
valuations and analysis regarding our investments in csi capital and trilantic are performed by their respective professionals  and thus we are not involved in determining the fair value for the portfolio companies of such funds 
we estimate that a hypothetical adverse change in the value of the private equity funds would have resulted in a decrease in pre tax income of approximately million for the year ended december  exchange rate risk we have foreign operations  through our subsidiaries and affiliates  in mexico  the united kingdom  brazil  canada and hong kong which creates foreign exchange rate risk 
their respective functional currencies are the 
table of contents mexican peso  british pound sterling  brazilian real  canadian dollar and hong kong dollar 
we have not entered into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign exchange fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or otherwise 
an appreciation or depreciation of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar would result in an adverse or beneficial impact to our financial results 
a significant portion of our latin american revenues have been  and will continue to be  derived from contracts denominated in mexican pesos and evercore europe s revenue and expenses are denominated primarily in british pounds sterling and euro 
historically  the value of these foreign currencies has fluctuated relative to the us dollar 
for the year ended december   the net impact of the fluctuation of foreign currencies recorded in other comprehensive income within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income was million 
it is currently not our intention to hedge our foreign currency exposure  and we will reevaluate this policy from time to time 
credit risks we maintain cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings 
at times  we may maintain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured fdic limits 
however  we believe that we are not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institution in which those deposits are held 
accounts receivable consists primarily of advisory fees and expense reimbursements billed to our clients 
receivables are reported net of any allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for bad debts to provide coverage for probable losses from our customer receivables and derive the estimate through specific identification for the allowance for doubtful accounts and an assessment of the client s creditworthiness 
as of december  and  total receivables amounted to million and million  respectively  net of an allowance 
the investment banking and investment management receivables collection periods generally are within days of invoice  with the exception of placement fees  which are generally collected within days of invoice 
the collection period for restructuring transactions and private equity fee receivables may exceed days 
we recorded minimal bad debt expense for each of the years ended december  and with respect to our marketable securities portfolio  which is comprised primarily of highly rated corporate and municipal bonds  mutual funds and seed capital investments  we manage our credit risk exposure by limiting concentration risk and maintaining investment grade credit quality 
as of december   we had marketable securities of million  of which were corporate and municipal securities  primarily with s p ratings ranging from aaa to bb  and were seed capital investments and mutual funds 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in conformity with us gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their notes  including reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition investment banking revenue we earn investment banking fees from our clients for providing advisory services on mergers  acquisitions  divestitures  leveraged buyouts  restructurings and similar corporate finance matters 
it is our accounting policy to recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client  ii fees are fixed or 
table of contents determinable  iii the agreed upon services have been completed and delivered to the client or the transaction or events contemplated in the engagement letter are determined to be substantially completed and iv collection is reasonably assured 
we record investment banking revenue on the consolidated statements of operations for the following in general  advisory fees are paid at the time we sign an engagement letter  during the course of the engagement or when an engagement is completed 
in some circumstances  and as a function of the terms of an engagement letter  we may receive retainer fees for financial advisory services concurrent with  or soon after  the execution of the engagement letter where the engagement letter will specify a future service period associated with that fee 
in such circumstances  these retainer fees are initially recorded as deferred revenue  which is recorded within other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition  and subsequently recognized as revenue during the applicable time period within which the service is rendered 
revenues related to fairness or valuation opinions are recognized when the opinion has been rendered and delivered to the client and all other requirements for revenue recognition are satisfied 
success fees for advisory services  such as m a advice  are recognized when the transaction s or event s are determined to be completed or substantially completed and all other requirements for revenue recognition are satisfied 
in the event the company were to receive an opinion or success fee in advance of the completion conditions noted above  such fee would initially be recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized as advisory fee revenue when the conditions of completion have been satisfied 
placement fee revenues are attributable to capital raising 
we recognize placement advisory fees at the time of the client s acceptance of capital or capital commitments in accordance with the terms of the engagement letter 
underwriting revenues are attributable to public and private offerings of equity and debt securities and are recognized when the offering has been deemed to be completed by the lead manager of the underwriting group  pursuant to applicable sec and finra rules 
when the offering is completed  we recognize the applicable management fee  selling concession and underwriting fee  the latter net of estimated offering expenses 
commissions received from customers on agency based brokerage transactions in listed and over the counter equities are recorded on a trade date basis or  in the case of payments under commission sharing arrangements  when earned 
investment management revenue our investment management business generates revenues from the management of client assets and the private equity funds 
investment management fees generated for third party clients are generally based on the value of the aum and any performance fees that may be negotiated with the client 
these fees are generally recognized over the period that the related services are provided  based upon the beginning  ending or average value of the assets for the relevant period 
fees paid in advance of services rendered are initially recorded as deferred revenue  which is recorded in other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition  and is recognized in investment management revenue on the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the period in which the related service is rendered 
generally  to the extent performance fee arrangements have been negotiated  these fees are earned when the return on assets exceeds certain benchmark returns 
performance fees are accrued on a monthly basis and are not subject to adjustment once the measurement period ends annually and performance fees have been realized 
management fees for private equity funds are contractual and are typically based on committed capital during the private equity funds investment period  and on invested capital thereafter 
management fees are recognized ratably over the period during which services are provided 
we also record performance fee revenue 
table of contents from the private equity funds when the returns on the private equity funds investments exceed certain threshold minimums 
these performance fees  or carried interest  are computed in accordance with the underlying private equity funds partnership agreements and are based on investment performance over the life of each investment partnership 
performance fees are recorded as revenue as earned pursuant to the client agreements 
fees for serving as an independent fiduciary and or trustee are either based on a flat fee or are based on the value of assets under administration 
for ongoing engagements  fees are billed quarterly either in advance or in arrears 
fees paid in advance of services rendered are initially recorded as deferred revenue in other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition  and are recognized in investment management revenue on the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the period in which the related services are rendered 
net interest revenue is derived from investing customer funds in financing transactions 
these transactions are primarily repurchases and resales of mexican government securities 
revenue and expenses associated with these transactions are recognized over the term of the repurchase or resale transaction 
valuation the valuation of our investments in securities and of our financial investments in the funds we manage impacts both the carrying value of direct investments and the determination of management and performance fees  including carried interest 
effective january   we adopted asc  which among other things requires enhanced disclosures about financial instruments carried at fair value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
level i investments include financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral and readily marketable equity securities 
level ii investments include our investments in corporate and municipal bonds and other debt securities 
we did not have any level iii investments as of december  we adopted asc  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities the option to measure most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates and to report related unrealized gains and losses in earnings 
we have not elected to apply the fair value option to any specific financial assets or liabilities 
certain of our commitments related to our redeemable noncontrolling interests  included within redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statements of financial condition  are initially recorded at fair value and may be subject to periodic adjustment to reflect changes in the estimate of the amount due 
marketable securities investments in corporate and municipal bonds and other debt securities are accounted for as available for sale under asc  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as net increases or decreases to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  while realized gains and losses on these securities are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other revenue on the consolidated statements of operations 
we invest in readily marketable debt and equity securities which are managed by ewm and g these securities are valued using quoted market prices on applicable exchanges or markets 
the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in the consolidated statements of operations in investment management revenue 
marketable securities also include investments in municipal bonds and mutual funds  which are carried at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in other revenue on the consolidated statements of operations 
marketable securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date 

table of contents financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value our financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value consist principally of foreign government obligations  which are recorded on a trade date basis and are stated at quoted market values 
related gains and losses are reflected in other revenue on the consolidated statements of operations 
we pledge our financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value to collateralize certain financing arrangements which permits the counterparty to pledge the securities 
equity compensation share based payments we account for share based payments in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc  compensation stock compensation 
we grant employees event based awards and performance based awards that vest upon the occurrence of certain events or performance criteria being achieved 
compensation cost is accrued if it is probable that the event or performance condition will be achieved and is not accrued if it is not probable that the event or performance condition will be achieved 
significant judgment is required in determining the probability an event s occurrence or that the performance criteria will be achieved 
the fair value of awards that vest from one to five years are amortized over the vesting period or requisite substantive service period  as required by asc see note to the consolidated financial statements herein for further information 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing book versus tax treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains and losses on long term investments and depreciation 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the level of historical taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred taxes  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented by us in making this assessment 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in order to determine the quarterly tax rate  we are required to estimate full year pre tax income and the related annual income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect our overall effective tax rate 
furthermore  our interpretation of complex tax laws may impact our measurement of current and deferred income taxes 
asc provides a benefit recognition model with a two step approach consisting of more likely than not recognition criteria  and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this standard also requires the recognition of liabilities created by differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements herein in regard to the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the deferred tax assets relate to the us operations of the company 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the amount of the company s historic and projected future taxable 
table of contents income for its us and foreign operations 
in and  we performed an assessment of the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets and determined that the company should have sufficient future taxable income in the normal course of business to fully realize the portion of the deferred tax assets associated with its us operations and management has concluded that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
prior to the company concluded that the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries required a full valuation allowance as it was not more likely than not to be recoverable 
during  sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the entire valuation allowance on those foreign subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements herein for further information 
the company estimates that evercore partners inc must generate approximately million of future taxable income to realize the us deferred tax asset balance of approximately million 
the deferred tax balance is expected to reverse over a period ranging of to taxable years 
the company evaluated evercore partners inc s historical us taxable income  which has averaged approximately million per year  as well as the current anticipated profitability of approximately million and taxable income in the future  which indicates sufficient taxable income to support the realization of these deferred tax assets 
to the extent enough taxable income is not generated in the year estimated reversal period  the company will have an additional years to utilize any net operating loss carry forwards created  as well as the relevant net operating loss carry back period in effect at the time of a taxable loss 
during  the company experienced significant favorable developments in its foreign subsidiaries  including sustained profitability and projections of sufficient future taxable income 
these  together with the projected emergence from cumulative losses and the anticipated utilization of net operating losses in the impacted foreign subsidiaries during  represent significant positive evidence 
as of december   the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the historical negative evidence regarding the likelihood that the deferred tax asset for the company s impacted foreign subsidiaries will be realized 
this assessment was evidenced by the company meeting all of the criteria in its framework  resulting in its conclusion that the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets for certain foreign subsidiaries should be released in impairment of assets in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment annually  as of november th  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
in this process  we make estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of our reporting units and to project future earnings using valuation techniques 
we use our best judgment and information available to us at the time to perform this review 
because our assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  actual results could differ 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable as prescribed by asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
in determining the fair value for each reporting unit  we utilize either a market multiple approach or a discounted cash flow methodology based on the adjusted cash flows from operations 
the market multiple approach includes applying the average earnings multiples of comparable public companies for their respective reporting segment multiplied by the forecasted earnings of the respective reporting unit to yield an estimate of fair value 
the discounted cash flow methodology begins with the adjusted cash flows from each of the reporting units and uses a discount rate that reflects the weighted average costs of capital adjusted for the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
as of november   we concluded that the fair value of our institutional asset management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by  and the fair values of our other reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
as of november   we concluded the fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values for all of our reporting units 
for further information see impairment of assets in results of operations
