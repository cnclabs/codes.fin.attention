the company s facilities enable the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates determined  in part  by the company s credit ratings and contain various covenants  including a maximum net debt to capital ratio 
at december   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements 
the non performance of any financial institution supporting either of the credit facilities would reduce the maximum capacity of these facilities by each institution s respective commitment 
in january  baxter entered into an agreement related to a day bridge loan facility with a maximum capacity of billion in connection with the planned acquisition of gambro 
the terms of the bridge loan facility are substantially similar to the terms of the company s primary revolving credit facility 
the company intends to finance the transaction with off shore cash and the issuance of at least billion of debt 
the company does not anticipate utilizing the bridge loan facility 
the company also maintains other credit arrangements  as described in note access to capital the company intends to fund short term and long term obligations as they mature through cash on hand  future cash flows from operations or by issuing additional debt

the company plans to issue at least billion of debt during the first half of to fund the planned acquisition of gambro  which will significantly increase the company s outstanding debt 
the company s ability to generate cash flows from operations  issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers  deterioration in the company s key financial ratios or credit ratings or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions 
however  the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt  enter into other financing arrangements and attract long term capital on acceptable terms to support the company s growth objectives 

table of contents the company continues to do business with foreign governments in certain countries  including greece  spain  portugal and italy  that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions 
as of december   the company s net accounts receivable from the public sector in greece  spain  portugal and italy totaled million of which million related to greece 
the company s net accounts receivable from the public sector for the countries identified above decreased by million during primarily as a result of the collection of certain past due receivables in spain 
while the economic downturn has not significantly impacted the company s ability to collect receivables  global economic conditions and liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted  and may continue to result  in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses 
with respect to the greek government bonds  the company collected million in december upon the maturity of the first tranche of the bonds 
however  as a result of continued economic uncertainty and ongoing greek government negotiations regarding the settlement terms for outstanding bonds  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in to reduce the remaining greek government bonds held by the company to estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of these bonds was calculated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporated observable inputs  including interest rate yields 
in march  the company s greek government debt holdings were restructured into new greek government bonds with a notional amount of million ranging in maturity from to years  and european financial stability facility efsf bonds with a notional amount of million maturing in one to two years

credit ratings the company s credit ratings at december  were as follows 
standard poor s fitch moody s ratings senior debt a a a short term debt a f p outlook stable negative negative in  standard poor s downgraded the company s senior debt ratings by one notch from a to a  and both fitch and moody s changed their outlook from stable to negative 
these downgrades were a result of the company s december announcement of the proposed acquisition of gambro and the plans to fund the acquisition with at least billion of debt  which would significantly increase the company s debt level 
if baxter s credit ratings or outlooks were to be further downgraded  the company s financing costs related to its credit arrangements and any future debt issuances could be unfavorably impacted 
however  any future credit rating downgrade or change in outlook would not affect the company s ability to draw on its credit facilities  and would not result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any of the company s outstanding debt  unless  with respect to certain debt instruments  preceded by a change in control of the company 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   the company had contractual obligations  excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities other than the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits  payable or maturing in the following periods 
in millions total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years short term debt long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities interest on short and long term debt and capital lease obligations operating leases other long term liabilities purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits contractual obligations interest payments on debt and capital lease obligations are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at the end of projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements 
certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations or other factors or events 
the projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at december  refer to note and note for further discussion regarding the company s debt instruments and related interest rate agreements outstanding at december  the primary components of other long term liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet are liabilities relating to pension and other postemployment benefit plans  litigation  foreign currency hedges  and certain income tax related liabilities 
the company projected the timing of the future cash payments based on contractual maturity dates where applicable and estimates of the timing of payments for liabilities with no contractual maturity dates 
the actual timing of payments could differ from the estimates 
the company contributed million  million and million to its defined benefit pension plans in  and  respectively 
most of the company s plans are funded 
the timing of funding in the future is uncertain and is dependent on future movements in interest rates and investment returns  changes in laws and regulations  and other variables 
therefore  the table above excludes pension plan cash outflows 
the pension plan balance included in other long term liabilities and excluded from the table above totaled billion at december  includes the company s significant contractual unconditional purchase obligations 
for cancelable agreements  includes any penalty due upon cancellation 
these commitments do not exceed the company s projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 
examples include firm commitments for raw material purchases  utility agreements and service contracts 
due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions  the long term liability relating to unrecognized tax benefits of million at december  has been excluded from the table above 
excludes contingent liabilities  including contingent milestone payments of billion associated with joint development and commercialization arrangements and contingent payments of million associated with acquisitions  as well as the company s unfunded commitment at december  of million as a limited partner in an investment company

financial instrument market risk the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings  cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates 
the company s hedging policy attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on the company s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
refer to note for further information regarding the company s financial instruments and hedging strategies 
currency risk the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to recognized assets and liabilities  forecasted transactions and net assets denominated in the euro  japanese yen  british pound  australian dollar  canadian dollar  brazilian real  colombian peso  and swedish krona 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows the company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets 
in addition  the company uses derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to foreign exchange 
gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and shareholders equity volatility relating to foreign exchange 
financial market and currency volatility may limit the company s ability to cost effectively hedge these exposures 
the company may use options  forwards and cross currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk to earnings relating to forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and recognized assets and liabilities 
the maximum term over which the company has cash flow hedge contracts in place related to forecasted transactions at december  is months 
the company also enters into derivative instruments to hedge certain intercompany and third party receivables and payables and debt denominated in foreign currencies 
in december  the company entered into option contracts with a total notional amount of billion to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash outflows associated with the planned acquisition of gambro 
these contracts are not formally designated as hedges and mature in june changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately in earnings and may be significant  subjecting the company s earnings to additional volatility 
currency restrictions enacted in venezuela require baxter to obtain approval from the venezuelan government to exchange venezuelan bolivars for us dollars and require such exchange to be made at the official exchange rate established by the government 
on january   the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate of relative to the us dollar 
the official exchange rate for imported goods classified as essential  such as food and medicine  was changed to  while the rate for payments for non essential goods was changed to in  the majority of the company s products imported into venezuela were classified as essential goods and qualified for the rate 
effective january   the venezuelan government devalued the official currency for imported goods classified as essential to since january   venezuela has been designated as a highly inflationary economy under gaap and as a result  the functional currency of the company s subsidiary in venezuela is the us dollar 
the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and designation of venezuela as highly inflationary did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company 
as of december   the company s subsidiary in venezuela had net assets of million denominated in the venezuelan bolivar 
in  net sales in venezuela represented less than of baxter s 
table of contents total net sales 
effective february   the venezuelan government devalued the official exchange rate from to  which is not expected to have a material impact on the financial results of the company 
as part of its risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange instruments relating to hypothetical and reasonably possible near term movements in foreign exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december   while not predictive in nature  indicated that if the us dollar uniformly weakened by against all currencies  on a net of tax basis  the net asset balance of million with respect to those contracts would increase by million 
a similar analysis performed with respect to option and forward contracts outstanding at december  indicated that  on a net of tax basis  the net asset balance of million would decrease by million  resulting in a net liability position 
the sensitivity analysis model recalculates the fair value of the foreign exchange option and forward contracts outstanding at december  by replacing the actual exchange rates at december  with exchange rates that are weaker compared to the actual exchange rates for each applicable currency 
all other factors are held constant 
these sensitivity analyses disregard the possibility that currency exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the analyses also disregard the offsetting change in value of the underlying hedged transactions and balances 
interest rate and other risks the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that the company believes is appropriate 
to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner  the company periodically enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 
the company also periodically uses forward starting interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates relating to anticipated issuances of term debt 
as part of its risk management program  the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential gains and losses in earnings relating to hypothetical movements in interest rates 
a basis point increase in interest rates approximately of the company s weighted average interest rate during affecting the company s financial instruments  including debt obligations and related derivatives  would have an immaterial effect on the company s  and earnings and on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt as of the end of each fiscal year 
as discussed in note  the fair values of the company s long term litigation liabilities and related insurance receivables were computed by discounting the expected cash flows based on currently available information 
a movement in the assumed discount rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair values of those assets and liabilities 
with respect to the company s investments in affiliates  the company believes any reasonably possible near term losses in earnings  cash flows and fair values would not be material to the company s consolidated financial position

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical because these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and require significant  difficult or complex judgments by the company  often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results that differ from the company s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
other than changes required due to the issuance of new accounting pronouncements  there have been no significant changes in the company s application of its critical accounting policies during the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the following is a summary of accounting policies that the company considers critical to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and related provisions and allowances the company s policy is to recognize revenues from product sales and services when earned 
refer to note for additional information regarding the company s accounting policy for revenue recognition  including the company s accounting for arrangements in which it commits to delivering multiple products or services to its customers 
provisions for discounts  rebates to customers  chargebacks to wholesalers  and returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recorded  and are reflected as a reduction of sales 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and  if necessary  revised  with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to sales 
the company periodically and systematically evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the reserve  the company considers historical credit losses  the past due status of receivables  payment history and other customer specific information  and any other relevant factors or considerations 
the company also provides for the estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranty programs when the cost is both probable and reasonably estimable  which is at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the cost is determined based on actual company experience for the same or similar products as well as other relevant information 
estimates of future costs under the company s warranty programs could change based on developments in the future 
the company is not able to estimate the probability or amount of any future developments that could impact the reserves  but believes presently established reserves are adequate 
pension and other postemployment benefit opeb plans the company provides pension and other postemployment benefits to certain of its employees 
these employee benefit expenses are reported in the same line items in the consolidated income statement as the applicable employee s compensation expense 
the valuation of the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for the plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions are reviewed annually  and revised if appropriate 
the significant assumptions include the following interest rates used to discount pension and opeb plan liabilities  the long term rate of return on pension plan assets  rates of increases in employee compensation used in estimating liabilities  anticipated future healthcare costs used in estimating the opeb plan liability  and other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover used in estimating liabilities 

table of contents selecting assumptions involves an analysis of both short term and long term historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation also called the measurement date 
the use of different assumptions would result in different measures of the funded status and net cost 
actual results in the future could differ from expected results 
the company is not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results  but believes its assumptions are appropriate 
the company s key assumptions are listed in note the most critical assumptions relate to the plans covering us and puerto rico employees  because these plans are the most significant to the company s consolidated financial statements 
discount rate assumption for the us and puerto rico plans  at the measurement date december   the company used a discount rate of and to measure its benefit obligations for the pension plans and opeb plan  respectively 
these discount rates will be used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for the company used a broad population of approximately aa rated corporate bonds as of december  to determine the discount rate assumption 
all bonds were denominated in us dollars  with a minimum amount outstanding of million 
this population of bonds was narrowed from a broader universe of over moody s aa rated  non callable or callable with make whole provisions bonds by eliminating the top th percentile and bottom th percentile to adjust for any pricing anomalies and to represent the bonds baxter would most likely select if it were to actually annuitize its pension and opeb plan liabilities 
this portfolio of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the projected benefit payments for the us and puerto rico plans 
the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 
for plans in canada  japan  the united kingdom and the eurozone  the company uses a method essentially the same as that described for the us and puerto rico plans 
for the company s other international plans  the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates 
to understand the impact of changes in discount rates on pension and opeb plan cost  the company performs a sensitivity analysis 
holding all other assumptions constant  for each basis point ie  one half of one percent increase decrease in the discount rate  global pre tax pension and opeb plan cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
return on plan assets assumption in measuring net periodic cost for  the company used a long term expected rate of return of for the pension plans covering us and puerto rico employees 
for measuring the net periodic benefit cost for these plans for  this assumption will decrease to 
this assumption is not applicable to the company s opeb plan because it is not funded 
the company establishes the long term asset return assumption based on a review of historical compound average asset returns  both company specific and relating to the broad market based on the company s asset allocation  as well as an analysis of current market and economic information and future expectations 
the current asset return assumption is supported by historical market experience for both the company s actual and targeted asset allocation 
in calculating net pension cost  the expected return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is a component of the total net unrecognized gain or loss and is subject to amortization in the future 
to understand the impact of changes in the expected asset return assumption on net cost  the company performs a sensitivity analysis 
holding all other assumptions constant  for each basis point increase decrease in the asset return assumption  global pre tax pension plan cost would decrease increase by approximately million 

table of contents other assumptions the company used the rp mortality table to calculate the pension and opeb plan benefit obligations for its plans in the united states and puerto rico 
for all other pension plans  the company utilized country and region specific mortality tables to calculate the plans benefit obligations 
the company periodically analyzes and updates its assumptions concerning demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover  considering historical experience as well as anticipated future trends 
the assumptions relating to employee compensation increases and future healthcare costs are based on historical experience  market trends  and anticipated future company actions 
refer to note for information regarding the sensitivity of the opeb plan obligation and the total of the service and interest cost components of opeb plan cost to potential changes in future healthcare costs 
legal contingencies the company is involved in product liability  patent  commercial  regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business 
refer to note for further information 
the company records a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
the company has established reserves for certain of its legal matters 
the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for certain of the legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved 
the company also records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring 
at december   total legal liabilities were million and total related receivables were million 
the company s loss estimates are generally developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on analyses of potential results 
with respect to the recording of any insurance recoveries  after completing the assessment and accounting for the company s legal contingencies  the company separately and independently analyzes its insurance coverage and records any insurance recoveries that are probable of occurring at the gross amount that is expected to be collected 
in performing the assessment  the company reviews available information  including historical company specific and market collection experience for similar claims  current facts and circumstances pertaining to the particular insurance claim  the financial viability of the applicable insurance company or companies  and other relevant information 
while the liability of the company in connection with certain claims cannot be estimated with any certainty  and although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for that period  the outcome of these legal proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
while the company believes it has valid defenses in these matters  litigation is inherently uncertain  excessive verdicts do occur  and the company may in the future incur material judgments or enter into material settlements of claims 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and reserves for uncertain tax positions the company maintains valuation allowances unless it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
changes in valuation allowances are included in the company s tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future  particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected  or if the company takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 
in the normal course of business  the company is audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges relate to the timing and amount of 
table of contents deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
the company believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap  based on the technical support for the positions  the company s past audit experience with similar situations  and potential interest and penalties related to the matters 
the company s results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
valuation of intangible assets  including ipr d the company acquires intangible assets and records them at fair value 
valuations are generally completed for business acquisitions using a discounted cash flow analysis  incorporating the stage of completion and consideration of market participant assumptions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow analysis include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows  the discount rate used to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows  the assessment of the asset s life cycle  and the competitive and other trends impacting the asset  including consideration of technical  legal  regulatory  economic and other factors 
each of these factors and assumptions can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
acquired in process r d ipr d is the value assigned to acquired technology or products under development which have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
acquired ipr d included in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite lived intangible asset 
development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred 
upon receipt of regulatory approval of the related technology or product  the indefinite lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
if the r d project is abandoned  the indefinite lived asset is charged to expense 
r d acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately 
for such transactions  payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset  and are classified as intangible assets 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with r d projects  there is no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the underlying assumptions used to prepare discounted cash flow analyses  nor that the r d project will result in a successful commercial product 
impairment of assets goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually  and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
intangible assets with definite lives and other long lived assets such as fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
refer to note for further information 
the company s impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital use  foreign currency exchange rates  the selection of an appropriate discount rate  asset groupings  and other assumptions and estimates 
the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company s business plans and a market participant s views of the company and similar companies 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair values of the assets  and potentially result in different impacts to the company s results of operations 
actual results may differ from the company s estimates 
stock based compensation plans stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the substantive vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value model 
table of contents to use requires judgment 
determining the assumptions that enter into the model is highly subjective and also requires judgment 
the company s stock compensation costs primarily relate to awards of stock options  restricted stock units rsus  and performance share units psus 
the company uses the black scholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options  and significant assumptions include long term projections regarding stock price volatility  employee exercise  post vesting termination and pre vesting forfeiture behaviors  interest rates and dividend yields 
the fair value of rsus is equal to the quoted price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
the company uses a monte carlo model for estimating the fair value of psus  and significant inputs include the risk free rate  volatility of returns and correlation of returns
