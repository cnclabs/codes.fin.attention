item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our current research and development activities are focused on developing technologies and product candidates to treat cancers and infectious diseases 
our core technology portfolio consists of our saponin platform based on our saponin adjuvant based technologies and our heat shock protein hsp platform based on our hsp based technologies 
some of our key candidates from these technology platforms are qs stimulon adjuvant qs stimulon  herpv  and the prophage series vaccines 
qs stimulon is an adjuvant  or a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy that is intended to enhance immune response 
the key licensees of qs stimulon are glaxosmithkline gsk and janssen alzheimer immunotherapy janssen ai 
there are approximately vaccines containing qs stimulon in clinical development by our licensees  including a total of four in phase testing for malaria  melanoma  non small cell lung cancer and shingles 
the first products containing qs stimulon are anticipated to be launched in  and we are generally entitled to royalties for at least years after commercial launch  with some exceptions 
herpv is derived from our hsp platform technologies  and is a recombinant  synthetic  non patient specific therapeutic vaccine candidate administered with qs stimulon for the treatment of genital herpes 
it has completed phase testing  where it was shown to elicit both cd and cd positive t cell responses a first of its kind finding in genital herpes treatment 
because the product contains multiple antigens derived from the herpes simplex virus hsv  it may be applicable to a broader patient population and may have potential in managing outbreaks and disease transmission 
we consider this to be a platform technology  since we could potentially create therapeutic vaccines for various infectious diseases with the integration of heat shock proteins with antigenic peptides 
we initiated a phase randomized  double blind  multicenter trial in october the prophage series vaccines are a patient specific application of our hsp platform 
the prophage series vaccine r is referred to as oncophage vaccine and is approved in russia for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma rcc  or kidney cancer in patients at intermediate risk of recurrence 
in december  we granted newvac llc a subsidiary of chemrar ventures llc an exclusive license to manufacture  market and sell oncophage as well as pursue a development program in the russian federation and certain other cis countries 
a phase trial testing the prophage series vaccine candidate g in newly diagnosed glioma has been fully enrolled and patient follow up is underway 
separately  a phase trial with g in recurrent glioma has been completed and final data are in the process of being prepared for publication in a peer reviewed medical journal 
the g and g studies are solely based in the united states 
the cancer therapy evaluation program of the national cancer institute nci approved a study of the prophage series g vaccine in a randomized phase trial in combination with avastin bevacizumab in patients with surgically resectable recurrent glioma 
the study will be sponsored by the alliance for clinical trials in oncology  an nci cooperative group 
this study is anticipated to begin enrolling patients during the first half of in addition to our internal development efforts  we continue to pursue partnering opportunities 
we are seeking partners for select products in our portfolio  which include the prophage g series vaccines  g and g  qs stimulon  and herpv 
we are also exploring in licensing  acquisitions and sponsored research opportunities 
our business activities have included product research and development  intellectual property prosecution  manufacturing  regulatory and clinical affairs  corporate finance and development  market development  business development  and support of our collaborations 
research and development expenses for the the years ended december    and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and convertible notes 
we believe that  based on our current plans and activities  our working capital resources at december   along with the estimated proceeds from our license  and collaborative agreements  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements through based on our expected annual use of cash of million during we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our funds 
we may attempt to raise additional funds by out licensing technologies or products to one or more third parties  renegotiating third party agreements  selling assets  securing additional debt financing and or selling equity securities  including  without limitation  in at the market offerings 
satisfying long term liquidity needs may require the successful commercialization and or one or more partnering arrangements for vaccines containing qs stimulon under

our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol agen 
historical results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue we generated revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue includes license fees and royalties earned  and in  service revenue 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenue of million through an expanded license agreement with gsk  which provided gsk with additional license rights in an undisclosed indication  and million through a license of non core technologies with an existing licensee that resulted in a buy out of the current royalty stream related to the license 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded revenue of million and million  respectively  from the amortization of deferred revenue 
our revenue for the year ended december  primarily resulted from one time payments received under amended license agreements and therefore is not indicative of future results 
research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities  including compensation and benefits  occupancy costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs of consultants  and administrative costs 
research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  decreased expenses related to our general cost containment efforts and the status of our products under development were partially offset by increased expenses related to our herpv program and non cash share based compensation expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  facility expenses  and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our non cash share based compensation expense increased million for the year ended december  over the same period in this increase was partially offset by decreased expenses related to our general cost containment efforts 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is related to an increase in the amount of debt discount amortized related to our notes in addition to the increase in the principal amount of debt outstanding 
interest on our notes is payable semi annually on december and june in cash or  at our option  in additional notes or a combination thereof 
during the years ended december  and  interest expense included million and million  respectively  paid in the form of additional notes 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue we generated revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue includes license fees and royalties earned  and in  revenue earned on shipments of qs stimulon to our qs stimulon licensees  grants earned and oncophage sales 
in the years ended december  and  we recorded revenue of million and million  respectively  from the amortization of deferred revenue related to our qs stimulon partnered programs 
research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities  including compensation and benefits  occupancy costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs of consultants  and administrative costs 
research and development expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the overall status of our development programs and includes million for amortization and depreciation expense   related to our noncash share based compensation expense  and  related to the reduced production of clinical product to our licensees due to the transfer of manufacturing rights 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  facility expenses  and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is largely due to the status of our development programs and our cost containment efforts and includes  related to our employee and director noncash share based compensation expense   for amortization and depreciation expense  and  for personnel related expenses 

table of contents non operating income non operating income of million for the year ended december  consists of a net gain of million on the extinguishment of a portion of our notes and the change in the fair value of our derivative liability since december  of million 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is related to the repurchase of substantially all of our notes during the year ended december  interest on our notes is payable semi annually on december and june in cash or  at our option  in additional notes or a combination thereof 
during the years ended december  and  interest expense included million and million  respectively  paid in the form of additional notes 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition to date 
research and development programs prior to  we did not track costs on a per project basis  and therefore have estimated the allocation of our total research and development costs to our largest research and development programs for that time period 
during  these research and development programs consisted largely of our prophage series vaccines and herpv  as indicated in the following table in thousands 
research and development program product year ended december  prior to total heat shock proteins for cancer prophage series vaccines heat shock proteins for infectious diseases herpv vaccine adjuvant qs stimulon other research and development programs total research and development expenses prior to  costs were incurred by aquila biopharmaceuticals  inc  a company we acquired in november research and development program costs include compensation and other direct costs plus an allocation of indirect costs  based on certain assumptions and our review of the status of each program 
our product candidates are in various stages of development and significant additional expenditures will be required if we start new trials  encounter delays in our programs  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  expand our operations  and or bring our product candidates to market 
the eventual total cost of each clinical trial is dependent on a number of factors such as trial design  length of the trial  number of clinical sites  and number of patients 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy  expensive  and uncertain 
because herpv is now in a phase trial and the further development of our prophage series vaccines is subject to evaluation and uncertainty  we are unable to reliably estimate the cost of completing our research and development programs  the timing of bringing such programs to various markets  and  therefore  when  if ever  material cash inflows are likely to commence 
programs involving qs stimulon  other than our herpv program  depend on our collaborative partners or licensees successfully completing clinical trials  successfully manufacturing qs stimulon to meet demand  obtaining regulatory approvals and successfully commercializing product candidates containing qs stimulon 
product development portfolio qs stimulon qs stimulon adjuvant  from our saponin platform  is an adjuvant  or a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy  that is intended to enhance immune response 
the key licensees of qs stimulon are gsk and janssen ai 
there are vaccines containing qs stimulon in clinical development  including a total of four in phase testing for malaria  melanoma  non small cell lung cancer and shingles 
the first products containing qs stimulon are anticipated to be launched in  and we are generally entitled to royalties for at least years after commercial launch  with some exceptions 

table of contents however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to collect royalties in the future 
the pipeline of product candidates containing qs stimulon is extraordinarily diverse  encompassing prophylactic as well as therapeutic vaccines for infectious diseases  multiple cancer types  and alzheimer s disease 
we do not incur clinical development costs for these products of our licensees 
for additional information regarding qs stimulon  please read part i item business of this annual report on form k 
herpv in october  we initiated a multicenter phase clinical trial of herpv designated in the study as ag plus qs stimulon in hsv genital herpes 
in this four arm  phase study  hsv seropositive patients received herpv  ag alone  qs stimulon alone  or placebo 
the vaccine was well tolerated  with injection site pain as the most common reported adverse event 
this study is the first to demonstrate that hsps complexed to viral antigens induce an antigen specific t cell response in humans 
the results from this study were published in the peer reviewed journal vaccine in september we have advanced herpv into a phase study during the fourth quarter of that will measure the effect of vaccination on viral shedding in individuals infected with hsv experts in hsv clinical research believe that a reduction in viral shedding could translate into clinical benefit 
for additional information regarding herpv  please read part i item business of this annual report on form k 
prophage series vaccines we started enrolling patients in our first clinical trial studying a prophage series vaccine at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york  new york in november to date  nearly cancer patients have been treated with our vaccine in clinical trials 
because prophage series vaccines are novel therapeutic vaccines that are patient specific  meaning derived from the patient s own tumor  they are experiencing a long development process and high development costs  either of which could delay or prevent our commercialization efforts 
for additional information regarding regulatory risks and uncertainties  please read the risks identified under part i item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the collective results from our clinical trials to date with product candidates from the prophage series indicate a favorable safety profile and signals of efficacy in multiple cancer types 
we also believe that available results from clinical trials suggest that treatment with the prophage series vaccines can generate immunological and anti tumor responses 
the prophage series vaccine r is referred to as oncophage vaccine and is approved in russia for the treatment of rcc in patients at intermediate risk of recurrence 
a phase trial testing the prophage series vaccine candidate g in newly diagnosed glioma has been fully enrolled and patient follow up is underway 
separately  a phase trial with g in recurrent glioma has been completed and final data are in the process of being prepared for publication in a peer reviewed medical journal

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred annual operating losses since inception  and we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we expect to incur significant losses over the next several years as we continue clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  prepare for commercialization  and continue development of our technologies 
we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and convertible notes  and interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances 
from our inception through december   we have raised aggregate net proceeds of million through the sale of common and preferred stock  the exercise of stock options and warrants  proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan  and the issuance of convertible notes 
during the quarter ended march   we received million from gsk for a first right to negotiate and an expanded license agreement and million through a license of non core technologies with an existing licensee 
we granted gsk the first right to negotiate for the purchase of the company or certain of our assets which will expire in five years 
the expanded license agreement provides gsk with an additional license to an undisclosed indication and also provides for additional royalty payments for this indication upon commercialization of a vaccine product 
the license of non core technologies converted a license grant from non exclusive to exclusive and enabled the licensee to buy out the current royalty stream structure 
we also maintain an effective registration statement to sell an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock from time to time pursuant to an at the market issuance sales agreement with mlv co 
llc  as sales agent 
as of december   we had debt outstanding of million in principal  including million in principal of our notes maturing august  our cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  an increase of million from december  this increase primarily resulted from one time payments received under amended license agreements of million as well as net proceeds of million received from at the market offerings and therefore is not indicative of our future financial condition 
however  we believe that  based on our current plans and activities  our cash balance  along with the estimated 
table of contents additional proceeds from our license  supply  and collaborative agreements  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements through based on our estimated annual use of cash of million during we continue to monitor the likelihood of success of our key initiatives and are prepared to discontinue funding of such activities if they do not prove to be feasible  restrict capital expenditures and or reduce the scale of our operations 
we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our current funds 
in order to fund our operations through and beyond  we will need to contain costs and raise additional funds 
we may attempt to raise additional funds by out licensing technologies or products to one or more third parties  renegotiating third party agreements  selling assets  securing additional debt financing and or selling equity securities  including  without limitation  in at the market offerings 
our ability to successfully enter into any such arrangements is uncertain  and if funds are not available  or not available on terms acceptable to us  we may be required to revise our planned clinical trials  other development activities  capital expenditures  and or the scale of our operations 
while we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our current funds  we may not be able to raise funds or raise amounts sufficient to meet the long term needs of the business 
satisfying long term liquidity needs may require the successful commercialization and or one or more partnering arrangements for herpv and the prophage series vaccines  vaccines containing qs stimulon under development by our licensees  and or potentially other product candidates  each of which will require additional capital 
we anticipate earning royalties from our qs stimulon product in please see note regarding forward looking statements on page of this annual report on form k and the risks highlighted under part i item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k 
our future cash requirements include  but are not limited to  supporting clinical trial and regulatory efforts and continuing our other research and development programs 
since inception  we have entered into various agreements with institutions and clinical research organizations to conduct and monitor our clinical studies 
under these agreements  subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable institution of certain services  we have estimated our payments to be million over the term of the studies 
through december   we have expensed million as research and development expenses and million has been paid related to these clinical studies 
the timing of expense recognition and future payments related to these agreements is subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable institution of certain services 
we have also entered into sponsored research agreements related to our product candidates that required payments of million  all of which has been paid as of december  we plan to enter into additional sponsored research agreements  and we anticipate significant additional expenditures will be required to advance our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  and bring our product candidates to market 
part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing collaborative arrangements with academic and collaborative partners and licensees and by entering into new collaborations 
as a result of our collaborative agreements  we will not completely control the efforts to attempt to bring those product candidates to market 
we have various agreements  for example  with collaborative partners and or licensees  which allow the use of our qs stimulon adjuvant in numerous vaccines 
these agreements grant exclusive worldwide rights in some fields of use and co exclusive or non exclusive rights in others 
these agreements generally provide us with rights to manufacture and supply qs stimulon to the collaborative partner or licensee and also call for royalties to be paid to us on future sales of licensed vaccines that include qs stimulon  which may or may not be achieved 
significant investment in manufacturing capacity could be required if we were to retain our manufacturing and supply rights 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million while cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  primarily resulted from one time payments received under amended license agreements and therefore is not indicative of future results 
during the year ended december   we recognized revenue of million related to expanded license agreements 
we continue to support and develop our qs stimulon partnering collaborations  and anticipate earning royalties from products containing qs stimulon in our future ability to generate cash from operations will depend on achieving regulatory approval of our product candidates  and market acceptance of oncophage and our product candidates  achieving benchmarks as defined in existing collaborative agreements  and our ability to enter into new collaborations

critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base those estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is dictated by us generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for our judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies 
share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those share based awards expected to vest 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
stock options granted to certain non employees have been accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting in accordance with asc  equity equity based payments to non employees 
as a result  the noncash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period  until the non employee options vest  by changes in the fair value of our common stock 
under the provisions of asc  the change in fair value of vested options issued to non employees is reflected in the statement of operations each reporting period  until the options are exercised or expire 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
revenue recognition 
table of contents revenue for services under research and development contracts are recognized as the services are performed  or as clinical trial materials are provided 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned 
license fees and royalties are recognized as they are earned 
revenue recognized from collaborative agreements is based upon the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  as amended by accounting standards update recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 comprehensive income asu which increases the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements 
under this standard  the components of net income and other comprehensive income must be presented in either one or two consecutive financial statements 
the standard eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
asu was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim and annual periods thereafter 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  asu 
asu requires entities to disclose items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and into net income in their entirety  the effect of the reclassification on each affected net income line item  and  for aoci reclassification items that are not reclassified in their entirety into net income  a cross reference to other required us gaap disclosures 
this consolidated standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
the application of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard asu 
asu simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment 
this amended guidance permits companies to first assess assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the revised standard was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this provisions of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in july  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
asu simplifies the guidance for testing the impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
the guidance allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
an entity electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as we seek debt financing and invest excess cash 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk related to our transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not currently employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging  to manage these exposures 
our currency exposures vary  but are primarily concentrated in the euro 
during the year ended december   there has been no material change with respect to our interest rate and foreign currency exposures or our approach toward those exposures 
however  commercialization of oncophage outside of the us could result in increased foreign currency exposure 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations as of december  fair value included herein has been estimated taking into consideration the nature and terms of each instrument and the prevailing economic and market conditions at december  the table presents principal payments by year of maturity based on the terms of the debt in thousands 
estimated fair value outstanding principal amount december  year of maturity long term debt fixed interest rates are and 
the above table is based on the assumptions that future interest on the notes is paid in cash and that these notes are not converted at maturity august  in certain circumstances  the notes could be converted before then 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt was derived by evaluating the nature and terms of each note and considering the prevailing economic and market conditions at the balance sheet date 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of million  which are exposed to the impact of interest and foreign currency exchange rate changes  and our interest income fluctuates as interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds  our carrying value approximates the fair value of these investments at december   however  we are subject to investment risk 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs  and maximize yields 
we review our investment policy annually and amend it as deemed necessary 
currently  the investment policy prohibits investing in any structured investment vehicles and asset backed commercial paper 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer  or type of investment 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is currently any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
