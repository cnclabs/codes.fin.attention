business overview we are an innovative technology solutions company that brings invention to market 
unleashing the intellectual power of our world class engineers and scientists in a collaborative and synergistic way  we invent  develop  offer and license solutions that challenge and enable our customers to create the future 
while we are best known for creating superior semiconductor memory architectures  we are also developing world changing products and services in security  advanced led lighting and displays  and immersive mobile media 
we believe we have established an unparalleled business platform and licensing platform that will continue to foster the development of new foundational technologies 
in addition to licensing  we are creating new business opportunities through offering products and services where our goal is to perpetuate strong company operating performance and long term stockholder value 
we generate revenue by licensing our inventions and solutions and providing services to market leading companies 
while we have historically focused our efforts on the development of technologies for electronics memory and chip interfaces  we have been expanding our portfolio of inventions and solutions to address additional markets in lighting  displays  chip and system security  digital media  as well as new areas within the semiconductor industry  such as imaging and non volatile memory 
we intend to continue our growth into new technology fields  consistent with our mission to create great value 
table of contents through our innovations and to make those technologies available through both our licensing and non licensing business models 
key to our efforts  both in our current businesses and in any new area of diversification  will be hiring and retaining world class inventors  scientists and engineers to lead the development of inventions and technology solutions for these fields of focus  and the management and business support personnel necessary to execute our plans and strategies 
we have four business units memory and interfaces division  or mid  which focuses on the design  development and licensing of technology that is related to memory and interfaces  cryptography research  inc  or cri  which focuses on the design  development and licensing of technologies for chip and system security and anti counterfeiting  lighting and display technologies  or ldt  which focuses on the design  development and licensing of technologies for lighting and displays  and mobile technologies division  or mtd  which focuses on the design  development and licensing of multi media solutions 
additionally  a centralized research and development and business incubation organization cto has been formed to consolidate early stage investments  longer term research activities and worldwide engineering  which also includes mtd 
as of december   only mid and cto were considered reportable segments as they met the quantitative thresholds for disclosure as a reportable segment 
the results of the remaining immaterial operating segments were combined and shown under all other 
for additional information concerning segment reporting  see note  segments and major customers  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
our strategy is to evolve from providing primarily patent licenses to providing additional technology  products and services while creating and leveraging strategic synergies to increase revenue 
we believe that the successful execution of this strategy requires an exceptional business model that relies on the skills and talent of our employees 
accordingly  we seek to hire and retain world class scientific and engineering expertise in all of our fields of technological focus  as well as the executive management and operating personnel required to successfully execute our business strategy 
in order to attract the quality of employees required for this business model  we have created an environment and culture that encourages  fosters and supports research  development and innovation in breakthrough technologies with significant opportunities for broad industry adoption 
we believe we have created a compelling company for inventors and innovators who are able to work within a business model and platform that focuses on technology development to drive strong future growth 
as of december   our semiconductor  lighting  display  security and other technologies are covered by  us and foreign patents 
additionally  we have  patent applications pending 
some of the patents and pending patent applications are derived from a common parent patent application or are foreign counterpart patent applications 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate and would further our overall business strategy and objectives 
in some instances  obtaining appropriate levels of protection may involve prosecuting continuation and counterpart patent applications based on a common parent application 
we believe our patented innovations provide our customers with the ability to achieve improved performance  lower risk  greater cost effectiveness and other benefits in their products and services 
our inventions and technology solutions are offered to our customers through either a patent license or a solutions license 
today  our revenues are primarily derived from patent licenses  through which we provide our customers a license to use a portion of our broad portfolio of patented inventions 
the license provides our customers with a defined right to use our innovations in the customer own digital electronics products  systems or services  as applicable 
the licenses may also define the specific field of use where our customers may use or employ our inventions in their products 
license agreements are structured with fixed  variable or a hybrid of fixed and variable royalty payments over certain defined periods 
leading consumer product  semiconductor and system companies such as amd  broadcom  elpida  freescale  fujitsu  ge  intel  panasonic  renesas  samsung and toshiba have licensed our patents for use in their own products 
the majority of our intellectual property in mid was developed in house and we intend to expand our business strategy of monetizing our mid intellectual property to include the sale of select intellectual property 
as any sales executed under this expanded strategy represent a component of our ongoing major or central operations and activities  we will record the related proceeds as revenue 
we also offer our customers solutions licenses to support the implementation and adoption of our technology in their products or services 
our customers include leading companies such as cooper lighting  elpida  ge  ibm  panasonic  samsung  sony and toshiba 
our solutions license offerings include a range of technologies for incorporation into our customers products and systems 
we also offer a range of services as part of our solutions licenses which can include know how and technology transfer  product design and development  system integration  and other services 
these solutions license agreements may have both a fixed price non recurring component and ongoing royalties 
further  under solutions licenses  our customers typically receive licenses to our patents necessary to implement these solutions in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts with us 
the remainder of our revenue is contract services revenue which includes license fees and engineering services fees 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenue or account receivables in any given period 

table of contents we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenue in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenue or expenses change 
executive summary on june   our board of directors appointed dr 
ronald d 
black as our new president and chief executive officer 
during  we signed license agreements with nvidia  mediatek  cooper lighting and fujitsu 
as a result of the patent license agreements with nvidia and mediatek  we settled all outstanding claims with them  including resolution of past use of our patented innovations 
the license agreement with fujitsu covers the use of our patented innovations implemented in a broad range of integrated circuit ic products offered by fujitsu semiconductor 
in  we also acquired unity semiconductor corporation unity  an innovative memory technology company for million in cash 
we expect that this acquisition will expand the breadth of our breakthrough memory technologies 
see note  acquisitions  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we completed a stock option exchange program 
see note  equity incentive plans and stock based compensation  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion regarding the stock option exchange program 
also during  the secure content storage association scsa selected our cri group to provide security leadership and expertise to the scsa efforts 
the goal of the scsa is to provide consumers with new ways to build digital home libraries 
the scsa initiative will give consumers an easier and faster way to organize  store and move their high definition digital movies and tv shows across multiple devices 
our security expertise will be deployed across this platform to provide the necessary security 
during the third quarter of  we initiated a restructuring effort to reduce overall corporate expenses which is expected to improve future profitability while refining some of our research and development efforts 
as a result of the restructuring program  we recorded a pre tax charge of million during related primarily to the reduction in workforce 
see note  restructuring charges  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
in addition  we recorded a non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets within our ldt group of million as a result of the change in our business strategy with less focus on the higher margin display technology licensing and an increased focus on our general lighting technologies 
see note  intangible assets and goodwill  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
research and development continues to play a key role in our efforts to maintain product innovations 
our engineering expenses in the aggregate for the year ended december  increased million as compared to primarily due to increased headcount related costs of million from additional employees to support our research and development efforts  increased amortization expense of million related to increased acquisitions  increased consulting expenses of million and increased accrual of retention bonuses related to acquisitions of million  partially offset by the million decrease in funding for our corporate incentive plan cip which is lower than our cip 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in the aggregate for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to primarily due to a decreased litigation expenses of million  million decrease in funding for our cip  and decreased stock based compensation expense of million  partially offset by increased headcount related costs of million from the average increase in employees to support our business 
trends there are a number of trends that may have a material impact on us in the future  including but not limited to  the evolution of memory technology  adoption of leds in general lighting  the use and adoption of our inventions or technologies and global economic conditions with the resulting impact on sales of consumer electronic systems 
we have a high degree of revenue concentration  with our top five customers representing approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result of our settlement with samsung in  samsung is expected to account for a significant portion of our ongoing licensing revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from samsung accounted for or more of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from elpida  nvidia and samsung each accounted for or more of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from elpida and samsung each accounted for or more of our total revenue 
we expect to continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future 

table of contents the particular customers which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  renewals of existing contracts  industry consolidation and the volumes and prices at which the customers have recently sold to their customers 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and highly cyclical  limiting our visibility with respect to future sales 
to the extent that macroeconomic fluctuations negatively affect our principal customers  the demand for our technology may be significantly and adversely impacted and we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in our operating results 
in february  elpida  one of our top customers by revenue for the past two years  commenced bankruptcy proceedings in japan as a result of debt loads  competition and declining prices for memory chips 
additionally  our royalty revenue from certain customers in the dram market  such as samsung and elpida  are variable and are based on our customers revenue two quarters in arrears 
the royalties we receive from our semiconductor customers are partly a function of the adoption of our technologies by system companies 
many system companies purchase semiconductors containing our technologies from our customers and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us 
our customers generally do not provide us with details as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies 
as a result  we face difficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenue will be dependent upon particular system companies 
system companies face intense competitive pressure in their markets  which are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences 
the display industry is also intensely competitive and highly cyclical 
since led backlighting solutions are increasingly pervasive in lcd for computers  smartphones  tablets  game systems  high definition televisions and any user interface incorporating an active display  the trend towards higher resolution displays across these products requires more leds per system 
the increased usage of leds is thereby creating a need for increased power efficiency since the led backlight is the primary source of power consumption in many consumer electronics products including smartphones 
the highly fragmented general lighting industry is undergoing a fundamental shift from incandescent technology to cold cathode fluorescent lights and led driven technology by the need to reduce energy consumption and to comply with government mandates 
led lighting typically saves energy costs as compared to existing installed lighting 
our ldt group patents in led edge lit lightguide technology also can be applied in the design of next generation led lighting products 
in january  we announced the launch of a rambus led bulb as an additional product offering incorporating our led technology 
this is our first step in marching towards our goal of being a major player in the general lighting industry 
global demand for effective security technologies continues to increase 
in particular  highly integrated devices such as smart phones and tablets are increasingly used for applications requiring security such as mobile payments  content protection  corporate information and user data 
our cri group is primarily focused on positioning its dpa countermeasures and cryptofirewall technology solutions to capitalize on these trends and growing adoption among technology partners and customers 
our revenue from companies headquartered outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that revenue derived from international customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
to date  all of the revenue from international customers have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such customers sales to their customers are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed products sold by our foreign customers were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed products could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
for additional information concerning international revenue  see note  segments and major customers  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
engineering costs in the aggregate and as a percentage of revenue increased in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
in the near term  we expect engineering costs to be higher as we intend to continue to make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our product innovation in semiconductor  lighting  security and other technologies 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in the aggregate and as a percentage of revenue decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
historically  we have been involved in litigation stemming from the unlicensed use of our inventions 
our litigation expenses have been high in the past and difficult to predict  and future litigation expenses could be significant  volatile and difficult to predict 
if we are successful in the litigation and or related licensing  our 
table of contents revenue could be substantially higher in the future 
if we are unsuccessful  our revenue may not grow or may decrease 
furthermore  our success in litigation matters pending before courts and regulatory bodies that relate to our intellectual property rights have impacted and will likely continue to impact our ability and the terms upon which we are able to negotiate new or renegotiate existing licenses for our technology 
we expect to continue to pursue litigation against those companies that have infringed our patented technologies  which in turn will cause litigation expenses to remain significant until such litigation is resolved 
additionally  in the near term  we expect our non litigation marketing  general and administrative costs to be lower due to our restructuring plan undertaken during the third quarter of our continued pursuit of litigation and investment in research and development projects  combined with any lower revenue from our customers in the future  will negatively affect our cash from operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenue royalties contract revenue total revenue operating costs and expenses cost of revenue research and development marketing  general and administrative restructuring charges impairment of goodwill and long lived assets costs of restatement and related legal activities  net gain from settlement total operating costs and expenses operating income loss interest income and other income  net interest expense interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss includes stock based compensation cost of revenue research and development marketing  general and administrative years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions total revenue royalties contract revenue nm nm total revenue nm percentage is not meaningful royalty revenue patent licenses 
table of contents our patent royalties decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to recognition of one time royalty revenue during from new patent license agreements signed in and lower royalties reported by certain customers in the semiconductor industry during the decreased revenue is partially offset by revenue recognized from various new patent license agreements signed in our patent royalties decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the one time recognition of royalty revenue from the settlement agreement signed with samsung in which was partially offset by the revenue recognized from one time and or ongoing licensing agreements with nvidia  broadcom  freescale and a major smartphone manufacturer in we are in negotiations with prospective customers 
we expect patent royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success in adding new customers  as well as the level of variation in our customers reported shipment volumes  sales price and mix  offset in part by the proportion of customer payments that are fixed or hybrid in nature 
solutions licenses royalties from solutions licenses decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to lower royalties reported from decreased shipments related to ddr technologies and lower royalties from xdr dram associated with decreased shipments of the sony playstation product 
royalties from solutions licenses decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to lower royalties reported from decreased shipments related to ddr technologies 
in the future  we expect solutions royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our customers shipment volumes  sales prices  and product mix 
royalty revenue by reportable segment royalty revenue from the mid reportable segment  which includes patent and solutions license royalties  decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to recognition of one time royalty revenue during from patent license agreements signed in and lower royalties reported by certain customers in the semiconductor industry and lower royalties reported from decreased shipments related to ddr technologies and lower royalties from xdr dram associated with decreased shipments of the sony playstation product 
the decreased revenue is partially offset by revenue recognized from various new patent license agreements signed in royalty revenue from the all other reportable segment increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a new license agreement signed in royalty revenue from the mid reportable segment decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the one time recognition of royalty revenue from the settlement agreement signed with samsung in and lower royalties reported from decreased shipments related to ddr technologies 
the decreased revenue was partially offset by the revenue recognized from one time and or ongoing licensing agreements with nvidia  broadcom and freescale in royalty revenue from the all other reportable segment increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a new patent license agreement signed in and various patent license agreements acquired through the cri acquisition in contract revenue contract revenue decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to absence of new technology development contracts in contract revenue from the mid reportable segment decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  contract revenue from the all other reportable segment decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  both decreases were primarily due to absence of new technology development contracts in contract revenue increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to new technology development contracts 
contract revenue from the mid reportable segment increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  contract revenue from the all other reportable segment increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  both increases were primarily due to new technology development contracts in we believe that contract revenue recognized will continue to fluctuate over time based on our ongoing contractual requirements  the amount of work performed  the timing of completing engineering deliverables  and by changes to work required  as well as new technology development contracts booked in the future 
engineering costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions engineering costs cost of revenue nm amortization of intangible assets nm stock based compensation nm total cost of revenue nm research and development stock based compensation total research and development total engineering costs nm percentage is not meaningful engineering costs are allocated between cost of revenue and research and development expenses 
cost of revenue reflects the portion of the total engineering costs which are specifically devoted to individual customer development and support services as well as amortization expense related to various acquired intellectual property for patent licensing 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for the development of applicable technologies  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of the development and implementation schedules of individual customer contracts 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  total engineering costs increased primarily due to increased headcount related costs of million from additional employees to support our research and development efforts  increased amortization expense of million related to intangible assets acquired since the second quarter of  increased consulting expenses of million and increased accrual of retention bonuses related to acquisitions of million  offset by million decrease in funding for our cip which is lower than our cip 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  total engineering costs increased primarily due to increased headcount related costs of million from additional employees including employees from the cri acquisition to support our development efforts  increased amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets of million as well as the accrual of the cri acquisition retention bonuses of million and higher prototyping costs of million  offset by the million decrease in funding for our cip which is lower than our cip 
in the near term  we expect engineering costs to be higher as we intend to continue to make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our product innovation in semiconductor  lighting  security and other technologies 
marketing  general and administrative costs 
table of contents years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions marketing  general and administrative costs marketing  general and administrative costs litigation expense stock based compensation total marketing  general and administrative costs marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  litigation  general legal  insurance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
litigation expenses have been a significant portion of our marketing  general and administrative expenses and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consistent with our business model  our licensing and marketing activities aim to develop or strengthen relationships with potential and current customers 
in addition  we work with current customers through marketing  sales and technical efforts to drive adoption of their products that use our innovations and solutions  by system companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period  these expenses generally do not correlate to the level of revenue in that period or in recent or future periods 
for the year ended december  as compared to  total marketing  general and administrative costs decreased which included a decrease in litigation expenses related to ongoing major cases of million 
non litigation related marketing  general and administrative costs remained relatively flat for the year ended december  as compared to  primarily due to increased headcount related costs of million from the average increase in employees to support our business during  increased accrual of retention bonuses of million related to acquisitions  increased amortization expense of million related to intangible assets acquired since the second quarter of and increased costs related to sales and marketing events of million  offset by million decrease in funding for our cip  which is lower than our cip 
for the year ended december  as compared to  total marketing  general and administrative costs increased primarily due to the increased litigation expenses of million related to ongoing major cases 
non litigation related marketing  general and administrative costs increased for the year ended december  primarily due to the accrual of the cri acquisition retention bonuses of million and increased headcount related costs of million from the increase in employees to support our business as well as higher consulting costs of million and the acquisition costs related to cri of million  offset by the million decrease in funding for our cip  which is lower than our cip  and lower stock based compensation expense of million 
in the future  marketing  general and administrative costs will vary from period to period based on the trade shows  advertising  legal  acquisition and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken  and the change in sales  marketing and administrative headcount in any given period 
in the near term  we expect our non litigation marketing  general and administrative costs to decrease due to our restructuring plan undertaken in litigation expenses are expected to vary from period to period due to the variability of litigation activities 
restructuring charges years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions restructuring charges nm n a n a not applicable nm percentage is not meaningful during  we initiated a restructuring program to reduce overall corporate expenses which is expected to improve future profitability by reducing spending on marketing  general and administrative programs and refining some of our research and development efforts 
as a result of the restructuring program  we recorded a pre tax charge of million during related primarily to the reduction in workforce  which included approximately million in early termination payments to certain employees related to their previous retention bonus arrangements 
we expect to substantially complete our restructuring activities by the first quarter of refer to note  restructuring charges  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and long lived assets years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions impairment of goodwill and long lived assets nm n a n a not applicable nm percentage is not meaningful as the change is too large during  we recorded a non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets within our ldt group of approximately million 
under generally accepted accounting principles  when indicators of potential impairment are identified  companies are required to conduct a review of the carrying amounts of goodwill and long lived assets to determine if impairment exists 
we conducted this impairment review as a result of the change in our business strategy with less focus on the higher margin display technology licensing and an increased focus on general lighting technologies 
refer to note  intangible assets and goodwill  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
costs of restatement and related legal activities years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions costs of restatement and related legal activities  net nm nm percentage is not meaningful costs of restatement and related legal activities consist primarily of settlement payments  investigation  audit  legal and other professional fees related to the stock option investigation and the filing of the restated financial statements and related litigation 
for the year ended december   cost of restatement and related legal activities were million primarily due to litigation expense associated with the derivative lawsuit related to the stock option investigation 
for the year ended december   costs of restatement and related legal activities were million primarily due to a settlement payment and the litigation expense associated with a private shareholder lawsuit related to the stock option investigation 
in december  we reached a settlement agreement that resolved the matter captioned stuart j 
steele  et al 
v 
rambus inc  et al  where we have agreed to settle the claims against us and the individual defendants for approximately million 
until all the litigation and related issues are resolved  we anticipate that there could be additional amounts relating to these matters in the future 
gain from settlement years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions gain from settlement n a n a not applicable the settlement with samsung is a multiple element arrangement for accounting purposes 
for a multiple element arrangement  we are required to determine the fair value of the elements 
we considered several factors in determining the accounting fair value of the elements of the settlement with samsung which included a third party valuation using an income approach  the black scholes merton option pricing model and a residual approach collectively the fair value 
the total gain from settlement related to the settlement with samsung of million has been recognized as of the end of the first quarter of the gain from settlement represents the fair value of the cash consideration allocated to the resolution of the antitrust litigation settlement and the residual value of other elements 
interest and other income expense  net years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions interest income and other income expense  net interest expense interest and other income expense  net interest income and other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities 
interest expense consists of interest expense associated with our imputed facility lease obligations on the sunnyvale and ohio facilities and non cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs on the convertible senior notes due the notes as well as the coupon interest related to the notes 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of interest expense in connection with the imputed financing obligations in our statement of operations 
see note  commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional details 
we expect our non cash interest expense to increase steadily as the notes reach maturity

provision for income taxes years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions provision for income taxes nm effective tax rate nm percentage is not meaningful our effective tax rates for the year ended december  and are different from the us statutory tax rate applied to our pretax loss because of the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets  foreign losses with no current tax benefit recorded  and foreign withholding and income taxes 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was different from the us statutory tax rate applied to our pretax income because of the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets  partially offset by foreign withholding taxes and state alternative minimum taxes 
for the year ended december   we paid withholding taxes of million 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million which is primarily comprised of withholding taxes  other foreign taxes and current state taxes 
for the year ended december   we paid withholding taxes of million 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million which is primarily comprised of withholding taxes  other foreign taxes and current state taxes 
for the year ended december   we paid withholding taxes of million 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million which is primarily comprised of withholding taxes  other foreign taxes and current state taxes 
as of december   we continued to maintain a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax attributes to fully utilize these assets 
based on all available evidence  we determined that it was not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
should we achieve sustained taxable income in the future  we would release the valuation allowance to recognize the deferred tax assets which would provide a valuable benefit to us

financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily due to proceeds of million from issuance of common stock under equity incentive plans  partially offset by million for payments under installment payment arrangements to acquire fixed assets and million related to the principal payments against the lease financing obligation 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  as a result of the repurchase in august from samsung of approximately million shares of the company s common stock for an aggregate amount of million pursuant to a put option exercised by samsung in accordance with the terms of a stock purchase agreement with samsung dated january  this is partially offset by million received from the landlord for the tenant improvements related to the lease in sunnyvale and million from issuance of common stock under equity incentive plans 
we also made payments of million under an installment payment plan to acquire intangible assets and computer software and million related to the principal payments against the lease financing obligation 
cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december  was primarily due to the payment upon maturity of million in face value of notes and stock repurchased with an aggregate price of million under our share repurchase program  which includes the shares purchased under share repurchase agreement with jp morgan  offset by proceeds received of million from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the stock purchase agreement with samsung 
additionally  we received approximately million from the issuance of common stock under equity incentive plans 
we also made payments of million under an installment payment plan to acquire intangible assets and computer software 
contractual obligations on december   we entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet of office space located at enterprise way in sunnyvale  california commencing on july  and expiring on june  the office space is used for our corporate headquarters  as well as engineering  marketing and administrative operations and activities 
we have two options to extend the lease for a period of months each and a one time option to terminate the lease after months in exchange for an early termination fee 
pursuant to the terms of the lease  the landlord agreed to reimburse us approximately million  which was received by the year ended december  we recognized the reimbursement as an additional imputed financing obligation as such payment from the landlord is deemed to be an imputed financing obligation 
on november   to better plan for future expansion  we entered into an amended lease for our sunnyvale facility for approximately an additional  square feet of space commencing on march  and expiring on june  additionally  a tenant improvement allowance to be provided by the landlord was approximately million 
on september   we entered into a second amended sunnyvale lease to reduce the tenant improvement allowance to approximately million 
we have not started the tenant improvements construction as of december  the annual base rent for these leases includes certain rent abatement and increases annually over the lease term 
on march   we entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet of office and manufacturing areas  located in brecksville  ohio 
the office space is used for ldt s engineering activities while the manufacturing space is used for the manufacturer of prototypes 
this lease was amended on september  to expand the facility to approximately  total square feet and the amended lease will expire on july  we have an option to extend the lease for a period of months 
we undertook a series of structural improvements to ready the sunnyvale and brecksville facilities for our use 
since certain improvements to be constructed by us were considered structural in nature and we were responsible for any cost overruns  for accounting purposes  we were treated in substance as the owner of the construction project during the construction period 
at the completion of each construction  we concluded that we retained sufficient continuing involvement to preclude de 
table of contents recognition of the building under the fasb authoritative guidance applicable to the sale leasebacks of real estate 
as such  we continue to account for the building as owned real estate and to record an imputed financing obligation for our obligation to the legal owners 
monthly lease payments on the facility are allocated between the land element of the lease which is accounted for as an operating lease and the imputed financing obligation 
the imputed financing obligation is amortized using the effective interest method and the interest rate was determined in accordance with the requirements of sale leaseback accounting 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized in our consolidated statements of operations million  million and million  respectively  of interest expense in connection with the imputed financing obligation on these facilities 
at december  and  the imputed financing obligation balance in connection with these facilities was million and million  respectively  which was primarily classified under long term imputed financing obligation 
in november  we entered into a lease agreement for approximately  square feet of office space in san francisco  california to be used for cri s office space and is treated as an operating lease 
this lease has a commencement date of february  and a lease term of months from the commencement date 
the annual base rent includes certain rent abatement and increases annually over the lease term 
in connection with the june  acquisition of cri  we are obligated to pay a retention bonus to certain cri employees and contractors  subject to certain eligibility and acceleration provisions including the condition of employment  in three equal amounts of approximately million 
the first payment was paid in cash during the second quarter of  and the remaining payments payable on june  and will be paid in cash or stock at our election 
as of december   the remaining retention bonus commitment is million and may be forfeited in part or whole by the covered employees and contractors upon voluntary departure from employment or discontinuation of services 
any amounts forfeited will be accelerated and paid by us to a designated charity 
see note  acquisitions  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information regarding the acquisition of cri 
on june   we entered into an indenture with us bank  national association  as trustee  relating to the issuance by us of million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
on july   an additional million in aggregate principal amount of notes were issued as a result of the underwriters exercising their overallotment option 
the aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding as of december  and was million  offset by unamortized debt discount of million and million  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the debt discount is currently being amortized over the remaining months until maturity of the notes on june  see note  convertible notes  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional details 
as of december   our material contractual obligations are as follows in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations imputed financing obligation leases and other contractual obligations software licenses acquisition retention bonuses convertible notes interest payments related to convertible notes total the above table does not reflect possible payments in connection with uncertain tax benefits of approximately million including million recorded as a reduction of long term deferred tax assets and million in long term income taxes payable  as of december  as noted in note  income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k  although it is possible that some of the unrecognized tax benefits could be settled within the next months  we cannot reasonably estimate the outcome at this time 

table of contents with respect to the imputed financing obligation  the main components of the difference between the amount reflected in the contractual obligations table and the amount reflected on the consolidated balance sheets are the interest on the imputed financing obligation and the estimated common area expenses over the future periods 
leases and other contractual obligations include our current operating lease commitments and commitment to purchase intellectual property from elpida 
we have commitments with various software vendors for non cancellable license agreements generally having terms longer than one year 
the above table summarizes those contractual obligations as of december  which are also presented on our consolidated balance sheet under current and other long term liabilities 
in connection with recent acquisitions  we are obligated to pay retention bonuses to certain employees and contractors  subject to certain eligibility and acceleration provisions including the condition of employment 
the remaining million of cri retention bonuses payable on june  and will be paid in cash or stock at our election 
contingently redeemable common stock on january   pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement  samsung purchased for cash from us million shares of our common stock the shares with certain restrictions and put rights 
the issuance of the shares by us to samsung was made through a private transaction 
the stock purchase agreement provided samsung a one time put right  beginning months after the date of the stock purchase agreement and extending to months after the date of the stock purchase agreement  to put back to us up to million of the shares at the original issue price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of up to million 
the million shares were recorded as contingently redeemable common stock on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the stock purchase agreement prohibited the transfer of the shares by samsung for months after the date of the stock purchase agreement  subject to certain exceptions 
after expiration of the transfer restriction period on july   the stock purchase agreement provided that samsung could transfer a limited number of shares on a daily basis  provide us with a right of first offer for proposed transfers above certain daily limits  and  if no sale occurs to us under the right of first offer  allowed samsung to transfer the shares 
under the stock purchase agreement  we also agreed that after the transfer restriction period  samsung would have certain rights to register the shares for sale under the securities laws of the united states  subject to customary terms and conditions 
on july   we received notice from samsung exercising their option to put back to us approximately million of the shares for cash of million 
in august  we paid million to samsung in exchange for the million shares  which were retired 
the difference between the amount recorded as contingently redeemable common stock and the cash paid was recorded as additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet 
see note  settlement agreement with samsung  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
share repurchase program in october  our board of directors the board approved a share repurchase program of our common stock  principally to reduce the dilutive effect of employee stock options 
under this program  the board approved the authorization to repurchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock over an undefined period of time 
on february   the board approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional million shares 
share repurchases under the program may be made through open market  established plan or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with all applicable securities laws  rules  and regulations 
there is no expiration date applicable to the program 
the new share repurchase program replaces the program authorized in october on august   we entered into a share repurchase agreement the share repurchase agreement with jp morgan securities inc  as agent for jpmorgan chase bank  national association  london branch jp morgan to repurchase approximately million of our common stock  as part of our share repurchase program 
under the share repurchase agreement  we pre paid to jp morgan the million purchase price in the third quarter of for the common stock and jp morgan delivered to us approximately million shares of common stock at an average price of at the completion of the share repurchase agreement in december for the years ended december  and  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program 
for the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock with an aggregate price of approximately million  including the price paid pursuant to the share repurchase agreement 
as of december   we had repurchased a cumulative total of approximately million shares of our common stock with an aggregate price of approximately million since the commencement of the program in as of december   there remained an outstanding authorization to repurchase approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock 
we record stock repurchases as a reduction to stockholders equity 
we record a portion of the purchase price of the repurchased shares as an increase to accumulated deficit when the price of the shares repurchased exceeds the average original proceeds per share received from the issuance of common stock 
during the year ended december   the cumulative price of the shares repurchased exceeded the proceeds received from the issuance of the same number of shares 
the excess of million was recorded as an increase to accumulated deficit for the year ended december  shareholder litigation related to historical stock option practices see note  litigation and asserted claims  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition overview we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
determination of whether or not these criteria have been met may require us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates based upon current information and historical experience 
certain revenue contract consists of service fees associated with integration of our solutions into our customers products and fees associated with providing training  evaluation and test equipment to our customers 
under the accounting guidance  if the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery  we account for each deliverable separately 
when multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy 
we determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on our best estimate of selling price besp 
we have determined that vendor specific objective evidence of selling price for each deliverable is not available as there is a lack of consistent number of standalone sales and third party evidence is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third party pricing information 
we determined besp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions 
significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices  the size and volume of our transactions  the customer demographic  the geographic area where our services are sold  our price lists  our go to market strategy  historical standalone sales and contract prices 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by management  taking into consideration the go to market strategy 
as our go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in relative selling prices 
in most cases  the relative values of the undelivered components are not significant to the overall arrangement and are typically delivered within twelve months after the core product has been delivered 
in such agreements  selling price is determined for each component and any difference between the total of the separate besp and total contract consideration ie discount is allocated pro rata across each of the components in the arrangement 
our revenue consists of royalty revenue and contract revenue derived from mid  cri and ldt operating segments 
royalty revenue consists of patent license and solutions license royalties 
contract revenue consists of fixed license fees  fixed engineering fees and service fees associated with integration of our technology solutions into our customers products 
royalty revenue 
table of contents we recognize royalty revenue upon notification by our customers and when deemed collectible 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally either require customers to give us notification and to pay the royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales occur or are based on a fixed royalty that is due within days of the end of the quarter 
many of our customers have the right to cancel their licenses 
in such arrangements  revenue is only recognized to the extent that is consistent with the cancellation provisions 
cancellation provisions within such contracts generally provide for a prospective cancellation with no refund of fees already remitted by customers for products provided and payment for services rendered prior to the date of cancellation 
we have two types of royalty revenue patent license royalties and solutions license royalties 
patent licenses we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to companies who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
the contractual terms of the agreements generally provide for payments over an extended period of time 
for the licensing agreements with fixed royalty payments  we generally recognize revenue from these arrangements as amounts become due 
for the licensing agreements with variable royalty payments which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold  we earn royalties at the time that the customers sales occur 
our customers  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
as we are unable to estimate the customers sales in any given quarter to determine the royalties due to us  we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by customers during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
in addition  we may enter into certain settlements of patent infringement disputes 
the amount of consideration received upon any settlement including but not limited to past royalty payments  future royalty payments and punitive damages is allocated to each element of the settlement based on the fair value of each element 
in addition  revenues related to past royalties are recognized upon execution of the agreement by both parties  provided that the amounts are fixed or determinable  there are no significant undelivered obligations and collectability is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize any revenues prior to execution of the agreement since there is no reliable basis on which we can estimate the amounts for royalties related to previous periods or assess collectability 
elements that are related to royalty revenue in nature including but not limited to past royalty payments and future royalty payments will be recorded as royalty revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
elements that are not related to royalty revenue in nature including but not limited to punitive damage and settlement will be recorded as gain from settlement which is reflected as a separate line item within the operating expenses section in the consolidated statements of operations 
solutions licenses we develop proprietary and industry standard products that we provide to our customers under solutions license agreements 
these arrangements include royalties  which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold 
we earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our customers at the time that the customers sales occur 
our customers  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
as we are unable to estimate the customers sales in any given quarter to determine the royalties due to us  we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by customers during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
contract revenue we generally recognize revenue using percentage of completion for development contracts related to licenses of our solutions that involve significant engineering and integration services 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion using input measures based upon contract costs incurred 
we have evaluated use of output measures versus input measures and have determined that our output is not sufficiently uniform with respect to cost  time and effort per unit of output to use output measures as a measure of progress to completion 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the customer 
the remaining fees may be due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the total costs required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total efforts necessary to complete a project are less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the newly estimated total efforts necessary to complete a project are longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees will be recognized over a longer period 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we will recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a material impact on deferred revenue or unbilled receivables in any given period 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the fair value of net assets received 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised of patents  customer contracts and contractual relationships  existing technology  intellectual property and other intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
goodwill is not subject to amortization  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  applying a fair value based test 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is allocation to various reporting units  which are generally an operating segment 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using an income or discounted cash flows approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
under the income approach  we measure fair value of the reporting unit based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management which is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our discounted cash flow projections are based on our annual financial forecasts developed internally by management for use in managing our business 
we amortize long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant loss of clients  and significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure the potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect the calculation of the fair value of our long lived assets 
in august  as a result of the change in business strategy for the ldt reporting unit  we revised our projected cash flows for ldt  triggering an interim impairment analysis for goodwill and long lived assets 
the decline in the projected cash flows for ldt resulted from a change in business strategy with less focus on the higher margin display technology licensing and an increased focus on our general lighting technologies 
as a result of the interim impairment analysis  we concluded that our ldt asset group was not able to recover the carrying amount of our ldt assets 
determining the fair value of an asset group unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  considered to be level fair value inputs  including current replacement costs  revenue growth rates and operating margins  and discount rates  among others 
accordingly  we were required to make various estimates in determining the fair values of the ldt asset group 
due to the highly customized nature of the ldt manufacturing equipment  we primarily utilized the cost approach to estimate the fair value of its property  plant and equipment 
to determine the estimated fair value of its property  plant and equipment  adjustment factors  including cost trend factors  were applied to each individual asset original cost in order to estimate current replacement cost 
the current replacement cost was then adjusted for estimated deductions to recognize the effects of deterioration and obsolescence from all causes  as well as indirect costs such as installation 
where appropriate  we utilized a market approach to estimate the fair value of our property  plant and equipment 
this approach included the identification of market prices in actual transactions for similar assets based on asking prices for assets currently available for sale  as well as obtaining and reviewing certain direct market values based quoted prices with manufacturers and secondary market participants for similar equipment 
upon completion of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million and million for building improvements and software in our ldt asset group  respectively 
the estimated fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined based on the income approach  using level fair value inputs  as it was deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 

table of contents under the income approach  we determined fair value based on the estimated future cash flows resulting from the licensing of the technology underlying the intangible assets 
the estimated cash flows in the income approach were discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
upon completion of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of related to acquired intangible assets 
accordingly a long lived asset impairment charge aggregating to million was included in impairment of goodwill and long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
as noted above  the company performed an event driven interim impairment analysis of goodwill as of august  we estimated the fair value of all the reporting units using the income approach which was determined using level fair value inputs 
the utilization of the income approach to determine fair value requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using an estimated discount rate 
cash flow projections are based on management estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins  taking into consideration industry and market conditions 
the discount rate used is based on a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with the characteristics of the business and the projected cash flows 
certain estimates used in the income approach involve information from businesses with developing revenue models and limited financial history  which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
one of the key assumptions used in applying the income approach includes discount rates which ranged from to depending on the reporting units overall risk profile relative to other guideline companies  the reporting units respective industry as well as the visibility of future expected cash flows 
upon the completion of the goodwill impairment analysis as of august   we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million relating to all of the goodwill of the ldt reporting unit 
the fair value of each of the other reporting units exceeded the goodwill carrying value 
the goodwill impairment charge is included in impairment of goodwill and long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis and we also finalized the financial information that will be regularly reviewed for resource allocation and performance assessment under the new internal reorganization which was announced in the third quarter of the new internal organization structure resulted in four reporting units mid  cri  ldt and mtd 
as of december   the fair value of our mid reporting unit  with million of goodwill  exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately  the fair value of our cri reporting unit  with million of goodwill  exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately  and the fair value of our mtd reporting unit  with million of goodwill  exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately 
to arrive at our cash flow projections utilized in the income approach  we used the reporting unit s forecast of estimated operating results based on key assumptions such as long term revenue growth rates  costs and estimates of future anticipated changes in operating margins based on economic and market information 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units at december   were the expected after tax cash flows for the forecast period and terminal year  terminal growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
certain estimates used in the income approach involve information from businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
one of the key assumptions used in applying the income approach include discount rates which ranged from to depending on the reporting units overall risk profile relative to other guideline companies  the reporting units respective industry as well as the visibility of future expected cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the businesses could perform significantly below our expectations or a deterioration of market and economic conditions could occur 
this would adversely impact our ability to meet our projected results  which could cause the goodwill in any of our reporting units or long lived assets in any of our asset groups to become impaired 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
if the mtd and ldt reporting units are not successful in commercializing new business arrangements  or if we are unsuccessful in signing new license agreements or renewing our existing license agreements for the mid and cri reporting units  the revenue and income for these reporting units could adversely and materially deviate from their historical trends and could cause goodwill or long lived assets to become impaired 
if we determine that our goodwill or long lived assets are impaired  we would be required to record a non cash charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
litigation we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in note  litigation and asserted claims  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
based upon consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  if we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated  we record the estimated liability in our consolidated financial statements 
if only a range of estimated losses can be estimated  we record an amount within the range that  in our judgment  reflects the most likely outcome  if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record the liability at the low end of the range of estimates 
any such accrual would be charged to expense in the appropriate period 
we recognize litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided 
income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate the income tax expense or benefit which relates to the pretax income or loss for the period 
in addition  we are required to assess the realization of the deferred tax asset or liability to be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting dates 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets  before valuation allowance  of approximately million  which consists of net operating loss carryovers  tax credit carryovers  amortization  employee stock based compensation expenses and certain liabilities  partially reduced by deferred tax liabilities associated with the convertible debt instruments 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million reduced net deferred tax assets to million 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax statutes to fully utilize these assets 
our forecasted future operating results are highly influenced by  among other factors  assumptions regarding our ability to achieve our forecasted revenue  our ability to effectively manage our expenses in line with our forecasted revenue and general trends in the industries in which we operate 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax statutes to fully utilize these assets 
we weighed both positive and negative evidence and determined that there is a continued need for a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of generating sufficient taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets based on forecasted revenues  which we considered significant negative evidence 
though considered positive evidence  potential income from currently unsigned favorable patent and related settlement litigation were not included in the determination for the valuation allowance due to our inability to reliably estimate the probability  timing and amounts of such settlements 
even though we are no longer in a cumulative loss position  the uncertainty of generating sufficient taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets based on forecasted revenues is a negative factor that outweighs the positive factors leading to a conclusion that a release of the valuation allowance is not yet appropriate 
tax attributes related to stock option windfall deductions are not to be recognized until they result in a reduction of cash taxes payable 
the benefit of these excess tax benefits will be recorded to equity when they reduce cash taxes payable 
we will only recognize a tax benefit from stock based awards in additional paid in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock based awards on other tax attributes  such as the research tax credits  through the consolidated statement of operations as part of the tax effect of stock based compensation 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although fasb accounting standards codification asc income taxes  provides further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  significant judgment is required by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  it could materially affect income tax expense 
stock based compensation we maintained stock plans covering a broad range of potential equity grants including stock options  nonvested equity stock and equity stock units and performance based instruments 
in addition  we sponsor an employee stock purchase plan espp  whereby eligible employees are entitled to purchase common stock semi annually  by means of limited payroll deductions  at a discount from the fair market value of the common stock as of specific dates 
the accounting guidance for share based payments requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in our statement of operations for all share based payment awards made to our employees  directors and consultants including employee stock options  nonvested equity stock and equity stock units  and employee stock purchase grants 
stock based compensation expense is measured at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  reduced by an estimate of the annualized rate of expected forfeitures  and is recognized as expense over the employees expected requisite service period  generally using the straight line method 
in addition  the accounting guidance for share based payments requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under previous accounting rules 
our forfeiture rate represents the historical rate at which our stock based awards were surrendered prior to vesting 
the accounting guidance for share based payments requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised on a cumulative basis  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
see note  equity incentive plans and stock based compensation  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for more information regarding the valuation of stock based compensation 
marketable securities available for sale securities are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices  with the unrealized gains or losses reported  net of tax  in stockholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity  both of which are included in interest and other income  net 
realized gains and losses are recorded on the specific identification method and are included in interest and other income  net 
we review our investments in marketable securities for possible other than temporary impairments on a regular basis 
if any loss on investment is believed to be other than temporary  a charge will be recognized in operations 
in evaluating whether a loss on a debt security is other than temporary  we consider the following factors our intent to sell the security  if we intend to hold the security  whether or not it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the security s amortized cost basis and even if we intend to hold the security  whether or not we expect the security to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
due to the high credit quality and short term nature of our investments  there have been no other than temporary impairments recorded to date 
the classification of funds between short term and long term is based on whether the securities are available for use in operations or other purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily arising from the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our investment portfolio 
interest rate fluctuation may arise from changes in the market s view of the quality of the security issuer  the overall economic outlook  and the time to maturity of our portfolio 
we mitigate this risk by investing only in high quality  highly liquid instruments 
securities with original maturities of one year or less must be rated by two of the three industry standard rating agencies as follows a by standard poor s  p by moody s and or f by fitch 
securities with original maturities of greater than one year must be rated by two of the following industry standard rating agencies as follows aa by standard poor s  aa by moody s and or aa by fitch 
by corporate investment policy  we limit the amount of exposure to million or of the portfolio  whichever is lower  for any single non us government issuer

no more than of the total portfolio may be invested in the securities of an industry sector  with money market fund investments evaluated separately 
our policy requires that at least of the portfolio be in securities with a maturity of days or less 
we may make investments in us treasuries  us agencies  corporate bonds and municipal bonds and notes with maturities up to months 
however  the bias of our investment portfolio is shorter maturities 
all investments must be us dollar denominated 
additionally  we have no significant exposure to european sovereign debt 
we invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of us dollar financial instruments such as us treasuries  us government agencies  commercial paper and corporate notes 
our policy specifically prohibits trading securities for the sole purposes of realizing trading profits 
however  we may liquidate a portion of our portfolio if we experience unforeseen liquidity requirements 
in such a case  if the environment has been one of rising interest rates we may experience a realized loss  similarly  if the environment has been one of declining interest rates we may experience a realized gain 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income marketable securities of million including cash equivalents 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels as of december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
actual results may differ materially from this sensitivity analysis

the fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of the convertible notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines in value 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our convertible notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation 
additionally  we do not carry the convertible notes at fair value 
we present the fair value of the convertible notes for required disclosure purposes

although the fluctuation of currency exchange rates may impact our customers  and thus indirectly impact us  we do not attempt to hedge this indirect and speculative risk 
our overseas operations consist primarily of design centers in india and italy and small business development offices in japan  korea and taiwan 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure  however  as of december   we believe our foreign currency exposure is not material enough to warrant foreign currency hedging
