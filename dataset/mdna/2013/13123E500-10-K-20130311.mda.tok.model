while we offer our customers a range of purchasing and deployment options  from on demand subscription to on premise term or perpetual license  our business and revenue model is focused on recurring revenue 
recurring revenues consist of saas revenues and recurring maintenance revenues 
saas revenues are primarily made up of on demand hosting revenues  sales operation services and term license revenue 
saas revenue growth  customer expansion and retention saas revenues continued to drive the growth in recurring revenues and total revenues in saas revenues grew to million in representing a million or increase from total recurring revenues in grew by from  reflecting the strong growth in saas revenues partially offset by an expected decline in recurring maintenance revenues primarily as a result of customers continuing to convert from on premise to on demand 
recurring revenues account for of our total revenues and we expect this percentage to increase going forward 
total revenues in were million  up million  or  from by driving our expanded product and services offerings  including acquired products 
strong saas revenues growth contributed to an increase in recurring revenue gross margins from in to in and an increase in overall gross margins from in to in during  we continued to add subscription based customers at historically high rates  adding new customers to the business  including customers added in connection with acquisitions 
we now have over  customers on an annual plan 
strong annual saas billings growth of helped drive an increase in our saas total annual contract value acv 
our total saas acv grew from the prior year to million 
our core saas customer retention rates on a dollar and customer count basis were 
we believe our high retention rates are an indication of the quality of service we provide and the quality of our customer base and we strive to maintain these retention rates in a competitive environment 

table of contents operating results during  we made substantial investments in expanding our sales force and improving our infrastructure

in  we also upgraded a majority of our business systems to cloud based technology  thereby improving our operating efficiency and positioning us for continued growth 
at the end of  we initiated substantial expense reductions and rationalizations that will contribute to greater effectiveness and improved operating results in we plan to continue to manage our operating expenses carefully in order to maintain proper alignment with the business and take advantage of cost saving measures and efficiencies where possible

callidus exercised this option and the transfer occurred during the fourth quarter of  for a fee of million  of which million was allocated to costs of recurring revenues  million was allocated to costs of service revenues  and million was allocated to research and development costs 
the exercise of this option added employees to our headcount at our new hyderabad  india office 
refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report regarding the acquisitions 
challenges and risks in response to market demand  over the past few years we have shifted our primary business focus from providing perpetual software licenses to providing on demand software as a service 
toward the end of we also began offering our on premise products under term license arrangements 
we believe that these offerings better address the needs of our customers  and at the same time  provide more predictable revenue streams 
for customers that prefer to purchase software on a perpetual basis  we continue to offer such licenses  and in the year ended december   we generated million in perpetual license revenues 
we expect perpetual license revenue to remain a relatively small component of total revenues and to fluctuate from period to period 
while we have a number of sales opportunities in process and additional opportunities coming from our sales pipeline  we continue to experience wide variances in the timing and size of our transactions 
we believe one of our major challenges continues to be increasing prospective customers prioritization of purchasing our solutions over competing projects 
as part of our effort to address this challenge  we have set goals that include expanding our sales efforts  promoting our on demand services and continuing to develop new products and enhancements to our suite of products 
during and  we completed eight acquisitions to expand our product offerings and customer base 
in addition  in we invested in the expansion of our sales force to better exploit the opportunities presented by 
table of contents our solutions 
we also invested in our infrastructure and are in the process of building a new data center to better serve our incoming customer base 
these investments have adversely affected our current operating results  however we expect to continue to realize the benefits of these investments going into our long term success will depend in part on our ability to realize return on these investments through increased revenues 
in addition to these risks  our future operating performance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in risk factors in section a of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations which follows is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the application of gaap requires our management to make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures regarding these items 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and service remediation reserve  stock based compensation  valuation of acquired intangible assets  goodwill impairment  long lived asset impairment  contingent consideration and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates in accordance with our critical accounting policies have not materially differed from actual results 
for a more detailed discussion of these accounting policies and our use of estimates  refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we recognize 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on revenue recognition policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts and service remediation reserve we estimate the uncollectability of accounts receivable  and record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 

table of contents we reserve future service claims based upon historical experience of actual remediation service claims as well as current information on remediation service requests as they are the primary indicators for estimating future service claims 
if our actual service claims are higher than expected  additional service remediation reserves may be needed and our future results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
stock based compensation expense for restricted stock units rsus is estimated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and the average historical forfeiture rate 
we measure the value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include the expected term of the options  taking into account projected exercises  our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
changes in these variables could materially affect the stock based compensation in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized  but instead goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and under certain circumstances 
we perform such testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year  or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
during the fourth quarter of  we early adopted new accounting guidance which simplifies goodwill impairment testing 
the new accounting guidance allows us to conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we then conduct a two step test for impairment of goodwill 
the first step of the test for goodwill impairment compares the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the reporting unit carrying value  we will perform the second step of the test for impairment of goodwill 
during the second step of the test for impairment of goodwill  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the calculated implied fair value  the excess amount will be recognized as an impairment loss 
we have one reporting unit and evaluate goodwill for impairment at the entity level 
based upon the results of the step one testing  the company concluded that no impairment existed as december   and did not perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to years 
generally  amortization is based on the higher of a straight line method or the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed 
there was no impairment expense related to intangible assets during  the years ended december  and during the year ended december   the company recognized an impairment of million 
impairment of long lived assets we assess impairment of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an 
table of contents asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
business combinations the company recognizes assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognized in earnings  recognizes acquisition related expenses and restructuring costs to be expensed as incurred  and recognizes changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes 
during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the business combination date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
after the measurement period  we record adjustments to the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in our operating results in the period in which the adjustments were determined 
contingent consideration we estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration issued in business combinations using a probability based income approach 
the fair value of our liability classified contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period  with any changes in the fair value recorded as income or expense 
contingent acquisition consideration payable is included in accrued liabilities and on the company consolidated balance sheets 
accounting for income taxes income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of those laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures for tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note to our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of newly adopted accounting pronouncements on our financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates  as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we invest in investment grade securities 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our investment portfolios  which is approved by our board of directors 
the guidelines establish  among others  credit quality standards and limits on exposure to i any one security issue or issuer and ii the type of instrument 

table of contents financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk are trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we mitigate market risk by monitoring ratings  credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis 
based on our on going assessment of counterparty risk  we will adjust our exposure to various counterparties as necessary 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of investments in money market accounts  certificates of deposit  high quality corporate debt obligations  and us government obligations 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  which typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investments was approximately months  and all investment securities had remaining maturities of less than months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  except for interest rates expected maturity year or less more than year total principal amount total fair value available for sale securities weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues and our expenses  except those related to our non united states operations  are generally denominated in united states dollars 
for our operations outside the united states  we generally transact business in various other currencies 
for and  approximately of our total revenues were denominated in foreign currency 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable was denominated in foreign currency 
our exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized losses on foreign exchange transactions of million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to transact a majority of our business in us dollars 
occasionally  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts  nor any losses related to forward exchange contracts for we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the immediate future 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our foreign exchange rate contract investment strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
in particular  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
we cannot make assurances that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows
