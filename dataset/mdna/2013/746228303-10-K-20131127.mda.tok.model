item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and use of estimates  and note water assets to the accompanying financial statements 
the million of capitalized water costs on our balance sheet represents the costs of the water rights we own and the related infrastructure developed to provide wholesale water and wastewater services 
each of these assets is explained in detail below 
the illustration below indicates the approximate location of each of our assets 
graphic the map below indicates the location of our denver area assets 
map rangeview water supply and the lowry range our rangeview water we own or control a total of approximately  acre feet of tributary surface water   acre feet of non tributary and not non tributary groundwater rights  and approximately  acre feet of adjudicated reservoir sites that we refer to as our rangeview water supply 
this water is located at the lowry range  which is owned by the state board of land commissioners the land board and is described below 
of the  acre feet of lowry range groundwater  we own approximately  acre feet of non tributary and not non tributary groundwater which we can export from the lowry range to supply water to nearby communities this portion of the rangeview water supply is referred to as our export water 
we also have the right to convert up to  acre feet of the export groundwater to a similar amount of surface water for use off the lowry range 
we hold the exclusive right to develop and deliver through the year the remaining  acre feet of groundwater  along with the balance of the surface water  for use on the lowry range 
we acquired our rangeview water supply in april pursuant to the following agreements i the amended and restated lease agreement the lease between the land board and the district  ii the agreement for sale of export water between us and the district  and iii the service agreement between us and the district for the provision of water service to the district s customers 
additionally  in we entered into a wastewater service agreement the wastewater agreement with the district to provide wastewater service to the district s customers 
all of the foregoing agreements are collectively referred to as the rangeview water agreements 
pursuant to the rangeview water agreements  we design  construct  operate and maintain the district s water and wastewater systems to allow the district to provide water and wastewater service to its customers located within the district s  acre service area at the lowry range 
on the lowry range  we operate both the water and the wastewater systems during our contract period on behalf of the district  who owns the facilities for both systems 
at the expiration of our contract term in  ownership of the water system facilities servicing customers on the lowry range will revert to the land board  with the district retaining ownership of the wastewater facilities 
through facilities we own  we use our export water  and we intend to use other supplies owned by us  to provide wholesale water service and wastewater service to customers located outside of the lowry range  including customers of the district and other governmental entities and industrial and commercial customers 
based on independent engineering estimates  the water designated for use on the lowry range is capable of providing water service to  sfe units  and the export water owned by the company can serve  sfe units throughout the denver metropolitan region 
the lowry range property the lowry range is located in unincorporated arapahoe county the county  about miles southeast of downtown denver 
the lowry range is one of the largest contiguous parcels under single ownership next to a major metropolitan area in the united states 
the lowry range is approximately  acres in size or about square miles of land 
of the  acres  pursuant to our agreements with the district  we have the exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services to approximately  acres of the lowry range 
however  as more fully described in item legal proceedings  we filed a lawsuit against the land board for failing to protect our exclusive rights under the lease in december rangeview metropolitan district the district is a quasi municipal corporation and political subdivision of colorado formed in for the purpose of providing water and wastewater service to the lowry range 
the district is required to utilize the  acre feet of water leased to it by the land board to serve customers on the lowry range 
the district is governed by an elected board of directors 
eligible voters and persons eligible to serve as directors of the district must own an interest in property within the boundaries of the district 
we own certain rights and real property interests which encompass the current boundaries of the district 
the current directors of the district are mark w 
harding and scott e 
lehman both employees of pure cycle  and an independent board member 
pursuant to colorado law  directors may receive for each board meeting they attend  up to a maximum of  per year 
mr 
harding and mr 
lehman have both elected to forego these payments 
south metropolitan water supply authority the south metropolitan water supply authority smwsa is a municipal water authority in the state of colorado organized to pursue the acquisition and development of new water supplies on behalf of its members 
smwsa members include denver area water providers in arapahoe and douglas counties 
the district became a member of smwsa in in an effort to participate with other area water providers in developing regional water supplies along the front range 
for over years  the smwsa members have been working with denver water and aurora water on a cooperative water project known as the water infrastructure supply efficiency partnership wise  which seeks to develop regional infrastructure which would interconnect member s water transmission systems to be able to develop additional water supplies from the south platte river in conjunction with denver water and aurora water 
in july of  the district together with other smwsa members formed the south metropolitan wise authority smwa to continue to develop the wise project 
through an agreement with the district  we support smwa and its joint water development efforts and may seek to participate in one or more regional water projects if such projects are in our best interest 
preliminary estimates for the district s capital expenditure related to the wise project are approximately million  which will be completed over a year period 
east cherry creek valley system pursuant to a contractual right  the district may purchase water produced from east cherry creek valley water and sanitation district s eccv land board system 
eccv s land board system is comprised of eight wells and over ten miles of buried water pipeline located on the lowry range 
in order to increase the delivery capacity and reliability of these wells  in may  in our capacity as rangeview s service provider and the export water contractor as defined in the lease  we entered into an agreement to operate and maintain the eccv facilities and we can utilize the system to provide water to commercial and industrial customers  including customers providing water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells 
hydraulic fracturing we generated revenues of  during our fiscal year ended august  from sales of drilling and frack water to third party service providers who were providing water for wells drilled into the niobrara formation 
with a large percentage of the acreage surrounding the lowry range in arapahoe  adams  elbert  and portions of douglas counties already leased by major oil companies  we anticipate providing additional water for drilling oil and gas wells in the coming fiscal year 
through select energy services  llc select  we are currently selling frack water to conocophillips  the largest oil and gas lease holder operating in the area 
in order to service this new demand  we have rehabilitated or are in the process of rehabilitating five of our eccv wells to service the industry and we have added approximately  ft of buried line so that we can deliver water directly to the industry both on and off of the lowry range 
we have increased our capacity to approximately  gallons per day to meet this demand and anticipate during fiscal that we will increase our delivery capacity to million gallons per day 
at present conocophillips has one rig working the area and is fracking well approximately every weeks 
each frack uses approximately million gallons 
we anticipate another rig will be added in early calendar during fiscal we sold approximately aft to the industry 
during september and october we sold an additional approximately aft to the industry 
sales of water to the industry by aft are detailed in the following chart 
line graph land board royalties pursuant to the rangeview water agreements  the land board is entitled to royalty payments based on a percentage of revenues earned from water sales that utilize water from the rangeview water supply 
the calculation of royalties depends on the water source  whether the customer is located on the lowry range or elsewhere  and whether the customer is a public or private entity 
the land board does not receive a royalty from wastewater services 
lowry range customers water service related payments from customers located on the lowry range generate royalties to the land board at a rate of of gross revenues 
when either i metered production of water used on the lowry range in any calendar year exceeds  acre feet or ii  surface acres on the lowry range have been rezoned to non agricultural use  finally platted and water tap agreements have been entered into with respect to all improvements to be constructed on such acreage  the land board may elect  at its option  to receive  in lieu of its royalty of of gross revenues  of the collective net profits ours and the district s derived from the sale or other disposition of water on the lowry range 
to date neither of these conditions has been met and such conditions are not likely to be met any time soon 
export water customers export water royalties are owed to the land board when our rangeview water supply is sold or disposed of to customers located off the lowry range 
if we incur costs to withdraw  treat and deliver water to such customers  royalties to the land board are based on our net revenues 
net revenues are defined as gross revenues less costs incurred as a direct and indirect result of incremental activity associated with the withdrawal  treatment and delivery of the water costs include reasonable overhead allocations 
royalties payable to the land board for export water sales escalate based on the amount of net revenue we receive and are lower for sales to a water district or similar municipal or public entity than for sales to a private entity as noted in table a 
table a royalties for export water sales royalty rate private public net revenues entity buyer entity buyer over  the land board is currently claiming that export royalties are owed on gross rather than net revenues and that it is entitled to a royalty on wastewater service revenues 
see item a risk factors we  the district and the land board entered into an arbitration agreement pursuant to which the parties have agreed to submit claims under the lease to binding arbitration and item legal proceedings 
arkansas river water and land we own approximately  acre feet of surface water rights in the arkansas river together with approximately  acres of irrigated farm land in southeastern colorado 
we acquired our arkansas river water and land from high plains a m  llc hp a m pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated may  the arkansas river agreement 
the water rights we own are represented by  shares of the fort lyon canal company the flcc  which is a non profit mutual ditch company established in the late s to operate and maintain the mile long fort lyon canal between la junta and lamar  colorado 
we have agreements to sell approximately  acres of farmland and  flcc shares for approximately million  which are expected to close during fiscal year in order to preserve our arkansas river water rights until we are ready to seek a change of use  we currently lease our land and water to area farmers who continue to irrigate the land for agricultural purposes 
in conjunction with the arkansas river agreement we entered into a property management agreement pursuant to which hp a m agreed to manage our farm properties and take care of our obligations under the farm leases  including property taxes in exchange for the rental income from the leases the property management agreement 
in august  we terminated the property management agreement due to certain defaults by hp a m under the terms of the arkansas river agreement and related agreements 
as a result of the termination  we now control all leasing activities and are entitled to all future income from such leasing activities 
we are also responsible for property taxes and other expenses associate with the properties 
we intend to continue managing our farms together with our tenant farmers 
for additional information concerning our rights and obligations under the arkansas river agreement and a discussion of the effect of the defaults by hp a m  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value estimates obligations payable by hp a m  now in default and farm accounts receivable and future farm income 
pie chart agricultural operations and leasing beginning on august   we assumed management of our farm operations and all associated income and expenses 
beginning september   we began tracking and reporting our farm operations as a separate business segment to reflect management s analysis  investment decision  and operating performance for this business segment 
currently  approximately of our farm operations are managed through cash lease arrangements with local area farmers whereby we charge a fixed fee  billed semi annually in march and november  to lease our land and the water for agricultural purposes to tenant farmers 
we have a small number of crop share leases  pursuant to which we and the tenant farmer jointly share in the gross revenues generated from the crops grown under a farmer  landlord participation 
the table to the right details a sampling of the crops grown on our farms 
we will continue to review and evaluate ways to enhance the performance of our approximately  acres of farm land through relationships with area farmers 
the following is a map of our farming properties 
map tap participation fee as further described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and use of estimates below and note long term debt and operating lease and note subsequent events to the accompanying financial statements  we agreed to pay hp a m of the tap fees we receive from the next  water taps we sell from and after the original date of the arkansas river agreement 
this is referred to as the tap participation fee  or tpf 
the tpf is payable when we sell water taps and receive funds from such water tap sales or other dispositions of property purchased in the hp a m acquisition 
effective as of september   i hp a m elected to increase the tpf percentage from to and take a corresponding reduction in the number of taps subject to the tpf and ii pursuant to the property management agreement  we began allocating of the net revenues defined as all lease and related income received from the farms less employee expenses  direct expenses for managing the leases and a reasonable overhead allocation paid to hp a m against the tpf 
beginning in june of  hp a m began defaulting on certain promissory notes owed to third parties resulting in a default under the arkansas river agreements 
as a result of hp a m s default  on august   we terminated the property management agreement and stopped allocating of the net revenues to the tpf 
we began implementing our remedies under the arkansas river agreements  including commencing foreclosure procedures on certain farms and flcc shares  and as of august   there remained  water taps subject to the tap participation fee 
subsequent to fiscal year end  additional farms and corresponding flcc shares have been foreclosed upon reducing the remaining water taps subject to the tap participation fee to  additional information on the elections made by hp a m  the terms of the arkansas river agreement  the estimation of the fair value of the tap participation fee liability  the calculation of the percentage of net revenues and the reduction of water taps subject to the tap participation fee is included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates below and in note long term debt and operating lease and note related party transactions to the accompanying financial statements 
approximately of the farms acquired from hp a m were subject to deeds of trust to secure payment of promissory notes owed by hp a m to third parties 
as of the date of this filing  hp a m has defaulted on all of these promissory notes and deeds of trust 
the farms subject to the deeds of trust consist of approximately  acres of farm land and  flcc shares of water rights 
mineral rights on these farms  if any  are owned approximately by hp a m and by us 
as of september  hp a m owed approximately million of principal and accrued interest on the defaulted notes 
we have commenced exercising our remedies under the arkansas river agreement and related agreements  which remedies include  but are not limited to  the right to i foreclose on  shares of pure cycle common stock issued to hp a m and the proceeds therefrom the pledged shares which were pledged by hp a m pursuant to a pledge agreement the seller pledge agreement to secure the payment and performance by hp a m of the promissory notes described above these shares were sold in a foreclosure sale in september  ii reduce the tap participation fee  iii terminate the property management agreement  and iv recover damages caused by the defaults  including certain costs and attorney s fees

during fiscal year four of our farms and one fllc certificate representing water rights only went through foreclosure proceedings due to the defaults by hp a m 
our agreement with hp a m provides for a reduction of the number of water taps subject to the tpf payable to hp a m in the event of the farms or water rights are sold in a foreclosure sale 
we reduced the number of taps by  taps and the discounted present value of the tpf payable by a total of approximately million as a result of the foreclosures 
as of august  there were  taps subject to the tap participation fee 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  an additional three farms and one flcc certificate representing water rights only  collectively including  flcc shares  were foreclosed resulting in a reduction of the number of taps subject to the tpf by an additional  taps approximately million of the tpf  leaving  taps subject to the tap participation fee as of november  sky ranch in we purchased acres of undeveloped land located in unincorporated arapahoe county known as sky ranch 
sky ranch is located directly adjacent to i  miles east of downtown denver  miles north of the lowry range  and miles south of denver international airport 
the financing of the sky ranch acquisition is described in greater detail in note water assets to the accompanying financial statements 
the property includes rights to acre feet of water  has been zoned for residential  commercial and retail uses and may include up to  sfe s 
there is currently no development at sky ranch 
we currently lease the land to an area farmer 
we envision that when development at sky ranch begins  the development will be in the form of entry level housing houses costing less than 
we plan to partner with national home builders developers to develop the sky ranch property 
we are anticipating that the home builder developer will construct infrastructure such as roads  curbs and gutters  and we will construct the necessary water and wastewater systems 
our plan is to provide the market with competitively priced lots that are ready for development together with affordable  sustainable  environmentally sound water and wastewater services 
we anticipate working with the builders developers to bring a product to the denver market that is both affordable and desirable 
although timing for development of this property is unknown  some land development experts believe the entry level housing market is among the most active housing products in the denver metropolitan area 
at full development  the water and wastewater utilities at sky ranch are anticipated to generate in excess of million in tap fee revenue and approximately million annually in wholesale service fee revenue based on current fees and charges 
oil and gas lease on march   we entered into a paid up oil and gas lease the o g lease and surface use and damage agreement the surface use agreement with anadarko e p company  lp anadarko  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko petroleum company 
the o g lease seeks to capitalize on the growing interest in the region s niobrara oil formation 
pursuant to the o g lease  we received an up front payment of  per net mineral leased acre  or  and of gross proceeds royalty less certain taxes from the sale of any oil and gas produced from our property 
in december of the o g lease was purchased by a wholly owned subsidiary of conocophillips company conocophillips 
the o g lease has a term of three years commencing on march  if conocophillips commences drilling and has a producing well on sky ranch or lands pooled or unitized with sky ranch  the o g lease will continue in effect for as long as oil or gas is being produced 
if there is no production by the end of the initial term  conocophillips may extend the o g lease for an additional two years by paying us an up front payment equal to the initial up front payment noted above 
pursuant to the surface use agreement  conocophillips may drill on up to three well pad sites on the sky ranch property covered under the o g lease 
additionally  we will receive  per acre for land that is permanently disturbed for use in the oil and gas exploration and production 
during october three well permit applications were filed 
one permit is for a well to be drilled on the sky ranch property 
the remaining two permits are for wells to be drilled off of sky ranch  but will be drilled into the formation under the sky ranch property 
we have experienced increased water demands for hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells being developed in the niobrara formation around our sky ranch property and the land board s lowry range property 
based on similar horizontal wells developed in the niobrara formation each horizontal well will require between million and million gallons of water to drill and frack  which equates to selling water to between approximately and sfe s 
arapahoe county fairgrounds agreement for water service in  we entered into an agreement for water service the county agreement with the county to design  construct  operate and maintain a water system for  and provide water services to  the county for use at the county s fairgrounds the fairgrounds  which are located west of the lowry range 
pursuant to the county agreement we purchased acre feet of water in further details of the funding arrangements with the county are described in note water assets to the accompanying financial statements 
pursuant to the county agreement we constructed and own a deep water well  a  gallon water tank and pipelines to transport water to the fairgrounds 
the construction of these items was completed in our fiscal  and we began providing water service to the county in graphic well enhancement and recovery systems in january  we  along with two other parties  formed well enhancement and recovery systems  llc well enhancement llc  to develop a new deep water well enhancement tool and process which we believe will increase the efficiency of wells into the denver basin groundwater formation 
in fiscal  the well enhancement tool and process was completed and tested on two deep water wells developed by an area water provider with favorable results 
according to results from studies performed by an independent hydro geologist  the well enhancement tool effectively increased the production of the two test wells by and when compared to that of nearby wells developed in similar formations at similar depths 
based on the positive results of the test wells  we continue to refine the process of enhancing deep water wells and are marketing the tool to area water providers 
on april   we and the other remaining owner of well enhancement llc acquired the third partner s rd interest in well enhancement llc 
following the acquisition  the remaining partners each hold a interest in well enhancement llc 
during fiscal our tool was used in wells 
paradise water supply in we acquired the conditional rights to build a  acre foot reservoir to store colorado river tributary water and a right of way permit from the us bureau of land management for property at the dam and reservoir site collectively known as our paradise water supply 
due to the significant development costs of water assets along the western slope and agreements with other western slope water interests  the use of our paradise water supply is limited to opportunities along the western slope 
the conditional water rights diligence application was completed in october and we were able to negotiate a finding of diligence and continuation of the conditional water rights through october in order to obtain a finding of reasonable diligence at the next diligence proceeding for the paradise conditional water rights in october  we are required to i select an alternate reservoir site  ii file an application with the water court for water division to change the place of storage  iii identify specific end users and places of use for the paradise conditional water rights within the colorado river basin in colorado  excluding the gunnison river basin  and iv identify specific source s of the water rights for use 
we do not intend to spend the resources needed to find an alternative reservoir site without a specific use for the water 
we have been unable to find potential customers for this water and cannot be certain that any customer will commit to use the water within the next year 
since we do not have a customer that will commit to use the water and will not commit the resources necessary to move the reservoir site without a customer  we are expecting to lose the conditional water rights 
accordingly  we deemed the paradise water supply to be fully impaired and an impairment of million was recorded in the fiscal financial statements 
we are currently working on options to dispose of our paradise water supply asset 
revenues we generate revenues through two separate lines of businesses including our wholesale water and wastewater business and our farming operations  which are described below 
wholesale water and wastewater business we generate revenues through our wholesale water and wastewater segment predominately from three sources i monthly service and contract delivery fees  ii one time water and wastewater tap fees and construction fees  and iii consulting fees 
our revenue sources and how we account for them are described in greater detail below 
we typically negotiate the payment terms for tap fees  construction fees  and other water and wastewater service fees with our wholesale customers as a component of our service agreements prior to construction of the project 
i monthly service fees monthly wholesale water usage fees are assessed to our customers based on actual metered deliveries to their end use customers each month 
water usage fees are based on a tiered pricing structure that provides for higher prices as customers use greater amounts of water 
water usage pricing is capped at the average of the prices charged by the same three surrounding water providers used as the basis for water tap fees 
the district has not changed its water usage fees since july  the water usage fees are noted below in table b table b tiered water usage pricing structure price per thousand gallons amount of consumption base charge per sfe gallons to  gallons  gallons to  gallons  gallons to  gallons  gallons and above the figures in table b reflect the amounts charged to the district s end use customers 
in exchange for providing water service to the district s lowry range customers  we receive of the usage charges received by the district relating to water services after deducting the required royalty to the land board described above at rangeview water supply and lowry range land board royalties 
in exchange for providing wastewater services  we receive of the district s monthly wastewater service fees  as well as the right to use or sell the reclaimed water 
currently the district charges its wastewater customers based on a monthly fee of per sfe plus a per thousand gallons treated usage fee 
there have not been any changes to the pricing structure since july  in addition to the tiered water usage pricing structure we currently charge a hydrant rate of per thousand gallons 
during fiscal our sales to the fracking industry were charged at the hydrant rate 
beginning october we began charging a water rate to the fracking industry of per thousand gallons for export water sales 
we also collect other immaterial fees and charges from customers and other users to cover miscellaneous administrative and service expenses  such as application fees  review fees and permit fees 
ii water and wastewater tap fees and construction fees tap fees are paid by developers in advance of construction activities and are non refundable 
tap fees are typically used to fund construction of the wholesale facilities and defray the acquisition costs of obtaining water rights 
pursuant to the rangeview water agreements the district s rates and charges to end use customers may not exceed the average of similar rates and charges of three nearby water providers 
despite modest increases in the water tap fees at these three nearby water providers  the district s water tap fees and wastewater tap fees have remained unchanged at  per sfe and  per sfe  respectively  since the district last increased water tap fees on july   by  to  per sfe  which was a increase over the water tap fee 
in exchange for providing water service to the district s customers customers on the lowry range  we receive of the district s tap fees after deducting the required royalty to the land board described above 
in exchange for providing wastewater services  we receive of the district s wastewater tap fees 
construction fees are fees we receive  typically in advance  from developers for us to build certain infrastructure such as special facilities which are normally the responsibility of the developer 
iii consulting fees consulting fees are fees we receive  typically on a monthly basis  from municipalities and area water providers along the i corridor  for system management and maintenance 
farming operations we lease our farms to local area farmers on both cash and crop share lease basis 
our cash lease farmers are charged a fixed fee  billed semi annually in march and november 
during the november billing cycle our cash lease billings include either a discount or a premium adjustment based on actual water deliveries by the flcc 
our crop share lease fees are based on actual crop yields and are received upon the sale of the crops 
all fees are estimated and recognized ratably on a monthly basis 
significant customers our wholesale water and wastewater sales to the district pursuant to the rangeview water agreements accounted for   and of our total water revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the district has one significant customer  the ridgeview youth services center ridgeview 
pursuant to our rangeview water agreements with the district  we are providing water to ridgeview on behalf of the district 
ridgeview accounted for  and of our total water revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively 
our wholesale water sales indirectly to conocophillips accounted for of our total water revenues for the fiscal year ended august  our projected operations this section should be read in conjunction with item a risk factors 
along the colorado front range  there are over water providers with varying needs for replacement and new water supplies 
we believe we are well positioned to assist certain of these providers in meeting their current and future water needs 
we design  construct and operate our existing and future water and wastewater facilities using advanced water purification and wastewater treatment technologies which allow us to use our water supplies in an efficient and environmentally sustainable manner 
we plan to develop our water and wastewater systems in stages to efficiently meet demands in our service areas  thereby reducing the amount of up front capital costs required for construction of facilities 
we use third party contractors to construct our facilities as needed 
we employ licensed water and wastewater operators to operate our water and wastewater systems 
as our systems expand  we expect to hire additional personnel to operate our systems  which include water production  treatment  testing  storage  distribution  metering  billing  and operations management 
our water and wastewater systems conjunctively use surface and groundwater supplies and storage of raw water and highly treated effluent supplies to provide a balanced sustainable water supply for our wholesale customers and their end use customers 
integrating conservation practices and incentives together with effective water reuse demonstrates our commitment to providing environmentally responsible  sustainable water and wastewater services 
water supplies and water storage reservoirs are competitively sought throughout the west and along the front range of colorado 
we believe regional cooperation among area water providers in developing new water supplies  water storage  and transmission and distribution systems  provides the most cost effective way of expanding and enhancing service capacities for area water providers 
we continue to discuss developing water supplies and water storage opportunities with area water providers 
we expect the development of our rangeview water supply to require a significant number of high capacity deep water wells 
we anticipate drilling separate wells into each of the three principal aquifers located beneath the lowry range 
each well is intended to deliver water to central water treatment facilities for treatment prior to delivery to customers 
development of our lowry range surface water supplies will require facilities to divert surface water to storage reservoirs to be located on the lowry range and treatment facilities to treat the water prior to introduction into our distribution systems 
surface water diversion facilities will be designed with capacities to divert the surface water when available particularly during seasonal events such as spring run off and summer storms for storage in reservoirs to be constructed on the lowry range 
based on preliminary engineering estimates  the full build out of water facilities including diversion structures  transmission pipelines  reservoirs  and water treatment facilities on the lowry range will cost in excess of million  based on current costs  and will accommodate water service to customers located on and outside the lowry range 
we expect this build out to occur over an extended period of time  and we expect that tap fees will be sufficient to fund the infrastructure costs 
our denver based supplies are a valuable  locally available resource located near the point of use 
this enables us to incrementally develop infrastructure to produce  treat and deliver water to customers based on their growing demands 
adding our locally available supplies to our intermediate and longer term supplies from the arkansas river balances both current and ongoing supplies to meet the growing water demands in the front range market 
in order to use our arkansas river water for municipal purposes  we must file a change of use application with the colorado water court 
this will likely be a lengthy process and require a substantial amount of capital for legal and engineering services 
if we successfully change the use of our water rights to include municipal uses  we would then need to construct a mile pipeline  and water treatment and pumping facilities  from southeastern colorado to the denver metropolitan area at an estimated cost of over million  based on current costs 
since acquiring the arkansas river supply  we have investigated various pipeline alignments and potential partnerships for construction of these facilities 
we do not plan on starting this process in the near term and anticipate that the tap fees and usage fees we generate from taps sold utilizing our water rights located along the front range  along with funding from other pipeline partners  will be sufficient to fund the water delivery facilities when the water is needed along the front range 
although we have not yet filed a change of use application  we are working with the flcc and other interested parties in the arkansas river valley to mitigate any adverse impacts to the local communities and to make investments and decisions on farming operations which benefit continued agricultural operations as well as providing new municipal water supplies for the front range 
we are conducting a rotational crop study program and participating in discussions with area interests including the lower arkansas valley super ditch super ditch  which is a group of arkansas valley irrigators who have assembled to study alternatives to traditional buy and dry agricultural to municipal water transfers 
during fiscal we  along with the district  began developing and integrating the eccv system of wells through the rehabilitation of a number of existing wells and the addition of piping to service fracking operations both on and off of the lowry range 
in order to fully meet the anticipated demand by these operations during fiscal we may continue to invest in this system to maximize our production and to divert our water to the locations we need to reach 
we anticipate expanding capacity in our system from approximately  gallons per day to approximately million gallons per day during fiscal the district is currently in the process of negotiating terms for the development of the wise project 
this project is being established for the purpose of extending renewable water sources held by the denver and aurora water districts to the south metro water providers  including the district 
this system will add an additional vital source of water to our system  which in the long term will be an essential component of the district s system and will enable us to continue to meet the demands or our customers on a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner 
through our funding agreement with the district we may participate in this project during fiscal we are exploring development of our sky ranch property including evaluating possible joint venture opportunities whereby we will contribute the property  a portion of the development funds  and build the water and wastewater infrastructure for housing and commercial development of the property 
the timing for us to begin developing the property is largely dependent on the denver real estate market and interest we receive from home builders and developers 
while the denver area s housing market has strengthened in recent years we are not able to determine when we expect to begin development of the property 
we continue to develop our farming operations seeking to increase crop yields and to balance our cash and crop share leases in order to maximize profits while leveraging our risks 
we plan on adding sprinkler irrigation to a few of our farms during fiscal in order to better utilize our water supplies and increase crop yields 
we are also negotiating with area farmers to optimize our lease structure 
water and growth in colorado after experiencing a weak economy through  much like that of the us as a whole  colorado began recovering during the key drivers in our business model are housing starts from september to september the annual housing starts increased by

colorado added an estimated  jobs from august to august population the denver regional council of governments drcog  a voluntary association of over county and municipal governments in the denver metropolitan area  continues to estimate that the denver metropolitan area population will increase by about from today s million people to million people by the year a statewide water supply initiative report by the colorado water conservation board estimates that the south platte river basin  which includes the denver metropolitan region  will grow from a current population of million to million by the year  while the state s population will increase from million to million 
demand approximately of the state s projected population increase is anticipated to occur within the south platte river basin 
significant increases in colorado s population  particularly in the denver metro region and other areas in the water short south platte river basin  together with increasing agricultural  recreational  and environmental water demands will intensify competition for water supplies 
the estimated population increases are expected to result in demands for water services in excess of the current capabilities of municipal service providers  especially during drought conditions 
supply the statewide water supply initiative estimates that population growth in the denver region and the south platte river basin will result in additional water supply demands of over  acre feet by the year  which must be met with new water sources 
development colorado law requires property developers to demonstrate they have sufficient water supplies for their proposed projects before rezoning or annexation applications will be considered 
these factors indicate that water and availability of water will continue to be critical to growth prospects for the region and the state  and that competition for available sources of water will continue to intensify 
we focus the marketing of our water supplies and services to developers and homebuilders that are active along the colorado front range as well as other area water providers in need of additional supplies 
colorado s future water supply needs will be met through conservation  reuse and the development of new supplies 
the district s rules and regulations for water and wastewater service call for adherence to strict conservation measures  including low flow water fixtures  high efficiency appliances  and advanced irrigation control devices 
additionally  our systems are designed and constructed using a dual pipe water distribution system to segregate the delivery of high quality potable drinking water to our local governmental entities and their end use customers through one system and a second system to supply raw or reclaimed water for irrigation demands 
about one half of the water used by a typical denver area residential water customer is used for outdoor landscape and lawn irrigation 
we believe that raw or reclaimed water supplies provide the lowest cost  most environmentally sustainable water for outdoor irrigation 
we expect our systems to include an extensive water reclamation system  in which essentially all effluent water from wastewater treatment plants will be reused to meet non potable water demands 
our dual distribution systems demonstrate our commitment to environmentally responsible water management policies in our water short region 
competition we negotiate individual service agreements with our governmental customers and with their developers and or homebuilders  to design  construct and operate water and wastewater systems and to provide services to end use customers of governmental entities and to commercial and industrial customers 
these service agreements address all aspects of the development of the water and wastewater systems including i the purchase of water and wastewater taps in exchange for our obligation to construct certain wholesale facilities  ii the establishment of payment terms  timing  capacity and location of special facilities if any  and iii specific terms related to our provision of ongoing water and wastewater services to our local governmental customers as well as the governmental entity s end use customers 
although we have exclusive long term water and wastewater service contracts for  acres of the  acre lowry range pursuant to our service agreement with the district  providing water and wastewater services to areas other than sky ranch and the majority of the lowry range  is subject to competition 
moreover  others  including the land board  have attempted to challenge  thus far without success  our exclusive rights to service the lowry range 
see item a risk factors and item legal proceedings below 
alternate sources of water are available  principally from other private parties  such as farmers or others owning water rights that have historically been used for agriculture  and from municipalities seeking to annex new development areas in order to increase their tax base 
our principal competition in areas close to the lowry range is the city of aurora 
principal factors affecting competition for potential purchasers of our arkansas river water and export water include the availability of water for the particular purpose  the cost of delivering the water to the desired location including the cost of required taps  and the reliability of the water supply during drought periods 
the water assets we own and have the exclusive right to use have a supply capacity of  sfe units  and we believe they provide us with a significant competitive advantage along the front range 
our legal rights to the rangeview water supply have been confirmed for municipal use and a significant portion of our water supply is close to denver area water users 
our pricing structure is competitive and our water portfolio is well balanced with senior surface water rights  groundwater rights  storage capacity and reclaimed water supplies 
environmental  health and safety regulation provision of water and wastewater services is subject to regulation under the federal safe drinking water act  the clean water act  related state laws  and federal and state regulations issued under these laws 
these laws and regulations establish criteria and standards for drinking water and for wastewater discharges 
in addition  we are subject to federal and state laws and other regulations relating to solid waste disposal and certain other aspects of our operations 
environmental compliance issues may arise in the normal course of operations or as a result of regulatory changes 
we attempt to align capital budgeting and expenditures to address these issues in a timely manner 
safe drinking water act the safe drinking water act establishes criteria and procedures for the us environmental protection agency the epa to develop national quality standards for drinking water 
regulations issued pursuant to the safe drinking water act and its amendments set standards on the amount of certain microbial and chemical contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water 
the state of colorado has assumed primary responsibility for enforcing the standards established by the safe drinking water act and has adopted the colorado primary drinking water standards ccr 
current requirements for drinking water are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations as we have made and are making investments to meet existing water quality standards 
in the future  we might be required to change our method of treating drinking water and make additional capital investments if additional regulations become effective 
the federal groundwater rule became effective december  this rule requires additional testing of water from well sources and under certain circumstances requires demonstration and maintenance of effective disinfection 
in  colorado adopted article to the colorado primary drinking water standards to establish monitoring and compliance criteria for the groundwater rule 
we have implemented measures to comply with the groundwater rule 
clean water act the clean water act regulates wastewater discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities and storm water discharges into lakes  rivers  streams  and groundwater 
the state of colorado has assumed primary responsibility for enforcing the standards established by the federal clean water act for wastewater discharges from domestic water and wastewater treatment facilities and has adopted the colorado water quality control act and related regulations 
it is our policy to obtain and maintain all required permits and approvals for discharges from our water and wastewater facilities and to comply with all conditions of those permits and other regulatory requirements 
a program is in place to monitor facilities for compliance with permitting  monitoring and reporting for wastewater discharges 
from time to time  discharge violations might occur which might result in fines and penalties  but we have no reason to believe that any such fines or penalties are pending or will be assessed 
in the future  we anticipate changing our method of treating wastewater  which will require future additional capital investments  as additional regulations become effective 
we anticipate spending between  and  during calendar year for improvements at our wastewater treatment facilities necessary to maintain compliant operations in light of more stringent discharge criteria for ammonia nitrogen and chlorine residual 
solid waste disposal the handling and disposal of residuals and solid waste generated from water and wastewater treatment facilities is governed by federal and state laws and regulations 
we have a program in place to monitor our facilities for compliance with regulatory requirements  and we do not anticipate that costs associated with our handling and disposal of waste material from our water and wastewater operations will have a material impact on our business or financial condition

these risks include those listed below and may include additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently do not believe are material 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business could be materially adversely affected 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report  including the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto 
we are dependent on the housing market and development in our targeted service areas for future revenues 
providing wholesale water service using our colorado front range water supplies is our principal source of future revenue 
the timing and amount of these revenues will depend significantly on housing developments being built near our water assets 
the development of these areas is not within our control  and there can be no assurance that development will occur or that water sales will occur on acceptable terms or in the amounts or time required for us to support our costs of operation 
in the event wholesale water sales are not forthcoming or development on the lowry range  sky ranch or other developments in our targeted service area is delayed indefinitely  we would need to incur additional short or long term debt obligations or seek to sell additional equity to generate operating capital  and there are no assurances that we would be successful in obtaining additional operating capital 
after several years of significant declines in new home construction  there have been positive market gains in the colorado housing market in however  if the downturn in the homebuilding and credit markets return or if the national economy weakens and economic concerns intensify  it could have a significant negative impact on our business and financial condition 
development on the lowry range is not within our control and is subject to obstacles 
development on the lowry range is controlled by the land board  which consists of a five person citizen group representing education  agriculture  local government and natural resources  plus one at large commissioner  each appointed for a four year term by the colorado governor and approved by the colorado senate 
the land board s focus with respect to issues such as development and conservation on the lowry range tends to change as membership on the land board changes 
in addition  there are often significant delays on the adoption and implementation of plans with respect to property administered by the land board because the process involves many constituencies with diverse interests 
in the event water sales are not forthcoming or development of the lowry range is delayed  we may incur additional short or long term debt obligations or seek to sell additional equity to generate operating capital 
further  the land board may not develop large portions of the lowry range which would significantly limit our ability to utilize the non export water specifically reserved for use on the lowry range 
because of the prior use of the lowry range as a military facility  environmental clean up may be required prior to development  including the removal of unexploded ordnance 
the us army corps of engineers have been conducting unexploded ordnance removal activities at the lowry range for the past years 
continued activities are dependent on federal appropriations  and the army corps of engineers has no assurance from year to year of such appropriations for its activities at the lowry range 
we and the district have been involved in ongoing disputes with the land board regarding our rights and obligations with respect to our rangeview water supply  and such disputes may continue to arise and may not be resolved in our favor 
our rangeview water supply rights are subject to terms of the lease between the land board and the district 
the lease was entered into in prior to any development of the lowry range or of areas outside the lowry range that utilize our export water 
the terms of the lease did not fully anticipate the specific circumstances of development that have arisen and may not clearly delineate rights and responsibilities for the forms of transactions that may arise in the future 
we are currently involved in both an arbitration proceeding and a lawsuit with the land board to resolve disputes under the lease 
see the next two risk factors 
moreover  since the lease extends until  additional disputes may arise 
an unfavorable resolution of these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we filed a lawsuit against the land board claiming the land board breached and will breach agreements entered into by the land board and us in connection with a settlement  and we may not be successful 
on december   we and the district filed a lawsuit against the land board  claiming that the land board breached  and will breach  agreements entered into by the land board with us and the district in connection with a settlement agreement with respect to our rangeview water supply 
those agreements include the lease between the land board and the district and the service agreement between us and the district 
the land board issued a request for proposal that included a draft lease agreement related to oil and gas rights at the land board s lowry range and subsequently entered into an oil and gas lease which we believe does not adequately address or protect the district s exclusive right to provide water service to the lowry range or our rights as the district s exclusive service provider 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the lawsuit or that disputes under the lease will not reoccur 
an unfavorable decision in this lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on the value of our rangeview water supply  our business  operating results and financial condition 
we  the district and the land board entered into an arbitration agreement pursuant to which the parties have agreed to submit certain counterclaims under the lease to binding arbitration 
in connection with the lawsuit we and the district filed against the land board  as described above  the land board raised certain counterclaims related to operational disputes under the lease  which the parties have agreed to submit to binding arbitration 
an unfavorable outcome in the arbitration could increase our costs of operations and have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
hp a m filed a law suit against us alleging breaches of representations made in connection with the arkansas river agreement 
hp a m initiated a lawsuit against us in district court  city and county of denver  state of colorado on february  alleging breaches of representations made in connection with the arkansas river agreement 
hp a m s claims relate to the issues currently being litigated between us and the land board regarding our exclusive right to provide water service to the land board s lowry range property 
an unfavorable decision in our lawsuit against the land board discussed above could adversely affect the decision in this lawsuit 
an adverse decision in the hp a m lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating  results and financial condition 
the district s rights under the lease have been challenged by third parties 
the district s rights under the lease have been challenged by third parties in the past  most recently in when the city of aurora the city applied for the right to store water in certain reservoir sites on the lowry range that had already been adjudicated by the district and the land board  which adjudications allow us to use the reservoir sites for our rangeview water supply 
in that proceeding  a developer sought to support the city by filing an amicus brief in which the developer asserted  contrary to the terms of the lease  that the developer might not be required to obtain water and wastewater service exclusively from the district for planned development on the lowry range 
the city s application was denied 
however  there can be no assurance that the district s rights under the lease will not be challenged again  which could require us to commence potentially expensive litigation to enforce our rights as the district s service provider to the adjudicated reservoir sites and to provide wholesale water and wastewater service to the lowry range 
see also risk factor we filed a lawsuit against the land board claiming the land board breached and will breach agreements entered into by the land board and us in connection with a settlement  and we may not be successful 
our operations are affected by local politics and governmental procedures which are beyond our control 
we operate in a highly political environment 
we market our water rights to municipalities and other governmental entities run by elected or politically appointed officials 
our principal competitors are municipalities seeking to expand their sales tax base and other water districts 
various constituencies  including our competitors  developers  environmental groups  conservation groups  and agricultural interests  have competing agendas with respect to the development of water rights in colorado  which means that decisions affecting our business are based on many factors other than economic and business considerations 
additional risks associated with dealing with governmental entities include turnover of elected and appointed officials  changes in policies from election to election  and a lack of institutional history in these entities concerning their prior courses of dealing with the company 
we spend significant time and resources educating elected officials  local authorities and others regarding our water rights and the benefits of contracting with us 
political concerns and governmental procedures and policies may hinder or delay our ability to enter into service agreements or develop our water rights 
while we have worked to reduce the political risks in our business through our participation as the service provider for the district in regional cooperative resource programs  such as the smwa and its wise partnership with denver water and aurora water  as well as education and communication efforts and community involvement  there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
our lowry range surface water rights are conditional decrees and require findings of reasonable diligence 
our surface water interests and reservoir sites at the lowry range are conditionally decreed and are subject to a finding of reasonable diligence from the colorado water court every six years 
to arrive at a finding of reasonable diligence  the water court must determine that we continue to diligently pursue the development of said water rights 
if the water court is unable to make such a finding  we could lose the water right under review 
during fiscal  the lowry range conditional decrees were granted their first review by the water court which determined that we and the district met the diligence criteria 
the water court entered a finding of reasonable diligence on the lowry range surface water decrees on february  our next diligence period will be in february if the water court does not make a determination of reasonable diligence in  it would materially adversely impact the value of our interests in the rangeview surface water supply 
in order to utilize our arkansas river water  we must apply for a change of use with the water court and this may take several years to complete 
the change of use of our arkansas river water requires a favorable ruling by the water court  which could take several years and be a costly and contentious effort since it is anticipated that many parties will oppose the change of use and the transfer of the water 
there are several conditions which must be satisfied prior to our receiving a change of use decree for transfer of our arkansas river water 
one condition that we must satisfy is a showing of anti speculation in which we  as the applicant  must demonstrate that we have contractual obligations to provide water service to customers prior to the water court ruling on the transfer of a water right 
the water court is also expected to limit the transfer to the consumptive use portion of the water right and to address changing the historic use of the water from agricultural uses to other uses such as municipal and industrial use 
we expect to face opposition to any consumptive use calculations of the historic agricultural uses of this water 
the water court may impose conditions on our transfer of the water rights such as requiring us to mitigate the loss of the farming tax base  imposing re vegetation requirements to convert soils from irrigated to non irrigated  and imposing water quality measures 
any such conditions will likely increase the cost of transferring the water rights 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to develop our water rights  in particular the arkansas river water 
development of water rights requires a substantial capital investment 
we anticipate financing water and wastewater systems primarily through the sale of water taps and water delivery charges to our customers 
however  we cannot assure you that these sources of cash will be sufficient to cover our capital costs 
moreover  the development of the arkansas river water will require a pipeline or other infrastructure to deliver the water to the front range  which is anticipated to cost over million  based on current costs 
we likely would be required to partner with others to finance a project of this magnitude  and there is no assurance we would be able to obtain the financing necessary to develop our arkansas river water 
hp a m has defaulted on promissory notes secured by deeds of trust on our arkansas river properties and water rights and if we are unsuccessful in curing the defaults  we will lose some of our properties and the water rights associated with such properties 
approximately of the properties we acquired from hp a m are subject to promissory notes owed by hp a m to third parties with principal and accrued interest totaling million at august  these promissory notes are secured by deeds of trust on our arkansas river properties and water rights 
hp a m has defaulted on all of the notes 
although we are not legally responsible for paying these notes  if we do not cure the defaults  we would lose of the arkansas river properties and a comparable percentage of the water rights 
we foreclosed on the pledged shares  consisting of million shares of our common stock owned by hp a m which were pledged to us to secure the promissory notes 
the foreclosure sale yielded million which is not enough to cure all of the promissory notes 
we have been acquiring the promissory notes to protect our arkansas river properties 
as of the filing date  we have successfully acquired approximately million of the notes payable by hp a m in exchange for a combination of cash and secured notes 
the notes we have issued are secured by the same arkansas river properties and water rights and generally have a five year term  bear interest at an annual rate of and require semi annual payments with a straight line amortization schedule 
we may not be successful in negotiating acquisitions of all of the notes 
if we are unable to acquire all of the notes or to pay our notes as they become due  we could lose the property and water rights securing the unacquired hp a m notes and securing our notes in foreclosure proceedings 
the loss of the arkansas river properties and water rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
hp a m attempted to acquire four of the arkansas river properties  which were subject to promissory notes and deeds of trust defaulted on by hp a m  without paying us for the properties 
we have purchased most of the hp a m notes and deeds of trust defaulted on by hp a m and started foreclosure proceedings to clear title to the properties and obtain title to any mineral rights owned by hp a m as additional collateral to recover the amounts we have had to pay to cure hp a m s defaults 
hp a m attempted to redeem four of the properties after the foreclosure sales were completed and sought a court order preventing the public trustee from issuing us the deeds to the properties as the successful bidder in the foreclosure sales 
the court ruled against hp a m on november  however  hp a m has days to appeal the judgment 
see item legal proceedings for details regarding this lawsuit 
if hp a m appeals the judgment and is successful  we could lose these four properties  which have a market value of approximately  hp a m would be liable to us for this loss pursuant to the terms of the arkansas river agreement  but there can be no assurance that we would recover such damages 
our net losses may continue and we may not have sufficient liquidity to pursue our business objectives 
we have experienced significant net losses  our cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to fund our operations in the past and we have been required to raise debt and equity capital to remain in operation 
since  we have raised million to support our operations through i the issuance of million of common stock includes the issuance of stock pursuant to the exercise of options  net of expenses and ii the issuance of million of convertible debt  which was converted to common stock on january  our ability to fund our operational needs and meet our business objectives will depend on our ability to generate cash from future operations 
we currently have a limited number of customers 
if our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are not sufficient to fund our operations and the significant capital expenditure requirements to build our water delivery systems  we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities  or seek to obtain additional debt or equity capital 
recent economic conditions and disruptions have caused substantial volatility in capital markets  including credit markets and the banking industry  and have increased the cost and significantly reduced the availability of financing  which may continue or worsen in the future 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the rates the district is allowed to charge customers on the lowry range are limited by the lease with the land board and our contract with the district and may not be sufficient to cover our costs of construction and operation 
the prices charged by the district for water service on the lowry range are subject to pricing regulations set forth in the lease with the land board 
both the tap fees and usage rates and charges are capped at the average of the rates of three nearby water providers 
annually the district surveys the tap fees and rates of the three nearby providers and the district may adjust tap fees and rates and charges based on the average of those charged by this group  and we receive of whatever the district charges its customers 
our costs associated with the construction of water delivery systems and the production  treatment and delivery of water are subject to market conditions and other factors  which may increase at a significantly greater rate than the fees we receive from the district 
factors beyond our control and which cannot be predicted  such as government regulations  insurance and labor markets  drought  water contamination and severe weather conditions  like tornadoes and floods  may result in additional labor and material costs that may not be recoverable under the current rate structure 
either increased customer demand or increased water conservation may also impact the overall cost of our operations 
if the costs for construction and operation of our wholesale water services  including the cost of extracting our groundwater  exceed our revenues  we would be providing service to the district for use at the lowry range at a loss 
the district may petition the land board for rate increases  however  there can be no assurance that the land board would approve a rate increase request 
further  even if a rate increase were approved  it might not be granted in a timely manner or in an amount sufficient to cover the expenses for which the rate increase was sought 
our construction of water and wastewater projects may expose us to certain completion  performance and financial risks 
we intend to rely on independent contractors to construct our water and wastewater facilities 
these construction activities may involve risks  including shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor relations disputes  weather interference  engineering  environmental  permitting or geological problems and unanticipated cost increases 
these issues could give rise to delays  cost overruns or performance deficiencies  or otherwise adversely affect the construction or operation of our water and wastewater delivery systems 
in addition  we may experience quality problems in the construction of our systems and facilities  including equipment failures 
we cannot assure you that we will not face claims from customers or others regarding product quality and installation of equipment placed in service by contractors 
certain of our contracts may be fixed price contracts  in which we may bear all or a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns 
under these fixed price contracts  contract prices are established in part based on fixed  firm subcontractor quotes on contracts and on cost and scheduling estimates 
these estimates may be based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other issues 
if these subcontractor quotations or cost estimates prove inaccurate  or if circumstances change  cost overruns may occur  and our financial results would be negatively impacted 
in many cases  the incurrence of these additional costs would not be within our control 
we may have contracts in which we guarantee project completion by a scheduled date 
at times  we may guarantee that the project  when completed  will achieve certain performance standards 
if we fail to complete the project as scheduled  or if we fail to meet guaranteed performance standards  we may be held responsible for cost impacts and or penalties to the customer resulting from any delay or for the costs to alter the project to achieve the performance standards 
to the extent that these events occur and are not due to circumstances for which the customer accepts responsibility or cannot be mitigated by performance bonds or the provisions of our agreements with contractors  the total costs of the project would exceed our original estimates and our financial results would be negatively impacted 
our customers may require us to secure performance and completion bonds for certain contracts and projects 
the market environment for surety companies has become more risk averse 
we secure performance and completion bonds for our contracts from these surety companies 
to the extent we are unable to obtain bonds  we may not be awarded new contracts 
we cannot assure you that we can secure performance and completion bonds when required 
design  construction or system failures could result in injury to third parties or damage to property 
any losses that exceed claims against our contractors  the performance bonds and our insurance limits at such facilities could result in claims against us 
in addition  if there is a customer dispute regarding performance of our services  the customer may decide to delay or withhold payment to us 
we have a limited number of employees and may not be able to manage the increasing demands of our expanding operations 
we have a limited number of employees to administer our existing assets  interface with applicable governmental bodies  market our services and plan for the construction and development of our future assets 
we may not be able to maximize the value of our water assets because of our limited manpower 
we depend significantly on the services of mark w 
harding  our president and chief financial officer 
the loss of mr 
harding would cause a significant interruption of our operations 
the success of our future business development and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities depends on our ability to attract and retain additional experienced and qualified persons to operate and manage our business 
state regulations set the training  experience and qualification standards required for our employees to operate specific water and wastewater facilities 
failure to find state certified and qualified employees to support the operation of our facilities could put us at risk for  among other things  regulatory penalties including fines and suspension of operations  operational errors at the facilities  improper billing and collection processes  and loss of contracts and revenues 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully manage our assets and our growth 
we may be adversely affected by any future decision by the colorado public utilities commission to regulate us as a public utility 
the colorado public utilities commission cpuc regulates investor owned water companies operating for the purpose of supplying water to the public 
the cpuc regulates many aspects of public utilities operations  including establishing water rates and fees  initiating inspections  enforcement and compliance activities and assisting consumers with complaints 
we do not believe we are a public utility under colorado law 
we currently provide services by contract mainly to the district  which supplies the public 
quasi municipal metropolitan districts  such as the district  are exempt by statute from regulation by the cpuc 
however  the cpuc could attempt to regulate us as a public utility 
if this were to occur  we might incur significant expense challenging the cpuc s assertion of jurisdiction  and we may be unsuccessful 
in the future  existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities 
if we become regulated as a public utility  our ability to generate profits could be limited and we might incur significant costs associated with regulatory compliance 
conflicts of interest may arise relating to the operation of the district 
our officers and employees constitute a majority of the directors of the district 
pure cycle  along with our officers and employees and one unrelated individual  own the acres that constitute the district 
we have made loans to the district to fund its operations 
at august   total principal and interest owed to us by the district was  pursuant to our service agreement with the district for the provision of water services  the district retains of the revenues from the sale of water to its end use customers on the lowry range 
proceeds from the fee collections will initially be used to repay the district s obligations to us  but after these loans are repaid  the district is not required to use the funds to benefit pure cycle 
we have received benefits from our activities undertaken in conjunction with the district  but conflicts may arise between our interests and those of the district  and with our officers who are acting in dual capacities in negotiating contracts to which both we and the district are parties 
we expect that the district will expand when more properties are developed and become part of the district  and our officers acting as directors of the district will have fiduciary obligations to those other constituents 
there can be no assurance that all conflicts will be resolved in the best interests of pure cycle and its shareholders 
in addition  other landowners coming into the district will be eligible to vote and to serve as directors of the district 
there can be no assurances that our officers and employees will remain as directors of the district or that the actions of a subsequently elected board would not have an adverse impact on our operations 
water quality standards are subject to regulatory change 
we must provide water that meets all federal and state regulatory water quality standards and operate our water and wastewater facilities in accordance with these standards 
future changes in regulations governing the supply of drinking water and treatment of wastewater may have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
with respect to service of customers on the lowry range  the district s rates might not be sufficient to cover the cost of compliance with additional or more stringent requirements 
if the cost of compliance were to increase  we anticipate that the rates of the nearby water providers that the district uses to establish its rates and charges would increase to reflect these cost increases  thereby allowing the district to increase its rates and charges 
however  there can be no assurance that these water providers would raise their rates in an amount that would be sufficient to enable the district and us to cover any increased compliance costs 
in october  the water quality control division of the colorado department of public health and environment advised us of proposed changes to the discharge permit for the district s coal creek wastewater reclamation facility 
the revised permit requires compliance with effluent ammonia limitations  use of e 
coli rather than fecal coliform as an indicator of effluent disinfection efficacy  and a more stringent lower effluent chlorine residual limitation 
the revised permit requires us to comply with the new criteria by october although we anticipate being able to comply with the revised permit  there can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with future requirements or that the cost of such compliance will be covered by the rate structure required by the rangeview water agreements 
contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from naturally occurring compounds  pollution from man made sources and intentional sabotage 
our land at sky ranch and a portion of the lowry range have been leased for oil and gas exploration and development 
such exploration and development could expose us to additional contamination risks 
in addition  we handle certain hazardous materials at our water treatment facilities  primarily sodium hypochlorite 
any failure of our operation of the facilities or any contamination of our supplies  including sewage spills  noncompliance with water quality standards  hazardous materials leaks and spills  and similar events could expose us to environmental liabilities  claims and litigation costs 
if any of these events occur  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the supply from another source or treat the contaminated supply 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully manage these issues  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs could assert personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
although we have not been a party to any environmental or pollution related lawsuits  such lawsuits have increased in frequency in recent years 
if we are subject to an environmental or pollution related lawsuit  we might incur significant legal costs  and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties 
our insurance policies may not cover or provide sufficient coverage for the costs of these claims 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and weather conditions which could affect demand for our water service and our revenues 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our local governmental customers and their end use customers and to continue our expansion efforts 
conditions beyond our control may interfere with our water supply sources 
drought and overuse may limit the availability of water 
these factors might adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 
additionally  cool and wet weather  as well as drought restrictions and our customers conservation efforts  may reduce consumption demands  also adversely affecting our revenue and earnings 
furthermore  freezing weather may contribute to water transmission interruptions caused by pipe and main breakage 
if we experience an interruption in our water supply  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with cooling systems  irrigation systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
if temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected or there is more rainfall than expected  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 
sales to the fracking industry could be curtailed or eliminated in the future 
our water sales are highly concentrated with one company providing frack services to the oil and gas industry on and around the lowry range and our sky ranch property 
regulations  fracking technologies  and the success of the wells are conditions that could limit or eliminate our sales to this customer base as well as renewals of our oil and gas leases  if any  in the future 
we have no contractual commitment that will ensure these sales will continue in the future 
a failure of the water wells or distribution networks that we own or control could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 
we distribute water through a network of pipelines and store water in storage tanks 
a failure of these pipelines or tanks could result in injuries and damage to property for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of these pipelines or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs 
such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by our contracts  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and reputation 
any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and may decline in the future 
our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past and may experience significant fluctuations in the future depending upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
factors that could affect our stock price and trading volume include  among others  the perceived prospects of our business  differences between anticipated and actual operating results  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  the commencement and or results of litigation and other legal proceedings  and future sales of our common stock by significant shareholders  officers and directors 
in addition  stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume volatility from time to time  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our performance

item legal proceedings as discussed in a form k filed on december   on that date we and the district filed a lawsuit against the state of colorado by and through the land board 
the complaint was filed with the district court  city and county of denver  state of colorado 
we and the district are claiming that the land board breached  and will breach  agreements entered into by the land board with us and the district in connection with a settlement agreement 
those agreements include i the amended and restated water lease  dated as of april   between the land board and the district the lease and ii the service agreement of the same date between us and the district 
the land board asserted certain counterclaims in the lawsuit that relate to operational disputes under the lease 
on june   we  the district and the land board entered into an arbitration agreement pursuant to which the parties have agreed to submit three counterclaims under the lease to binding arbitration i whether revenues from wastewater services are subject to royalties under the lease and the appropriate payment for a right of way for a wastewater reclamation facility  ii whether export water royalties are owed on a net or gross proceeds basis  and iii if  and or how water from the four aquifers under the lowry range should be blended for sale  as well as any related claims of us and the district for offset  credit or overpayment of previous royalties paid and defenses to the three claims 
the counterclaims have been dismissed from the lawsuit without prejudice 
an arbitrator has not yet been selected  so the timing of resolution of these claims is unknown 
we and the district believe that we have been conducting our operations in accordance with the lease and are prepared to defend our decisions in the arbitration 
as disclosed in two form k s  one filed on february  and one filed on february   hp a m initiated a lawsuit against us in district court  city and county of denver  state of colorado on february  alleging breaches of representations made in connection with the arkansas river agreement 
hp a m claims relate to the issues currently being litigated between us and the land board regarding our exclusive right to provide water service to the land board s lowry range property 
because the claims alleged by hp a m relate to the issues being litigated in our lawsuit against the land board  the hp a m suit has been stayed pending resolution of the land board suit 
we believe the allegations are without merit and intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously 
during the fiscal year ended august   foreclosure proceedings were commenced against of the properties we acquired from hp a m which are subject to promissory notes defaulted upon by hp a m and secured by deeds of trust on our land and water rights 
as of august   of our properties acquired from hp a m remain subject to foreclosure proceedings 
these properties represent over of our flcc shares and over of our farm land 
the proceedings were filed on various dates from january  through july   with the public trustees of bent  otero and prowers counties in colorado and involve claims against hp a m for its failure to pay the notes 
foreclosure proceedings in colorado take at least nine months to conclude 
foreclosure sales were conducted on three of our properties on august   and on a fourth property on september  pcy holdings  llc pcy holdings  our wholly owned subsidiary  was the successful bidder in the foreclosure sales 
due to statutory protections afforded us as the owner of the properties and our liquidity  we had anticipated concluding these foreclosure proceedings on terms which would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  on september   hp a m filed a complaint against pcy holdings and the public trustee for the county of bent  colorado 
the lawsuit was filed in the district court  county of bent  colorado 
hp a m is seeking i a declaratory judgment that it is entitled to redeem the four properties from the foreclosure sales by paying the amount of the outstanding debt  plus fees  which is the amount we bid in the sales  and ii preliminary and permanent injunctions against the public trustee preventing the public trustee from issuing confirmation deeds for the foreclosure sales to pcy holdings or anyone other than hp a m 
on november   the complaint was dismissed with prejudice  and judgment was entered in favor of the public trustee and pcy holdings 
the district court ruled that high plains complaint and motion are baseless  without statutory authority  and are an attempt to obstruct the proper function of the office of the public trustee of bent county  and pcy holdings relative to the foreclosures of the four subject farms 
further the district court ruled that high plains motion and its claims in its verified complaint are frivolous and groundless  and awards the public trustee of bent county and pcy holdings their attorneys fees and costs incurred in connection with this matter 
hp a m has days from the date of the judgment in which to file an appeal 
if hp a m appeals this judgment and wins on appeal  we could lose these four properties  subject to our remedies under the arkansas river agreement 
we intend to vigorously defend any appeal of this ruling 
the arkansas river agreement requires hp a m to acquire any properties subject to foreclosure on our behalf 
therefore  our remedies against hp a m for the note defaults include the right to damages for any loss of these four properties

our business pure cycle corporation we  us or our is an investor owned colorado corporation that i provides wholesale water and wastewater services to end use customers of governmental entities and to commercial and industrial customers and ii manages land and water assets for farming 
wholesale water and wastewater these services include water production  storage  treatment  bulk transmission to retail distribution systems  wastewater collection and treatment  irrigation water treatment and transmission  construction management  billing and collection and emergency response 
we are a vertically integrated wholesale water and wastewater provider  which means we own or control substantially all assets necessary to provide wholesale water and wastewater services to our customers 
this includes owning i water rights which we use to provide domestic  irrigation  and industrial water to our wholesale customers we own surface water  groundwater  reclaimed water rights and storage rights  ii infrastructure such as wells  diversion structures  pipelines  reservoirs and treatment facilities required to withdraw  treat  store and deliver water  iii infrastructure required to collect  treat  store and reuse wastewater  and iv infrastructure required to treat and deliver reclaimed water for irrigation use 
we currently provide wholesale water service predominately to two local governmental entity customers 
our largest customer is the rangeview metropolitan district the district  a quasi municipal political subdivision of the state of colorado  which is described further below 
we provide service to the district and its end use customers pursuant to the rangeview water agreements defined below between us and the district for the provision of wholesale water service to the district for use in the district s service area 
through our governmental entity wholesale customers  we serve single family equivalent sfe as defined below water connections and sfe wastewater connections located in southeastern metropolitan denver 
we plan to utilize our significant water assets along with our adjudicated reservoir sites to provide wholesale water and wastewater services to local governmental entities which in turn will provide residential commercial water and wastewater services to communities along the eastern slope of colorado in the area extending essentially from fort collins on the north to colorado springs on the south  which is generally referred to as the front range 
principally we target the i corridor  which is located east of downtown denver and south of the denver international airport 
this area is predominately undeveloped and is expected to experience substantial growth over the next years 
agricultural operations and leasing beginning august   we assumed management of our farm operations and all associated income and expenses 
beginning september   we began tracking and reporting our farm operations as a separate business segment to reflect management s analysis  investment decision  and operating performance for this business segment 
currently  approximately of our farm operations are managed through cash lease arrangements with local area farmers whereby we charge a fixed fee  billed semi annually in march and november  to lease our land and the water for agricultural purposes to tenant farmers 
we have a small number of crop share leases  pursuant to which we and the tenant farmer jointly share in the gross revenues generated from the crops grown under a farmer  landlord participation 
the majority of crops grown on our farms are alfalfa  with a number of acres also planted in corn  sorghum  and wheat 
we will continue to review and evaluate ways to enhance the performance of our approximately  acres of farm land through relationships with area farmers 
we also own acres of land along the i corridor east of denver  colorado 
we are currently leasing this land to an area farmer until such time as the property can be developed 
these land interests are described in the arkansas river water and land and sky ranch sections of note water assets to the annual report 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the timing of revenue recognition  the impairment of water assets and other long lived assets  valuation of the tap participation fee  fair value estimates and share based compensation 
below is a summary of these critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenues consist mainly of tap fees  construction fees  monthly service fees  and beginning in fiscal  farm operations 
as further described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the accompanying financial statements  proceeds from tap sales and construction fees are deferred upon receipt and recognized in income based on whether we own or do not own the facilities constructed with the proceeds 
we recognize tap fees derived from agreements for which we construct infrastructure owned by others as revenue  along with the associated costs of construction  pursuant to the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires management to estimate the percent of work that is completed on a particular project  which could change materially throughout the duration of the construction period and result in significant fluctuations in revenue recognized during the reporting periods throughout the construction process 
we did not recognize any revenues pursuant to the percentage of completion method during the fiscal years ended august   or tap and construction fees derived from agreements for which we own the infrastructure are recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated service life of the assets constructed with said fees 
although the cash will be received up front and most construction will be completed within one year of receipt of the proceeds  revenue recognition may occur over years or more 
management is required to estimate the service life  and currently the service life is based on the estimated useful accounting life of the assets constructed with the tap fees 
the useful accounting life of the asset is based on management s estimation of an accounting based useful life and may not have any correlation to the actual life of the asset or the actual service life of the tap 
this is deemed a reasonable recognition life of the revenues because the depreciation of the assets constructed generating those revenues will therefore be matched with the revenues 
monthly water usage fees and monthly wastewater service fees are recognized in income each month as earned 
pursuant to the o g lease  we received up front payments which are recognized as other income on a straight line basis over three years the initial term of the o g lease 
historically  we have leased our arkansas river land and water to tenant farmers under a cash lease model 
pursuant to the property management agreement  hp a m was to receive the income from the farm leases until as a result of hp a m s default of certain obligations  we terminated the property management agreement 
effective as of august  we are managing the farm operations and we are entitled to receive all income from such operations 
currently we lease our farms to local area farmers on both cash and crop share lease basis 
our cash lease farmers are charged a fixed fee  billed semi annually in march and november 
during the november billing cycle our cash lease billings include either a discount or a premium adjustment based on actual water deliveries by the flcc 
our crop share lease fees are based on actual crop yields and are received upon the sale of the crops 
all fees are estimated and recognized ratably on a monthly basis 
impairment of water assets and other long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever management believes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows we expect to be generated by the eventual use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired and therefore the costs of the assets deemed to be unrecoverable  the impairment to be recognized would be the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
our water assets will be utilized in the provision of water services which inevitably will encompass many housing and economic cycles 
our service capacities are quantitatively estimated based on an average single family home utilizing 
acre feet of water per year 
our water supplies are legally decreed to us through the water court 
the water court decree allocates a specific amount of water subject to continued beneficial use which historically has not changed 
thus  individual housing and economic cycles typically do not have an impact on the number of connections we can serve with our supplies or the amount of water legally decreed to us relating to these supplies 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
our front range and arkansas river water rights we determine the undiscounted cash flows for our denver based assets and the arkansas river assets by estimating tap sales to potential new developments in our service area and along the front range  using estimated future tap fees less estimated costs to provide water services  over an estimated development period 
actual new home development in our service area and the front range  actual future tap fees  and actual future operating costs  inevitably will vary significantly from our estimates  which could have a material impact on our financial statements as well as our results of operations 
we performed an impairment analysis as of august   which we reviewed as of august   and determined there were no material changes and that our denver based assets and our arkansas river assets are not impaired and their costs are deemed recoverable 
our impairment analysis is based on development occurring within areas in which we have service agreements eg sky ranch and the lowry range as well as in surrounding areas  including the front range and the i corridor 
we estimate that we have the ability to provide water service to  sfe s using our combined rangeview water supply  sky ranch water and arkansas river water assets which have a carrying value of million as of august  based on the carrying value of our water rights  the long term and uncertain nature of any development plans  current tap fees of  and estimated gross margins  we estimate that we would need to add  new water connections requiring of our portfolio to generate net revenues sufficient to recover the costs of our rangeview water supply and arkansas river water assets 
if tap fees increase  we would need to add  new water taps requiring of our portfolio to recover the costs of our rangeview water supply and arkansas river water assets 
if tap fees decrease  we would need to add  new water taps requiring of our portfolio to recover the costs of our rangeview water supply and arkansas river water assets 
although changes in the housing market throughout the front range have delayed our estimated tap sale projections  these changes do not alter our water ownership  nor our service obligations to existing properties or the number of sfe s we can service 
we have contracts to sell farms totaling  acres along with  flcc shares associated with the land 
our paradise water supply every six years the paradise water supply is subject to a finding of reasonable diligence review by the water court and the state engineer 
for a favorable finding we must demonstrate that we are diligently pursuing the development of the water rights 
if we do not receive a favorable finding of reasonable diligence  our right to the paradise water supply would be lost and we would be required to impair the paradise water supply asset 
the most recent diligence review was started in our fiscal and was completed in  but not without objectors and not without us having to agree to certain stipulations to remove the objections 
in order to continue to maintain the paradise water right  by we must i select an alternative reservoir site  ii file an application in water court to change the place of storage  iii identify specific end users and place s of use of the water  and iv identify specific source s of the water rights for use 
we do not intend to spend the resources needed to find an alternative reservoir site without a specific use for the water 
we have been unable to find potential customers for this water and cannot be certain a customer will commit to use the water within the next two years 
since we do not have a customer that will commit to use the water and we will not commit the resources necessary to move the reservoir site without a customer  we expect to lose the conditional water rights 
accordingly  we have deemed the paradise water supply to be fully impaired and an impairment of million was recorded in the accompanying fiscal financial statements 
we are currently working on options to dispose of our paradise water supply asset 
tap participation fee the million tap participation fee liability at august   represents the estimated discounted fair value of the company s obligation to pay hp a m of the company s gross proceeds  or the equivalent thereof  from the future sale of  water taps by the company 
as partial consideration for the purchase of our farms and related water  we agreed to pay hp a m of the tap fees we receive from the next  water taps we sell from and after the date of the arkansas river agreement 
the tpf is payable only when we sell water taps and receive funds from such water tap sales from any of our properties as well as any sale of water rights we had purchased from hp a m 
payment of the tpf may be accelerated in the event of a merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all assets  or similar transactions and in the event of bankruptcy and insolvency events 
the tpf liability is valued by estimating new home development in our service area over an estimated development period 
this was done by utilizing third party historical and projected housing and population growth data for the denver metropolitan area applied to an estimated development pattern supported by historical development patterns of certain master planned communities in the denver metropolitan area 
this development pattern was then applied to projected future water tap fees determined by using historical water tap fee trends 
actual new home development in our service area and actual future tap fees inevitably will vary significantly from our estimates  which could have a material impact on our financial statements as well as our results of operations 
the difference between the net present value and the estimated realizable value will be imputed as interest expense using the effective interest method over the estimated development period utilized in the valuation of the tpf 
see further discussion in the obligations payable by hp a m  now in default section below 
an important component in our estimate of the value of the tpf is that water tap fees will continue to increase in the coming years 
tap fees are market based and increases in tap fees reflect  among other things  the increasing costs to acquire and develop new water supplies 
tap fees thus are partially indicative of the increasing value of our water assets 
we continue to assess the value of the tpf liability and update our valuation analysis whenever events or circumstances indicate the assumptions used to estimate the value of the liability have changed materially 
we updated the estimated discounted cash flow analysis as of august   as described in more detail below 
pursuant to the arkansas river agreement  effective as of september   hp a m elected to increase the tpf percentage from to and take a corresponding reduction in the number of taps subject to the tpf 
in addition  the initial term of the property management agreement with hp a m expired on august  during the extended term of the property management agreement  we were permitted to allocate of the net revenues defined as all lease and related income received from the farms less employee expenses  direct expenses for managing the leases and a reasonable overhead allocation paid to hp a m against the tpf 
as a result of hp a m s default  on august  we terminated the property management agreement and stopped allocating of the net revenues to the tpf 
during the fiscal year  we allocated  to the tpf liability and to additional paid in capital due to hp a m being deemed a related party as of fiscal year end 
this is the equivalent of water taps 
during the fiscal year we foreclosed on three farms and one flcc certificate representing water rights only 
additionally we cured one farm in foreclosure 
as a result of these foreclosures  in accordance with our remedies pursuant to our agreement with hp a m  we exercised our right to reduce the tpf 
we reduced the number of taps subject to the tpf by  taps  and the discounted present value of the tpf by a total of approximately million 
as a result of the events described above  we revalued the tpf liability as of august  the updated valuation and the events described above resulted in the following our obligation to pay hp a m of the gross proceeds  or the equivalent thereof  from the sale of the next  water taps as of september   became an obligation to pay of the gross proceeds  or the equivalent thereof  from the sale of the next  water taps 
the total undiscounted estimated payments to hp a m for the tpf decreased million from the previous valuation completed in fiscal the total estimated payments were then discounted to the current valuation date and the difference between the amount reflected on the company s balance sheet and the total estimated payments is imputed as interest expense over the estimated development life using the effective interest method 
the imputed effective interest rate remained and the amount of interest imputed was million for fiscal as of august  there were  taps subject to the tpf and we revalued the tpf liability resulting in a remaining discounted present value liability of million 
million of interest has been imputed since the acquisition date recorded using the effective interest method 
subsequent to our fiscal year end an additional three farms and  flcc shares have been obtained through the foreclosure proceedings resulting in a further reduction of the number of taps subject to the tpf by  taps and a corresponding reduction to the tpf payable of million  leaving  taps subject to the tpf 
fair value estimates fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market 
we generally use a fair value hierarchy that has three levels of inputs  both observable and unobservable  with use of the lowest possible level of input to determine fair value 
see note fair value measurements to the accompanying financial statements 
as discussed below  we used other methodologies to determine the fair value of the related party receivable from hp a m  certain notes payable issued by us in exchange for hp a m notes  and the receivable for unpaid balances owed to hp a m for farm lease payments that are now payable to us 
obligations payable by hp a m  now in default approximately of the properties we acquired from hp a m were subject to outstanding promissory notes payable to third parties 
these promissory notes are secured by deeds of trust on our properties and water rights  as well as mineral interests  up to of which are owned by us and up to of which are currently owned by hp a m 
as of fiscal year end and since that date  hp a m has defaulted on all of the notes 
at the time of default  hp a m owed approximately million of principal and accrued interest secured by approximately  acres of farm land and  flcc shares representing water rights owned by us 
on july   we formally notified hp a m that its failure to pay the promissory notes constituted an event of default under the seller pledge agreement and a default of a material covenant under the arkansas river agreement and that unless such defaults were cured within thirty days  the property management agreement would be terminated and we would proceed to exercise certain rights and remedies under the arkansas river agreement  the seller pledge agreement  and the property management agreement to protect our assets 
our remedies at law and under the arkansas river agreement and related agreements include  but are not limited to  the right to i terminate the property management agreement  ii foreclose on the pledged shares  iii reduce the tap participation fee  and iv recover damages caused by the defaults  including certain costs and attorneys fees 
pursuant to these remedies we have taken the following actions i on august   we formally terminated the property management agreement 
see further discussion in farm accounts receivable and future farm income below 
ii during september we sold the pledged shares in accordance with the seller pledge agreement yielding approximately million to us 
iii as described in note long term debt and operating lease  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  to protect our land and water interests  upon a default by hp a m  at our sole discretion  we may take any measure we deem appropriate to remedy all of the defaults 
if we do not protect our interest relating to the defaults  we may lose the properties and water rights securing the defaulted notes 
as of august   we have acquired approximately million of the million of promissory notes that are payable by hp a m to third parties 
these promissory notes were acquired with cash payments of approximately million and the issuance of notes by us 
the majority of the notes we issued have a five year term  bear interest at an annual rate of and require semi annual payments with a straight line amortization schedule 
the carrying value of the notes payable approximate the fair value as the rates are comparable to market rates 
we did not assume any of these promissory notes and are not legally responsible for making any of the required payments under these notes 
this responsibility remains solely with hp a m 
during the fiscal year four farms and one flcc certificate representing water only went through foreclosure proceedings 
in accordance with our remedies pursuant to our agreement with hp a m  we exercised our right to reduce the tpf as a result of these foreclosures 
we reduced the number of taps by  or a total of approximately million 
subsequent to our fiscal year end an additional three farms and  flcc shares have been through the foreclosure proceedings resulting in a further reduction of  taps 
iv we have the right to collect from hp a m any amounts we spend to protect our interest against the defaulted notes  including the new notes we issue to the holders in exchange for the hp a m notes 
among other remedies we have the right to collect from hp a m all costs and expenses  including reasonable attorneys fees  we incur to protect our interest against the defaults and in protecting our rights and title to the farm property and water rights securing the notes 
the following table details the balance in hp default receivable as of august  and august  august  august  hp a m receivable mortgage default attorneys fees  filing fees  other costs pledged share sale hp a m receivable includes default interest paid at the time we acquired the notes

farm accounts receivable and farm operations the property management agreement was terminated prior to the end of fiscal and all future farm income will be paid directly to us instead of hp a m 
most of the farm leases are cash only leases and a few are crop share leases 
a crop share lease entitles us to a share of the sales from the crop sales of the farmer 
most of the farm leases expire on december   while the remaining leases have a variety of expiration dates 
the farm cash only lease payments are generally billed twice a year in march and november 
the unpaid balances from the march billing performed by hp a m were recorded on our books as accounts receivable less an allowance for uncollectible accounts of  we may terminate the leases by written notice on or before july th of the year prior to the termination 
as of july   none of the leases were terminated 
under the cash only lease agreements  the annual lease payment can be reduced if the number of annual runs of irrigation water delivered to the farm as reported by the fort lyon canal company fall below runs 
if the annual runs of irrigation are less than  the annual lease rate will be reduced by per acre per run less than the runs with a maximum annual discount of per acre 
during calendar year  the lessee farmers only received runs 
accordingly  the maximum discount of per acre will be applied to the second billing in november this discount which will be deducted with the november billing is reflected in the schedule below 
all future expected cash billings are reflected at their full value 
the crop share agreements are generally year agreements and the payment cannot be calculated until after the farmers sell their crops 
accordingly any future payments from crop share leases are not included in the future farm lease billings schedule below 
the future scheduled billing for the farm income is presented in table f below table f contractual farm lease income receivable payments due to pure cycle by period total less than year years contractual lease income receivable farm leases receivable total expenses associated with the farm operations are expected to include management salaries  maintenance  property taxes and flcc assessments 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards made to key employees and directors on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
we then expense the fair value over the vesting period of the grant using a straight line expense model 
the fair value of share based payments requires management to estimate calculate various inputs such as the volatility of the underlying stock  the expected dividend rate  the estimated forfeiture rate and an estimated life of each option 
we do not expect any forfeiture of option grants  therefore the compensation expense has not been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
these assumptions are based on historical trends and estimated future actions of option holders and may not be indicative of actual events which may have a material impact on our financial statements 
for further details on share based compensation expense  see note shareholders equity to the accompanying financial statements
