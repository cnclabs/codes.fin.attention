item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
overview we are a company with limited liability incorporated in under the laws of the cayman islands 
headquartered in beijing  we provide products and services to oil and gas companies and their affiliates through our domestic companies 
as the company contractually controlling the domestic companies  we are the center of strategic management  financial control and human resources allocation 
our business is mainly focused on the upstream sectors of the oil and gas industry 
we derive our revenues from the sales and provision of oilfield dedicated products and accessories  stimulation technology and services 
our products and services involve most of the key procedures of the extraction and production of oil and gas  and include automation systems  equipment  tools and on site technical services 
our vies provide the oil and gas industry with equipment  production technologies  automation and services to enhance our customers efficiency 
nanjing recon nanjing recon is a high tech company that specializes in automation services for oilfield companies 
it mainly focuses on providing automation solutions to the oil exploration industry  including monitoring wells  automatic metering to the joint station production  process monitor  and a variety of oilfield equipment and control systems 
bhd bhd is a high tech company that specializes in transportation equipment and stimulation productions and services 
possessing proprietary patents and substantial industry experience  bhd has built up stable and strong working relationships with the major oilfields in china 
business outlook the oilfield engineering and technical service industry is generally divided into five sections exploration  drilling and completion  testing and logging  production and oilfield construction 
our businesses have mainly focused on production processes 
as of this year  we are also expanding our business to well completion and horizontal well down hole service process 
we still believe that many existing oil wells and oilfields are in need of renewal and improvement on their current equipment to maintain production 
we also believe that as many new wells are developed  our gathering and transferring equipment will be in great need 
accordingly  in the next year  we will focus on the following areas 
measuring equipment and service 
digital oil field and the management of oil companies are highly regarded 
we believe our oilfield supervisory control and data acquisition scada and related technical support services will address the needs of the oil well automation system market  for which we forecast strong needs in the short term 
through early cooperation with cnpc on turkmenistan  we have developed our experience in this market 
although bidding has not yet commenced  we will continue pursuing overseas business projects in the coming second phase construction 
gathering and transferring equipment 
with more new wells developed  our management anticipates that demand for our furnaces and burners will grow more compared to last year  especially in the jilin oilfield and xinjiang oilfield 
fracturing business 
we believe we cooperated well with zhongyuan oilfield in and expect to continue growing revenue from fracturing and related stimulation services in the coming year 
new business 
design and development of down hole tools has always been an important technique for oilfield companies 
recently  this market has developed very rapidly 
after a year test project for our client  we have developed experience with this technology and our products and servers have been accepted by our client 
we received modest revenue this year and expect more revenue from this business in the coming year 
recent industry developments despite uncertainty in the energy industry related to such matters as fluctuating prices and future opportunities for oil companies  our management believes there are still many factors to support our long term development the opening of the chinese oil industry to participation by non state owned service providers and vendors played an increasingly important role in the high end oilfield service segment to allow competition based on efficiency and price 
as oil and gas fields are depleted  it becomes more challenging to find and convert reserves into usable energy sources 
as the industry has permitted competition by private companies and oil companies have formed separate service companies  high tech service has gradually opened up to private companies 
speeding up the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources such as shale gas and coal bed methane will bring more requirements of related technic and service 
china is rich in unconventional hydrocarbon resources  but new exploration and development technology breakthroughs are urgently needed  and overseas assets of chinese oilfield companies increased gradually  and they will provide more opportunity for domestic service companies to participate in foreign projects 
management is focused on these factors and will seek to extend our business on the industrial chain  like providing more integrated services and incremental measures and growing our business from a predominantly up ground business to include some down hole services as well 
growth strategy as a smaller local company  it is our basic strategy to focus on developing our onshore oilfield business  ie the upstream of the industry 
due to the remote location and difficult environment of china s oil and gas fields  foreign competitors rarely enter those fields 
large domestic oil companies prefer to focus on their exploration and development businesses to earn higher margins and keep their competitive advantage 
with regard to private oilfield service companies  specialize in the manufacture of drilling and production equipment 
thus  the market for technical support and project service is still in its early stage 
our management focuses on providing high quality products and service at oilfields where we have a geographical advantage 
such strategy allows us to avoid conflicts of interest with bigger suppliers of drilling equipment and keep our leading position within the market segment 
our mission is to increase the automation and safety levels of industrial petroleum production in china  and improve its efficiency and effectiveness through advanced technologies 
at the same time  we are always looking to improve our business and to increase our earning capability 
on june   the company acquired of a us oil and natural gas company outstanding shares for approximately million 
this strategic investment marks an important step in expanding our business in the us market 
factors affecting our results of operations our operating results in any period are subject to the general conditions typically affecting the chinese oilfield service industry including the amount of spending by our customers  primarily those in the oil and gas industry  growing demand from large corporations for improved management and software designed to enhance corporate performance  the procurement processes of our customers  especially those in the oil and gas industry  competition and related pricing pressure from other oilfield service solution providers  especially those targeting the oil and gas industry in china  the ongoing development of the oilfield service market in china  and inflation and other factors 
unfavorable changes in any of these general conditions could negatively affect the number and size of the projects we undertake  the number of products we sell  the amount of services we provide  the price of our products and services or otherwise affect our results of operations 
our operating results in any period are more directly affected by company specific factors including our continued ability to lead and to control all affiliated entities  our revenue growth  the proportion of our business dedicated to large companies  our ability to successfully develop  introduce and market new solutions and services  our ability to increase our revenues from customers both old and new in the oil and gas industry in china  our ability to effectively manage our operating costs and expenses  and our ability to effectively implement any targeted acquisitions and or strategic alliances so as to provide efficient access to the markets in the oil and gas industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates and assumptions we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  which require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information  our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made  and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant accounting estimates 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this quarterly report 
significant accounting estimates reflected in our company s consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and useful lives of property and equipment 
consolidation of vies we recognize an entity as a vie if it either i has insufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or ii has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
we consolidate a vie as its primary beneficiary when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
we will continue to make ongoing assessment whether our vies still continue to be vies and whether we continue to be the primary beneficiary 
assets recognized as a result of consolidating vies do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets 
conversely  liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these vies do not represent additional claims on our general assets  rather  they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated vies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery does not occur until products have been shipped or services have been provided to the client and the client has signed a completion and acceptance report  risk of loss has transferred to the client  client acceptance provisions have lapsed  or the company has objective evidence that the criteria specified in client acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
the sales price is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all contingencies related to the sale have been resolved 
hardware revenue from hardware sales is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when there are no unfulfilled company obligations that affect the customer s final acceptance of the arrangement 
software the company sells self developed software 
for software sales  the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification  topic  software revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
revenue from software is recognized according to project contracts 
contract costs are accumulated during the periods of installation and testing or commissioning 
usually this is short term 
revenue is not recognized until completion of the contracts and receipt of acceptance statements 
services the company provides services to improve software functions and system requirements on separated fixed price contracts 
revenue is recognized when services are completed and acceptance is determined by a completion report signed by the customer 
deferred income represents unearned amounts billed to customers related to sales contracts 
cost of revenues when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met  costs incurred are recognized as cost of revenue 
cost of revenues includes wages  materials  handling charges  the cost of purchased equipment and pipes  and other expenses associated with manufactured products and services provided to customers 
we expect cost of revenues to grow as our revenues grow 
it is possible that we could incur development costs with little revenue recognition  but based upon our past history  we expect our revenues to grow 
fair values of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for trade accounts receivable  other receivables  advances to suppliers  trade accounts payable  accrued liabilities  advances from customers and notes payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short term maturity of these financial instruments 
long term other receivables approximate fair value because the interest rate approximates the market rate 
long term investment is carried at less than fair value  with fair value determined using level inputs 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables and other receivable accounts are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method  less a provision made for impairment of these receivables 
provisions are applied to trade and other receivables where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the balance may not be collectible 
the identification of doubtful accounts requires the use of judgment and estimates of management 
our management must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
long term investment long term investment in equity over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control  and that  in general  are percent owned are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income loss of the investee 
these investments are evaluated for impairment  in which an impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in the value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in judging other than temporary  the company would consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investment  the near term and longer term operating and financial prospects of the investee  and the company longer term intent of retaining the investment in the investee 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable 
when such an event occurs  we project undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition over the remaining life of the asset 
if projections indicate that the carrying value of the long lived asset will not be recovered  we reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset by the estimated excess of the carrying value over the projected discounted cash flows 
in the past  we have not had to make significant adjustments to the carrying values of our long lived assets  and we do not anticipate a need to do so in the future 
however  circumstances could cause us to have to reduce the value of our capitalized software more rapidly than we have in the past if our revenues were to significantly decline 
estimated cash flows from the use of the long lived assets are highly uncertain and therefore the estimation of the need to impair these assets is reasonably likely to change in the future 
should the economy or the acceptance of our software change in the future  it is likely that our estimate of the future cash flows from the use of these assets will change by a material amount 
new accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements in february the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu no 
comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  requiring new disclosures for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  including changes in aoci balances by component and significant items reclassified out of aoci

our historical reporting results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
revenue for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change hardware non related parties hardware related parties service software related parties software total revenues our total revenues for the year ended june  were approximately million million  an increase of approximately million or from million for the year ended june  this was mainly caused by hardware business 
during the year ended june   hardware revenues decreased mainly because we recorded significant revenue from our turkmenistan project in  while there is no such revenue in hardware related parties 
sales of hardware to related parties decreased because one entity ceased to be a related party in in  we generated revenues from two related parties 
in  we sold to the same two parties  but one was no longer a related party  and as a result  revenues from that party were included in hardware non related parties revenue for the years ended june  and  and some revenue was allocated to software revenue related parties 
service business 
most of our increased revenue during the year ended june  was from our fracturing service business 
during the year ended june   recon bhd signed several fracturing service contracts with an aggregate contract value of rmb million with sinopec zhongyuan oilfield 
as of june   we have completed all those contracts and recognized the corresponding revenues from the contracts 
we continue to perform fracturing work beyond those contracts 
software business 
the software sales increased approximately million million 
we record revenue as software sales when the customer signs a separate software contract with us  or the customer accepts vat invoices for software 
the amount of our revenues categorized as software sales may fluctuate because certain software may be sold with hardware at times as a whole product and not separately priced 
software business related parties 
this revenue was from ji dong oilfield  which is considered related party revenue because we have done business with this oilfield through beijing yabei nuoda  a company of which our chief executive officer is legal representative 
as mentioned above  we recorded revenue as software sales only when it satisfies specific criteria 
revenue from software related parties should be considered together with hardware sales from related parties 
this increase only reflected separately recorded software revenue increase  while our automation business with ji dong oilfield developed well 
cost and margin for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change total revenues cost of revenues gross profit margin cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues includes raw materials and costs related to design  implementation  delivery and maintenance of products and services 
all materials and components we need can be purchased or manufactured under contracts 
usually the prices of electronic components do not fluctuate dramatically due to market competition and will not significantly affect our cost of revenues 
however  specialized equipment and incentive chemical products may be directly influenced by the price fluctuation of metal and oil 
additionally  the prices of some imported accessories mandated by our clients can also impact our cost 
our cost of revenues increased from approximately million in the year ended june  to approximately million million for the year ended june   an increase of approximately million  or 
as a percentage of revenues  our cost of revenues decreased from in to in gross profit 
our gross profit increased to approximately million million for the year ended june  from approximately million for the year ended june  our gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended june  from for the same period in in more detail for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change total revenues hardware and software non related parties cost of revenues hardware and software non related parties gross profit margin cost of revenue from hardware and software related parties decreased  causing gross profit from non related parties increased  was mainly because revenue from software business  which usually enjoying a higher margin  occupied larger proportion of our revenue 
for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change total revenues hardware and software related parties cost of revenues hardware and software related parties gross profit margin cost of revenue from hardware and software related parties increased as revenue increased 
while gross margin decreased was mainly because software revenue accounted for larger proportion last year 
for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change total revenues service cost of revenues service gross profit margin cost of revenue and gross margin from service business both increased as fracturing business increased dramatically 
while as more popularization and completion in this aspect  general margin decreased 
so did our business 
so far  our management are trying to ease this negative situation through import substitution and training our own service team to save cost  thus to maintain a reasonable margin level 
expenses for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change selling and distribution expenses of revenue general and administrative expenses of revenue research and development expenses of revenue operating expenses selling and distribution expenses 
selling and distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenditures of our sales and marketing organization  sales commissions  costs of our marketing programs including advertising and trade shows  and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
selling and distribution expenses increased by  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million million for the same period of this increase was primarily due to the increased expenses related to shipping charges  traveling expenses and maintenance expenses 
selling and distribution expenses were of total revenues in the year ended june  and of total revenues in the same period of the percentage increase was a result of the above mentioned expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs in human resources  facilities costs  depreciation expenses  professional advisor fees  audit fees  option expenses and other expenses incurred in connection with general operations 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or approximately million million  from approximately million in the year ended june  to approximately million million in the same period of general and administrative expenses were of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly caused by lower allowance for doubtful accounts  audit fees  consulting and legal fees  offset by increased in salaries and entertainment expenses 
research and development r d expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenditures of our research and development projects 
research and development expenses increased by  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million million for the same period of this increase was primarily due to the increase in r d expenditure on our furnaces and fracturing services required to update our products and services 
net income for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change loss from operations interest and other income loss income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss less net income attributable to non controlling interest net income loss attributable to ordinary shareholders loss from operations 
loss from operations was approximately million million for the year ended june   compared to a loss of approximately million for the same period of this decrease in loss from operations is attributed primarily to the increased revenue and decrease in general and administrative expenses 
interest and other income loss 
interest and other income was approximately million million for the year ended june   compared to interest and other loss of million for the same period of the approximately million million increase in interest and other income was primarily due to increases in subsidy income  interest income  gain from foreign currency transactions and other income  offset by increase in interest expenses 
provision benefit for income tax 
provision for income tax is based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to us gaap 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is not likely that the asset will be realized 
we have not been subject to any income taxes in the united states or the cayman islands 
enterprises doing business in the prc are generally subject to federal state enterprise income tax at a rate of  however  nanjing recon and bhd were granted the certification of high technology enterprise and are taxed at a rate of for taxable income generated 
benefit for income tax for the year ended june  was  while the provision for income tax for the year ended june  was  
income taxes were higher in the period notwithstanding net losses because the vies had higher pre consolidation taxable income  which could not be offset by losses of the consolidated entity 
net income loss attributable to ordinary shareholders 
as a result of the factors described above  net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was   for the year ended june   an improvement of approximately million million from net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of approximately million for same period of adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before income tax expense  interest expense  non cash stock compensation expense  and depreciation and amortization expense 
we believe it is useful to an equity investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is widely used by investors in our industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense  depreciation and amortization  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods  the book value of assets  the capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired  and it helps investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results 
for the years ended june  increase percentage rmb rmb decrease change usd reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss net income loss provision benefit for income taxes interest expense and foreign currency adjustment stock compensation expense depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda improved by approximately million million to approximately million million for the year ended june  compared to loss of approximately million for the same period in as a result of increased revenues and lower operating expenses 
compared to net income attributable to ordinary shareholders  we believe ebitda more accurately reflects our operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash on hand  demand deposits and highly liquid short term debt investments with stated maturities of no more than six months 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of approximately million million 
indebtedness 
as of june   we had approximately million of short term borrowings from third parties  approximately million million of short term borrowings from related parties  and million million in commercial loans from two local banks 
other than these amounts  we did not have any finance leases or purchase commitments  guarantees or other material contingent liabilities 
holding company structure 
we are a holding company with no operations of our own 
all of our operations are conducted through our domestic companies 
as a result  our ability to pay dividends and to finance any debt that we may incur is dependent upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from the domestic companies 
in addition  chinese legal restrictions permit payment of dividends to us by our domestic companies only out of their accumulated net profit  if any  determined in accordance with chinese accounting standards and regulations 
under chinese law  our domestic companies are required to set aside a portion at least of their after tax net income after discharging all cumulated loss  if any  each year for compulsory statutory reserve until the amount of the reserve reaches of our domestic companies registered capital 
these funds may be distributed to shareholders at the time of each domestic company s wind up 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties 
in addition  we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our own shares and classified as shareholders equity  or that are not reflected in our financial statements 
furthermore  we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity 
moreover  we do not have any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
capital resources 
to date we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations  bank loans and short term borrowings 
as of june   we had total assets of approximately million million  which includes cash amounting to approximately million million  net accounts receivable from third parties amounting to approximately million million  and net accounts receivable from related parties amounting to approximately million million 
working capital amounted to approximately million million  and shareholders equity amounted to approximately million million 
our management believes  as most of our accounting receivables can be collected in one year  our working capital will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirement of current operations for the next months 
cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million million for the year ended june  this was an increase of approximately million million compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately million for year ended june  this increase was mainly due to the fact that we earned net profit in fiscal while we experienced net losses in fiscal in more detail collection of trade accounts receivable from third parties and related parties increased approximately million million  inventory decreased approximately million million due to increasing sales activities  other accounts payable increased approximately million million mainly due to an increase in other accounts payable to one related party  trade accounts payable  including payables to related parties  decreased approximately million million because of some purchases due on suppliers demand  which were mainly to our supplier of furnaces  and payment of vat  which caused a decrease of approximately million million in taxes payable  which was offset by tax recoverable 
cash from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million million for the year ended june   an increase of million million from million for the same period of the increase in net cash used in investing activities was mainly due to an approximately million increase in long term investment for a equity investment in a us oil and natural gas company offset by million increase in proceeds from disposal of fixed assets and a decrease of approximately  in purchase of property and equipment 
cash from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to approximately million million for the year ended june   compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately million for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we repaid million million in commercial bank loans and received million million in loans from two banks  which were guaranteed by one of our shareholders  mr 
chen guangqiang  who is also an officer and director of our company 
working capital 
total working capital as of june  amounted to approximately million million  compared to approximately million as of june  total current assets as of june  amounted to approximately million million  a decrease of approximately million million compared to approximately million at june  the decrease in total current assets at june  compared to june  was mainly due to decrease of trade accounts receivable and inventory 
current liabilities amounted to approximately million million at june   in comparison to approximately million at june   a decrease of approximately million million 
this reduction of liabilities was attributable mainly to payment of trade accounts payable and taxes and repayment of short term bank loans and short term borrowings of non related parties
