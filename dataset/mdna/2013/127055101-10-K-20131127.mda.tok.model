item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if i the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and ii different estimates and assumptions were used  the results could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and application of our policies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below 
revenue recognition and accounts and notes receivable we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment 
if we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment or if title has not transferred because of sales terms  the revenue is considered unearned and is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenue when billed to customers or included in the sales price 
the following table shows the relative size of the revenue recognized in each of the company s reportable segments years ended september reinforcement materials performance materials advanced technologies purification solutions n a fiscal consists of two months of revenues for purification solutions  which we acquired on july  we derive the substantial majority of revenues from the sale of products in reinforcement materials and performance materials 
revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
we offer certain customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives 
the discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations 
we periodically review the assumptions underlying estimates of discounts and volume rebates and adjust revenues accordingly 
revenue in advanced technologies  excluding the specialty fluids business  is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
depending on the nature of the contract with the customer  a portion of the revenue may be recognized using proportional performance 
we have technology and licensing agreements with one customer that are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreements limited by the cumulative amounts that become due  some of which are through we recorded million of royalty and technology payments in fiscal year from these agreements 

table of contents a significant portion of the revenue in the specialty fluids business  included in advanced technologies  arises from the rental of cesium formate 
this revenue is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms 
customers are also billed and revenue is recognized  typically at the end of the job  for cesium formate product that is not returned 
we also generate revenues from cesium formate sold outside of a rental process and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the fluid 
revenue in purification solutions is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
for major activated carbon injection systems projects  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable and other economic information on both a historical and prospective basis 
customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
the change from fiscal to was million due to an increase in specific customer reserves 
the change from fiscal to was immaterial 
there is no off balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances 
inventory valuation the cost of all carbon black inventories in the us is determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
total us inventories utilizing this cost flow assumption were valued at million at september  and million at september  these inventories represent of total worldwide inventories at both september  and had we used the first in  first out fifo method instead of the lifo method for such inventories  the value of those inventories would have been million and million higher as of september  and  respectively 
the cost of specialty fluids inventories is determined using the average cost method 
the cost of other us and all us inventories is determined using the fifo method 
in periods of rapidly rising or declining raw material costs  the inventory method we employ can have a significant impact on our profitability 
at certain times  we may decrease inventory levels to the point where layers of inventory recorded under the lifo method that were purchased in preceding years are liquidated 
the inventory in these layers may be valued at an amount that is different than our current costs 
if there is a liquidation of an inventory layer  there may be an impact to our cost of sales and net income for that period 
if the liquidated inventory is at a cost lower than our current cost  there would be a reduction in our cost of sales and an increase to our net income during the period 
during fiscal and fiscal  inventory quantities carried on a lifo basis were reduced  leading to liquidations of lifo inventory quantities 
these lifo layer liquidations resulted in a decrease of cost of goods sold of million and an increase in consolidated net income of million per diluted common share in both fiscal and no such reductions occurred in fiscal we review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential loss of value periodically 
in this review  we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete  unmarketable or slow moving inventory 
we write down the value of our inventories by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
historically  such write downs have not been significant 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment  however  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings 
stock based compensation we have issued restricted stock  restricted stock units  and stock options under our equity compensation plans 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is the closing price of our stock on the day of the grant 
the fair value is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the vesting of certain restricted stock units is dependent on certain performance based criteria 
we evaluate the likelihood of achievement of such performance 
table of contents objectives each quarter and record stock based compensation based on this assessment 
there are no other significant estimates involved in recording compensation costs for restricted stock units with the exception of estimates we make around the probability of forfeitures 
changes in the forfeiture assumptions could impact our earnings but would not impact our cash flows 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options issued under our equity compensation plans 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we make a variety of assumptions and estimates  including discount rates  volatility measures  expected dividends and expected option lives 
changes to such assumptions and estimates can result in different fair values and could therefore impact our earnings 
such changes would not impact our cash flows 
goodwill and long lived assets we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting 
amounts paid for an acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is comprised of the purchase price of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually  or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
a reporting unit  for the purpose of the impairment test  is at or below the operating segment level  and constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management 
the separate businesses included within performance materials and advanced technologies are considered separate reporting units 
goodwill balances relative to these segments are recorded in the fumed metal oxides reporting unit within performance materials and the security materials reporting unit within advanced technologies 
for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value amount and as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
alternatively  we may elect to proceed directly to the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  an additional quantitative evaluation is performed under the two step impairment test 
if based on the quantitative evaluation the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we perform an analysis of the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined to be less than its carrying amount  an impairment is recognized for the difference 
the fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted estimated future cash flows 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value include management s estimates of future growth rates  operating cash flows  capital expenditures  and discount rates over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit level 
should the fair value of any of our reporting units decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment may be necessary 
the future growth in the purification solutions business  which had million of goodwill at september   is highly dependent on the growth in the mercury removal portion of this business 
this growth relies upon the adoption and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations  particularly those that would require us based coal fired electrical utilities to reduce the quantity of air pollutants they release  including mercury  to comply with the mercury and air toxics standards that become effective in april the annual review is performed as of may we use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
the determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment with regard to i assumptions used in the valuation model  and ii determination of the intangible assets useful lives 
we estimate the fair value of identifiable acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from these assets 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the fair value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
we review definite lived intangible assets for 
table of contents impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 
we evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
the annual review is performed as of may we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test or bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
the quantitative impairment test is based on discounted estimated future cash flows 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value include management s estimates of future growth rates and discount rates over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the unit of accounting level 
our intangible assets are primarily comprised of trademarks  customer relationships  patented and unpatented technology and other intellectual property 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
our long lived assets primarily include property  plant and equipment  long term investments  assets held for rent and sale 
the carrying values of long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the probability weighted undiscounted estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset 
our estimates reflect management s assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volumes  costs and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to fair value 
if the asset does not have a readily determinable market value  a discounted cash flow model may be used to determine the fair value of the asset 
the key inputs to the discounted cash flow would be the same as the undiscounted cash flow noted above  with the addition of the discount rate used 
in circumstances when an asset does not have separate identifiable cash flows  an impairment charge is recorded when we no longer intend to use the asset 
to test for impairment of assets we generally use a probability weighted estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to determine if the value of the asset is recoverable 
long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows are determinable 
financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  investments  notes receivable from the sale of a business  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  short term and long term debt  and derivative instruments 
the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate fair value with the exception of long term debt that has not been designated as part of a fair value hedge and notes receivable from the sale of business 
the non hedged long term debt and notes receivable from the sale of business are recorded at amortized cost 
the fair values of our financial instruments are based on quoted market prices  if such prices are available 
in situations where quoted market prices are not available  we rely on valuation models to derive fair value 
such valuation takes into account the ability of the financial counterparty to perform 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which exist as part of our on going business operations 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes  nor do we hold or issue any derivative contracts for trading purposes 
all derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
where we have a legal right to offset derivative settlements under a master netting agreement with a counterparty  derivatives with that counterparty are presented on a net basis 
the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in either earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income  depending on whether or not the instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if designated as part of a hedge transaction  the type of hedge transaction 
the gains or 
table of contents losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in earnings during the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs 
in accordance with our risk management strategy  we may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes 
although these derivatives are not designated as hedges  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
we record in earnings the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges 
cash movements associated with these instruments are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as cash flows from operating activities because the derivatives are designed to mitigate risk to our cash flow from operations 
the cash flows relating to the principal of these instruments was presented in the cash flows from financing activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value  including assets of our defined benefit pension plans  are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used for valuation 
assets that are actively traded on an exchange with a quoted price are classified as level assets and liabilities that are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or standard pricing models using observable inputs are classified as level as of september   we have no assets or liabilities carried at fair value that are valued using unobservable inputs and  therefore  no assets or liabilities that are classified as level the sensitivity of fair value estimates is immaterial relative to the assets and liabilities measured at fair value  as well as to our total equity  as of september  pensions and other postretirement benefits we maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees 
in addition  we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
the assumptions  which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans  are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans where applicable and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees 
the most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets 
assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied  they include estimated discount rates  rates of compensation increases for employees  mortality  employee turnover and other related demographic data 
projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
however  cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we incurred curtailment and settlement gains and losses in the us and foreign employee benefit plans as a result of the sale of the supermetals business and the freezing of two defined benefit plans in foreign affiliates 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we approved the freezing of our us pension plans as of january  this resulted in the remeasurement of the plan assets and liabilities 
the remeasurement decreased the net pension obligation of these plans  which is included within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  by million and increased accumulated other comprehensive income by million  net of tax 
the impact to the company s net periodic benefit cost was immaterial 
self insurance reserves we are partially self insured for certain third party liabilities globally  as well as workers compensation and employee medical benefits in the united states 
the third party and workers compensation liabilities are managed through a wholly owned insurance captive and the related liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
the employee medical obligations are managed by a third party provider and the related liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
to limit our potential liabilities for these risks in the us  however  we purchase insurance from third parties 
table of contents that provides individual and aggregate stop loss protection 
the aggregate self insured liability in fiscal for combined us third party liabilities and us workers compensation is million  and the retention for medical costs in the united states is at most  per person per annum 
we have accrued amounts equal to the actuarially determined future liabilities 
we determine the actuarial assumptions in collaboration with third party actuaries  based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such matters as legal actions  medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and impact our earnings and cash flows 
asset retirement obligations we account for asset retirement obligations by estimating incremental costs for special handling  removal and disposal costs of materials that may or will give rise to conditional asset retirement obligations aros and then discount the expected costs back to the current year using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
aro liabilities and costs are recognized when the timing and or settlement can be reasonably estimated 
if it is unclear when  or if  an aro will be triggered  we use probability weightings for possible timing scenarios to determine the amounts that should be recognized in our financial statements 
the estimation of aros is subject to a number of inherent uncertainties including a the timing of when any aro may be incurred  b the ability to accurately identify and reasonably estimate the costs of all materials that may require special handling or treatment  c the ability to assess the relative probability of different scenarios that could give rise to an aro  and d other factors outside our control  including changes in regulations  costs and interest rates 
aros have not been recognized for certain of our facilities because either the present value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminable facility life or we do not have a legal obligation associated with the retirement of those facilities 
in most circumstances where aros have been recorded  the anticipated cash outflows will likely take place far into the future 
accordingly  actual costs and the timing of such costs may vary significantly from our estimates  which may  in turn  impact our earnings 
in general  however  when such estimates change  the impact is spread over future years and thus the impact on any individual year is unlikely to be material 
litigation and contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury and environmental litigation 
after consultation with counsel  as appropriate  we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range 
our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information  including claims  settlement offers  demands by government agencies  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute  and our prior experience 
litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows 
the most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims 
the amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites  the nature of the remedies  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
a portion of the reserve for environmental matters is recognized on a discounted basis  which requires the use of an estimated discount rate and estimates of future cash flows associated with the liability 
these liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information  changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations  which could result in higher or lower costs 

table of contents our current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time and the amount accrued is recognized on a discounted basis 
developments that could affect our estimate include  but are not limited to  i significant changes in the number of future claims  ii changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending silica and non malignant asbestos claims  iii significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims  iv significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims  v changes in the nature of claims received  vi changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims  vii the financial viability of other parties which contribute to the settlement of respirator claims  viii a change in the availability of insurance coverage maintained by the entity from which we acquired the safety respirators products business or the indemnity provided by its former owner  ix changes in the allocation of costs among the various parties paying legal and settlement costs  and x a determination that the assumptions that were used to estimate our share of liability are no longer reasonable 
we cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims 
accordingly  the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount 
further  if the timing of our actual payments made for respirator claims differs significantly from our estimated payment schedule  and we determine that we can no longer reasonably predict the timing of such payments  we could then be required to record the reserve amount on an undiscounted basis on our consolidated balance sheets  causing an immediate impact to earnings 
income taxes our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change based on the political and economic climate in those countries 
we file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction s tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination uncertain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
we have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  and or our cash flow 
we record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities 
if this threshold is not met  no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized 
if the threshold is met  the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this analysis presumes the taxing authorities full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts  but does not consider the time value of money 
we also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carry forwards  foreign tax credits  and other income tax credits 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time 
we review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets 
an increase in a valuation allowance would 
table of contents result in additional income tax expense  while a release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our income tax expense 
highly inflationary environments we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment 
if and when a currency is determined to be highly inflationary cumulative inflation of approximately percent or more over a year period  the functional currency of the affected operation would be changed to our reporting currency  the us dollar 
due to cumulative inflation in venezuela over a three year period exceeding  the functional currency of our venezuelan operating entity is the us dollar 
restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance and other employee benefits to be granted to employees  which are based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  ii costs to vacate certain facilities and iii asset impairments 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of subsequent information that may come to our attention while executing the restructuring plans 
these changes in estimates would then be reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies we have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in note a of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item below 
certain of these policies include the use of estimates  but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure 
however  these policies are important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations definition of terms and non gaap financial measures when discussing our results of operations  we use several terms as described below 
the term product mix refers to the various types and grades  or mix  of products sold in a particular business or segment during the period  and the positive or negative impact of that mix on the revenue or profitability of the business or segment 
the term lifo includes two factors i the impact of current inventory costs being recognized immediately in cost of sales under a last in first out method  compared to the older costs that would have been included in cost of sales under a first in first out method cost of sales impact  and ii the impact of reductions in inventory quantities  causing historical inventory costs to flow through cogs liquidation impact 
the discussion under the heading provision for income taxes and reconciliation of effective tax rate to operating tax rate includes a discussion of our effective tax rate and our operating tax rate and includes a reconciliation of the two rates 
our operating tax rate is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to our effective tax rate  the most comparable gaap financial measure 
in calculating our operating tax rate  we exclude discrete tax items  which include i unusual or infrequent items such as a significant release of a valuation allowance  ii items related to uncertain tax positions such as the tax impact of audit settlements  interest on tax reserves  and the release of tax reserves from the expiration of statutes of limitations  and iii other discrete tax items  such as the tax 
table of contents impact of legislative changes and  on a quarterly basis  the timing of losses in certain jurisdictions and the cumulative rate adjustment  if applicable 
we also exclude the tax impact of certain items  as defined below in the discussion of total segment ebit  on both operating income and the tax provision 
our definition of the operating tax rate may not be comparable to the definition used by other companies 
management believes that the non gaap financial measure is useful supplemental information because it helps our investors compare our tax rate year to year on a consistent basis and understand what our tax rate on current operations would be without the impact of these items which we do not believe are reflective of the underlying business results 
total segment ebit is a non gaap performance measure  and should not be considered an alternative for income from continuing operations before taxes  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
in calculating total segment ebit  we make certain adjustments such as excluding certain items  meaning items that management does not consider representative of our fundamental segment results  as well as items that are not allocated to our business segments  such as interest expense and other corporate costs 
our chief operating decision maker uses segment ebit to evaluate the operating results of each segment and to allocate resources to the segments 
we believe total segment ebit provides useful supplemental information for our investors as it is an important indicator of the company s operational strength and performance 
investors should consider the limitations associated with this non gaap measure  including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another 
a reconciliation of total segment ebit to income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies is provided in note t of our consolidated financial statements 
cabot is organized into four reportable business segments reinforcement materials  performance materials  advanced technologies and purification solutions 
cabot is also organized for operational purposes into three geographic regions the americas  europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific 
discussions of all periods reflect these structures 
our analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
unless a calendar year is specified  all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended september on july   we purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of norit nv norit  the business of which we renamed and report as purification solutions 
our results for the twelve month period ended september  include two months of results for purification solutions 
drivers of demand and key factors affecting profitability drivers of demand and key factors affecting our profitability differ by segment 
in reinforcement materials  demand is influenced on a long term basis primarily by i the number of vehicle miles driven globally  ii the number of original equipment and replacement tires produced  and iii the number of automotive builds 
over the past several years  operating results have been driven by a number of factors  including i increases or decreases in sales volumes  ii changes in raw material costs and our ability to obtain sales price increases for our products commensurate with increases in raw material costs  iii changes in pricing and product mix  iv global and regional capacity utilization  v fixed cost savings achieved through restructuring and other cost saving activities  vi the growth of our volumes and market position in emerging economies  and vii capacity management and technology investments  including the impact of energy utilization and yield improvement technologies at our manufacturing facilities 
in performance materials  longer term demand is driven primarily by the construction and infrastructure  automotive  electronics and consumer products industries 
in recent years  operating results in performance materials have been driven by i increases or decreases in sales volumes  ii our ability to deliver differentiated products that drive enhanced performance in customers applications  iii our ability to obtain value pricing for this differentiation  and iv the cost of new capacity 

table of contents in advanced technologies  drivers of demand are specific to the various businesses 
in the inkjet colorants business  demand has been driven by a relative increase of printer platforms using our pigments at both new and existing customers and the broader adoption of inkjet technology in office and commercial printing applications 
demand in the aerogel business has been driven by the adoption of aerogel products for oil and gas  daylighting and insulation for building  construction and industrial applications 
in the security materials business  demand has been driven principally by the number of security taggant applications incorporating our unique and proprietary particles 
in the elastomer composites business  operating results have been influenced by royalties and technology payments related to our patented technology that is used in tire applications 
in our specialty fluids business  demand for cesium formate is primarily driven by the level of drilling activity for high pressure oil and gas wells and by the petroleum industry s acceptance of our product as a drilling and completion fluid for this application 
operating results in advanced technologies have been influenced by i the rate at which we commercialize new technology  ii our ability to select the highest value opportunities and work with lead users in the appropriate markets  iii our ability to appropriately size the overall cost platform for the opportunities  iv the timing of royalty and technology payments in our elastomer composites business  and v the size  type and duration of drilling jobs in our specialty fluids business 
in purification solutions  longer term demand is driven primarily by the demand for activated carbon based solutions for water  gas and air  pharmaceuticals  food and beverages  catalysts and other chemical applications 
operating results in purification solutions have been influenced by i changes in pricing and product mix  ii industry capacity utilization  iii the amount of coal based power generation utilized in the us  and iv changes in volume in the various applications previously noted 
overview of results for fiscal during fiscal  profitability decreased compared to fiscal driven by lower unit margins that resulted from price decreases and a less favorable product mix  and lower volumes 
fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales and other operating revenue and gross profit years ended september dollars in millions net sales and other operating revenues gross profit the million increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to the addition of purification solutions approximately 
the improvement was partially offset by lower prices and a less favorable product mix combined million  the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation million  and lower volumes million 
the million increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal was driven primarily by higher prices and a favorable product mix combined million and the addition of two months of purification solutions sales approximately million partially offset by lower volumes million and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation million 
gross profit decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal driven by lower unit margins that resulted from price decreases and a less favorable product mix  and lower volumes 
gross profit increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal principally due to higher unit margins driven by the implementation of strategic value pricing and product mix initiatives and benefits from the investments in energy centers and yield technology that more than offset higher raw material costs 

table of contents selling and administrative expenses years ended september dollars in millions selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the comparative increase was principally driven by the addition of purification solutions and restructuring related charges 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the comparative increase is principally due to higher professional fees and other costs related to the acquisition and integration of norit million  the inclusion of two months of purification solutions operating results million  an increase in environmental and legal reserves million  including for respirator claims  and spending to support growth across our business 
research and technical expenses years ended september dollars in millions research and technical expenses research and technical expenses increased million in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to higher expenses related to the addition of purification solutions and restructuring related charges 
research and technical expenses increased million in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to fees for a new technology licensing agreement million  the inclusion of two months of purification solutions operating results million and higher spending to support business initiatives

cash flows and liquidity overview our liquidity position  as measured by cash and cash equivalents plus borrowing availability  decreased by million during fiscal the decrease was attributable to cash used to pay down debt partially offset by cash provided by lower working capital 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  and current availability under our revolving credit agreement of approximately million 
our revolving credit agreement contains affirmative  negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type 
the financial covenants in the revolving credit agreement include interest coverage  debt to ebitda and subsidiary debt to total capitalization ratios 
as of september   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
we generally manage our cash and debt on a global basis to provide for working capital requirements as needed by region or site 
cash and debt are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary holding the assets or liabilities  except where there are operational cash flow reasons to hold non functional currency or debt 
as of september   our us dollar cash and cash equivalent holdings by region were asia pacific million  europe million  and the americas million  which included million in the us in january  we initiated a commercial paper program allowing us to issue notes of various tenors up to days 
to date the interest on these notes has been lower than the interest that we would have paid on our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
the commercial paper program is backed by our committed revolving credit facility  and the aggregate borrowings under both the commercial paper program and revolving credit agreement cannot exceed the million limit on the revolving credit agreement 
we completed the acquisition of the remaining percent common stock equity of our mexican carbon black manufacturing joint venture  nhumo  sapi de sapi on november  at the closing  we paid approximately million in cash and received approximately million in cash as a special cash dividend from nhumo 
we anticipate sufficient liquidity from i cash on hand  ii cash flows from operating activities  and iii cash available from our revolving credit agreement and our commercial paper program to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future 
our liquidity derived from cash flows from operations is  to a large degree  predicated on our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  the cost of our raw materials  and our ability to manage inventory levels 

table of contents discontinued operations our consolidated statements of cash flows have been presented to include discontinued operations with continuing operations 
therefore  unless noted otherwise  the following discussion of our cash flows and liquidity position include both continuing and discontinued operations 
in january  we completed the sale of our supermetals business  which we classified as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal when we entered into the sale and purchase agreement for its sale 
in connection with the sale  we received million on the closing date and notes for additional minimum consideration totaling approximately million payable at various dates through the second quarter of fiscal through september   we have received million under the notes 
the following discussion of the changes in our cash balance refers to the various sections of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flows from operating activities cash generated by operating activities  which consists of net income adjusted for the various non cash items included in income  changes in working capital and changes in certain other balance sheet accounts  totaled million in fiscal operating activities provided million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash generated from operating activities in fiscal was driven primarily by net income of million plus million of depreciation and amortization and a decrease in working capital 
the increase in fiscal depreciation and amortization when compared to fiscal was driven primarily by higher amortization of intangible assets related to the fiscal acquisition of norit 
our fiscal working capital decrease when compared to fiscal was primarily driven by lower accounts receivable and lower inventories partially offset by lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash generated from operating activities in fiscal was driven primarily by net income of million plus million of depreciation and amortization and a decrease in working capital 
our fiscal working capital decrease when compared to fiscal was primarily driven by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by higher inventories

our working capital increase in fiscal was driven principally by higher pricing and raw material costs when compared to fiscal and is comprised of higher accounts receivable and inventories  offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
despite increased revenue  operating cash flows decreased in fiscal as a result of the corresponding growth of inventories  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
in addition to the working capital movements noted above  the following other elements of operations have had a bearing on operating cash flows restructurings as of september   we had million of total restructuring costs in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet related to our global restructuring activities 
we made cash payments of million during fiscal related to these restructuring plans 
we expect to make cash payments related to these restructuring activities of approximately million in fiscal and thereafter which includes the million already accrued in the consolidated balance sheet as of september  
we may receive cash in the future from the sale of certain assets and land relating to restructured sites  which is not included in these amounts 
environmental reserves and litigation matters we have recorded a million reserve on both a discounted and undiscounted basis as of september  for environmental remediation costs at

these sites are primarily associated with businesses divested in prior years 
we anticipate that the expenditures at these sites will be made over a number of years  and will not be concentrated in any one year 
additionally  as of september  we have recorded an million reserve on a discounted basis million on an undiscounted basis for respirator claims 
these expenditures will be incurred over many years 
we also have other litigation costs arising in the ordinary course of business 
the following table represents the estimated future undiscounted payments related to our environmental and respirator reserves 
future payments by fiscal year thereafter total dollars in millions environmental litigation respirator total cash flows from investing activities in fiscal  investing activities consumed million of cash and were primarily driven by capital expenditures of million partially offset by cash received from the notes receivable from the sale of the supermetals business million in total  comprised of million of principal and million of interest

partially offsetting these decreases were proceeds from the sale of our divested supermetals business and payments on notes relating to the sale totaling million 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in each of these years  expenditures were primarily related to expansion of our manufacturing footprint in the asia pacific region  sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities  investments in energy recovery technology  and capital spending required for process technology and product differentiation projects 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between million and million 
our planned capital spending program for fiscal is primarily for sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities  investments in energy related projects  and site development initiatives 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities consumed million of cash in fiscal compared to providing million of cash in fiscal and consuming million in fiscal during fiscal  we received net inflows of million from our commercial paper program  and used the majority of the proceeds to repay million on our revolving credit agreement

in fiscal the decrease in our net debt balance was primarily driven by the repayment of short term debt from cash generated from operations 
in january  we initiated a commercial paper program 
the majority of proceeds raised were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  which had a balance of million  included within long term debt in the consolidated balance sheets as of september  the outstanding balance of commercial paper of million as of september  is included within the notes payable caption on the consolidated balance sheets

these cash dividend payments totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal 
table of contents venezuela we own of an operating affiliate in venezuela  which is accounted for as an equity affiliate  through wholly owned subsidiaries that carry the investment and receive its dividends 
as of september   these subsidiaries carried the operating affiliate investment of million and held million bolivars million in cash 
in february  the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar from bolivars to the us dollar b to b 
accordingly  we remeasured the bolivar denominated monetary accounts in our wholly owned subsidiaries at the new rate  resulting in the recognition of a million loss in the second quarter of fiscal through other expense within the consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit of million from a reduction in the deferred tax liability due to the impact of the devaluation of the bolivar on unremitted earnings 
the operating affiliate recognized a million loss during fiscal year as a result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in bolivars and a charge of million from the tax impact of the currency devaluation mainly on us dollar and euro denominated cash and receivable balances 
our share of these combined losses was approximately million  which was included within the equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of tax line of the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year as a result of the currency devaluation  we performed an impairment analysis on our equity investment in venezuela during the second quarter of fiscal using the discounted cash flow model to determine its fair value 
we determined that there was no impairment to the carrying value of our equity investment 
we continue to closely monitor developments in venezuela and their potential impact on the recoverability of our equity affiliate investment 
during fiscal and  the operating affiliate declared dividends of million bolivars million and million bolivars million  respectively  to our wholly owned subsidiaries  which were paid in us dollars and repatriated 
the venezuelan bolivars held by our wholly owned subsidiaries may only be exchanged for foreign currencies through certain venezuelan government controlled channels 
the channels available are the venezuelan central bank cadivi  and venezuelan government and government backed bond offerings 
the bond offerings use a bidding process  where companies and individuals requiring us dollars place a request for a fixed sum  and cadivi then determines how to allocate the pool of us dollars in that issuance 
we closely monitor our ability to convert our bolivar holdings into us dollars  as we intend to convert substantially all bolivars held by our wholly owned subsidiaries in venezuela to us dollars as soon as practical 
any future change in the cadivi official rate or opening of additional parallel markets could lead us to change the exchange rate and result in gains or losses on the bolivar denominated assets held by our wholly owned subsidiaries and operating affiliate 
employee benefit plans as of september  we had a consolidated pension obligation  net of the fair value of plan assets  of million  comprised of million for pension benefit plan liabilities and million for postretirement benefit plan liabilities 
the million of unfunded pension benefit plan liabilities is derived as follows us foreign total dollars in millions fair value of plan assets benefit obligation unfunded status

for fiscal  we expect to make cash contributions of million to a us pension plan and approximately million to our foreign pension plans 
the million of unfunded postretirement benefit plan liabilities is comprised of million for our us and million for our foreign postretirement benefit plans 
these postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
typical of such plans  our postretirement plans are unfunded and  therefore  have no plan assets 
we fund these plans as claims or insurance premiums come due 
in fiscal  we paid postretirement benefits of million under our us postretirement plans and less than million under our foreign postretirement plans 
for fiscal  we expect to make benefit payments of approximately million under our us postretirement plans and million under our foreign postretirement plans 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no material transactions that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our long term contractual obligations  excluding those attributable to our discontinued operations  which are described in greater detail in note r in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
variable interest is based on the variable debt outstanding and prevailing variable interest rates as of september   and the table includes the impact of our interest rate swaps that change fixed rates to floating rates

purchase commitments we have entered into long term  volume based purchase agreements primarily for the purchase of raw materials and natural gas with various key suppliers in reinforcement materials  performance materials  and purification solutions 
under certain of these agreements the quantity of material being purchased is fixed  but the price we pay changes as market prices change 
for purposes of the table above  current purchase prices have been used to quantify total commitments 
capital leases we have capital lease obligations primarily for certain equipment and buildings 
these obligations are payable over the next years 

table of contents operating leases we have operating leases primarily comprised of leases for transportation vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  and machinery and equipment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through long and short term borrowings and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies 
changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flows and earnings 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have policies governing our use of derivative instruments  and we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
by using derivative instruments  we are subject to credit and market risk 
the derivative instruments are recorded to our balance sheet at fair market value and reflect the asset or liability position as of september  if a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our exposure will equal the fair value of the derivative 
generally  when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes cabot  thus creating a payment risk for cabot 
we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into these transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating 
as of september   the counterparties with which we have executed derivatives carried a standard and poor s credit rating between a and aa  inclusive 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 
foreign currency risk our international operations are subject to certain risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations and government actions 
foreign currency exposures also relate to assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary as well as the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows generated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we use short term forward contracts to minimize the exposure to foreign currency risk 
at september   we had million in net notional foreign currency contracts  which were denominated in the british pound sterling  chinese renminbi  czech koruna  and indian rupee 
these forwards had a fair value of less than million as of september  in certain situations where we have a long term commitment denominated in a foreign currency we may enter into appropriate financial instruments in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge future cash flow exposures
