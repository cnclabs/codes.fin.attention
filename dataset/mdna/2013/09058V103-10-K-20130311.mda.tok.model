item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains certain statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future financial performance of biocryst 
such statements are only predictions and the actual events or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  as well as those discussed in other filings made by biocryst with the securities and exchange commission 

table of contents the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report on form k including the disclosures under item a 
risk factors 
cautionary statement the discussion herein contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which are subject to the safe harbor created in section e 
forward looking statements regarding our financial condition and our results of operations that are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states  as well as projections for the future 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks common to biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our drug discovery  drug development and commercialization efforts  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory actions and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  competition associated with products  potential competition associated with our product candidates and retention of key employees 
in order for any of our product candidates to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us  or our collaborative partners  to conduct clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  and obtain market acceptance and adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate significant revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that we will have sufficient funding to meet our future capital requirements 
statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report which are not historical facts are  or may constitute  forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results 
the most significant known risks are discussed in the section entitled risk factors 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
our revenues are difficult to predict and depend on numerous factors  including the prevalence and severity of influenza in regions for which peramivir has received regulatory approval  severity of flu in those geographies that impact enrollment in our phase clinical trials  ongoing discussions with government agencies regarding future peramivir and or bcx development  as well as entering into  or modifying  licensing agreements for our product candidates 
furthermore  revenues related to our collaborative development activities are dependent upon the progress toward and the achievement of developmental milestones by us or our collaborative partners 
our operating expenses are also difficult to predict and depend on several factors  including research and development expenses  drug manufacturing  and clinical research activities  the ongoing requirements of our development programs  and the availability of capital and direction from regulatory agencies  which are difficult to predict 
management may be able to control the timing and level of research and development and general and administrative expenses  but many of these expenditures will occur irrespective of our actions due to contractually committed activities and or payments 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that our operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the prevailing market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
overview we are a biotechnology company that designs  optimizes and develops novel drugs that block key enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of diseases 
we focus on therapeutic areas with unmet medical needs that are of interest to us and aligned with our capabilities and expertise 
we integrate the disciplines of biology  crystallography  medicinal chemistry and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure guided drug design 
our strategy is to create a sustainable portfolio of commercial products and product candidates whereby we out license rights to product candidates in geographies or therapeutic areas where we do not intend to and or do not have the ability to commercialize them 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and the policies underlying these estimates on a periodic basis  as situations change  and regularly discuss financial events  policies  and issues with members of our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm 
we routinely evaluate our estimates and policies regarding revenue recognition  administration  inventory and manufacturing  taxes  stock based compensation  research and development  consulting and other expenses and any associated liabilities 
recent corporate highlights peramivir on november   we announced completion of the planned interim analysis of the peramivir phase clinical trial 
the clinical trial was a multicenter  randomized  double blind  controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mg iv peramivir administered once daily for five days in addition to soc  compared to soc alone  in adults and adolescents hospitalized due to serious influenza 
the difference between peramivir and control groups for the primary endpoint was small and the recalculated sample size was greater than the predefined futility boundary of subjects 
based on this information  the dmc recommended that the study be terminated for futility 
no unexpected adverse events were identified and the dmc expressed no concerns about the safety of peramivir 
we suspended enrollment in the clinical trial and subsequently terminated it 
during the first half of  we will conduct meetings and discussions with barda hhs and the fda to determine the appropriate future for the peramivir program 
at the conclusion of these meetings  the future development  if any  of peramivir in the us will be determined 
on february   barda hhs awarded us a million contract modification intended to fund completion of the phase development of iv peramivir for the treatment of patients hospitalized with influenza 
this contract modification brings the total award from barda hhs to million and extends the contract term by months through december  the contract  as it currently stands  provides for funding through completion of phase and to support the filing of an nda to seek regulatory approval for iv peramivir in the us through december   million has been recognized as revenue under this contract 
on march   we completed a million non recourse financing transaction designed to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under our license agreement with shionogi  pursuant to which shionogi licensed from us the rights to market peramivir rapiacta in japan and  if approved for commercial sale  taiwan 
we formed royalty sub  a newly created wholly owned subsidiary  which completed a private placement to institutional investors of million in aggregate principal amount of pharma senior secured notes 
this private placement was exempt from registration under the securities act of the pharma notes  which are obligations of royalty sub  are secured by i royalty sub s rights to receive royalty payments from shionogi in respect of commercial sales of rapiacta in japan and  if approved for commercial sale  taiwan  as well as future milestone payments payable by shionogi under the shionogi agreement and all of royalty sub s other assets  and ii a pledge by us of our equity interest in royalty sub 
principal and interest on the pharma notes issued by royalty sub are payable from  and are secured by  the rights to royalty and milestone payments under the shionogi agreement 
principal on the pharma notes is required to be paid in full by the final legal maturity date of december   unless the pharma notes are repaid  redeemed or repurchased earlier 
the pharma notes are redeemable by royalty sub beginning march  and bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable annually in arrears on september st of each year  beginning on september  royalty sub s obligations to pay principal and interest on the pharma notes are obligations solely of royalty sub and are without recourse to any other person  including us  except to the extent of our pledge of our equity interests in royalty sub in support of the pharma notes 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting transaction costs of million and the establishment of a million interest reserve account available to help cover future annual interest shortfalls 
as of december   the interest reserve account has been fully utilized 
furthermore  approximately  of accrued interest is in arrears from the september  payment date 
this shortfall accrues interest at the coupon rate and must be paid by september  or the pharma notes will be in default 
we expect royalty payments from sales of rapiacta in to satisfy the interest in arrears 
however  based upon historical rapiacta sales in japan and the interest currently in arrears  it is uncertain whether rapiacta royalties will be sufficient to pay all interest in arrears and all interest due on the september  payment date 

table of contents in association with the pharma notes  we entered into a currency hedge agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
under this agreement  we have the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of yen per dollar for which we may be required to pay a premium in each year from through  provided the currency hedge agreement remains in effect 
a payment of million will be required if  on may of the relevant year  the us dollar is worth yen or less as determined in accordance with the currency hedge agreement 
in conjunction with establishing the currency hedge agreement  we will be required to post collateral to the counterparty  which may cause us to experience additional quarterly volatility in our financial results 
we will not be required at any time to post collateral exceeding the maximum premium payments remaining payable under the currency hedge agreement 
subject to certain obligations we have in connection with the pharma notes  we have the right to terminate the currency hedge agreement with respect to the through period by giving notice to the counterparty prior to may  and paying a million termination fee 
in advance of the may  termination date  we have a limitation on the maximum hedge collateral of approximately million 
the currency hedge agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore mark to market adjustments will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
cumulative mark to market adjustments through december  resulted in a million hedge loss and we posted million in aggregate collateral based on defined thresholds 
our operating results will continue to be impacted by mark to market adjustments while the currency hedge agreement remains in effect 
ulodesine on july   we announced favorable week safety results and sustained efficacy from the extension phase of the randomized phase b clinical trial of ulodesine added to allopurinol in patients with gout who had failed to reach the sua therapeutic goal of mg dl on allopurinol alone  as well as positive phase safety results in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
the approximate doubling of sua response rates with ulodesine seen at weeks was sustained through weeks of treatment 
after weeks of treatment  ulodesine doses of mg  mg  and mg day showed response rates of  and respectively  compared to for placebo 
these results are consistent with the previously reported positive findings at the week primary efficacy time point 
with the results of the clinical trial  we have now concluded phase testing and are in out license discussions with potential partners for the continued phase development of ulodesine and its eventual commercialization on a worldwide basis 
due to the cost of phase development and commercialization  we do not plan to initiate phase development of ulodesine without a partner 
although we expect these out license discussions to continue in  we cannot predict the outcome or timing associated with completing an out licensing transaction 
forodesine on november   we entered into the amended and restated license and development agreement with mundipharma  amending and restating the february  exclusive  royalty bearing development and license agreement for the development and commercialization of forodesine for use in the field of oncology 
under the terms of the amended and restated agreement  mundipharma obtained worldwide rights to forodesine  so they now control the worldwide development and commercialization of forodesine and assume all future development and commercialization costs 
additionally  on november   we further amended our agreements with aecom irl whereby aecom irl agreed to accept a reduction of one half in the percentage of net proceeds as defined in the amended and restated agreement received by us under our amended and restated agreement with mundipharma 
the amended and restated agreement is a multiple element arrangement for accounting purposes in which we are required to deliver to mundipharma both the worldwide rights to forodesine and the transfer of product data and know how to permit mundipharma to develop and commercialize forodesine the knowledge transfer 
the world wide license rights were granted to mundipharma upon execution of amended and restated agreement and the knowledge transfer and the product data and know how transfer were completed in the first quarter of we have accounted for these elements as a combined unit of accounting as neither one has stand alone value to mundipharma 
upon completion of the knowledge transfer  the unamortized deferred revenue and deferred expense of million and million  respectively  was recognized in our statements of comprehensive loss in the quarter ended march  results of operations year ended december  compared to total revenues increased to million as compared to revenues of million 
revenues in included the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue associated with the amended and restated license and development agreement with mundipharma 
the recognition of this revenue and the related expense noted below did not impact our cash balance 
the remaining revenue consisted of million of royalty revenue from shionogi sales of 
table of contents rapiacta  million of reimbursement of collaborative expenses from barda hhs related to the development of iv peramivir and million associated with collaborative revenue amortization from other corporate partnerships 
revenue increased in due to the recognition of all previously deferred revenue associated with the mundipharma agreement as well as the recognition of rapiacta royalty revenue  for which no royalty was recognized in these two increases were partially offset by decreased barda hhs revenue  as compared to  associated with a lower rate of enrollment in the clinical trial compared to revenues in consisted of million of reimbursement of collaborative expenses from barda hhs related to the continued development of iv peramivir and million associated with collaborative revenue amortization from other corporate partnerships 
research and development r d expenses decreased to million in from million in the prior year 
approximately million of the r d expense resulted from the recognition of previously deferred expenses associated with the amended and restated license and development agreement with mundipharma 
the remaining r d expenses  compared with the prior year  reflect decreased spending associated with our ulodesine and peramivir programs partially offset by increased spending on our pre clinical compounds primarily bcx and bcx 
in connection with the amended and restated license and development agreement with mundipharma  we do not expect to incur any significant forodesine costs in the future 
furthermore  with the completion of phase testing of ulodesine in  we do not expect to incur significant ulodesine expenses in the future  because we do not plan to initiate phase development of ulodesine without a partner 
the following table summarizes our r d expenses for the periods indicated amounts are in thousands 
r d expenses by program ulodesine peramivir bcx bcx forodesine bcx other research  preclinical and development costs total r d expenses research and development expenses include all direct and indirect expenses and are allocated to specific programs at the point of development of a lead product candidate 
direct expenses are charged directly to the program to which they relate and indirect expenses are allocated based upon internal direct labor hours dedicated to each respective program 
direct expenses consist of compensation for r d personnel and costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  develop manufacturing processes  manufacture the product candidates  conduct and manage clinical trials  patent related costs  as well as other costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
indirect r d expenses consist of lab supplies and services  facility expenses  depreciation of development equipment and other overhead of our research and development efforts 
r d expenses vary according to the number of programs in clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs 
later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs due to the longer length of time of the clinical trials and the higher number of patients enrolled in these clinical trials 
general and administrative g a expenses decreased to million in compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease of million is primarily due to the continued realization of cost containment measures yielding a reduction of non critical consulting and other administrative expenses  as well as avoidance of one time expenses incurred in the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
these reductions were offset somewhat by million of transaction costs associated with the proposed merger with presidio pharmaceuticals  inc interest expense related to the non recourse notes issued in conjunction with the peramivir royalty monetization transaction in march increased to million in as compared to million in  due to recognizing a full year of interest expense in compared to a partial year in in addition  a mark to market loss of million was recognized in related to our foreign currency hedge  compared to a mark to market loss of million in the prior year  resulting from changes in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate 
we entered into the foreign currency hedge agreement to hedge changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
the currency hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore mark to market adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
although we cannot predict the future yen dollar exchange rate  the applicable foreign currency rates have moved such that 
table of contents we have reclaimed hedge collateral in early  however  it is possible that additional collateral will be required in we are unable to predict future changes in the yen dollar exchange rate or increases decreases in our hedge loss associated with the currency hedge agreement 
restructuring in december  we announced that we had restructured our operations during the fourth quarter of to significantly reduce the size and operations of our company in order to extend our existing cash runway 
we eliminated approximately of our workforce and decreased other costs  which will decrease our operating cash utilization by to and decrease our operating expenses by to  as compared to levels 
these changes will allow our existing cash and investments to last longer and enable us to achieve important near term milestones 
based upon these changes  we anticipate our cash and investments will fund our operations for to months  and thus into the second quarter of in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million for the year ended december   which are reported in a separate line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
significant components of the restructuring charge were termination benefits for employees impacted by the restructuring and losses associated with leased lab and office space that is now vacant 
we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring changes as a result of our december restructuring 
in addition  we restructured our operations in and incurred approximately million of charges when we executed that restructuring 
significant components of our restructuring were the write off of assets and termination benefits for employees impacted by the restructuring 
year ended december  compared to total revenues decreased to million as compared to revenues of million 
revenues in consisted primarily of reimbursement of collaboration expenses from barda hhs with million related to the continued development of iv peramivir and approximately million associated with collaborative revenue amortization from other corporate partnerships 
revenues in consisted primarily of reimbursement of collaboration expenses  including million from barda hhs for the continued development of iv peramivir and the sale of million of peramivir active pharmaceutical ingredient api and other starting materials to shionogi and green cross  as well as a million milestone payment from shionogi related to the marketing and manufacturing approval of rapiacta in japan during the first quarter of revenue associated with reimbursement from barda hhs for the continued development of iv peramivir decreased million in as compared to the decrease in revenue associated with our peramivir development program resulted from the completion of two clinical trials in and the realignment of ongoing clinical trials 
in addition  the decrease was also partially related to an estimate revision of prior period expenses for a peramivir clinical trial associated with services performed by a contract research organization cro  and its subsequent revision of service costs in related to a final cost reconciliation 
at the end of  we estimated expenses related to this clinical trial and the associated revenue we expected to receive from barda hhs from estimates provided to us by this cro 
revisions to the estimated costs resulted in a million reduction of peramivir expenses and a million reduction to collaboration revenue during the first quarter of  resulting in a net impact of million to net loss 
research and development expenses decreased to million in as compared to million for the prior year 
the million decrease was driven by lower development costs associated with our peramivir development program as discussed above and lower costs associated with our forodesine clinical programs 
in connection with the amended and restated agreement with mundipharma  we ceased incurring all forodesine development costs in november and we received million for previously expensed compound development costs 
the decrease in aforementioned costs was partially offset by higher development costs associated with the ulodesine program for the treatment of gout during additionally  peramivir costs for included million of manufacturing costs associated with peramivir api production for shionogi and green cross 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million in the small change reflects timing of expenses between the years associated with the transition of our headquarters to durham  north carolina and cost containment procedures instituted in additionally  we incurred interest expense and losses on our foreign currency derivative during  associated with our million non recourse debt financing transaction completed in march to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments associated with a license agreement with shionogi see note royalty monetization in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we incurred million in interest expense related to our pharma notes and recognized a million mark to market loss related to our currency hedge agreement 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since our inception and we expect our operating expenses to exceed our revenues 
our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity securities  cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements  including government contracts  and to a lesser extent  the pharma notes financing 
on february   we announced that barda hhs had awarded us a million contract modification intended to fund completion of the phase development of iv peramivir  bringing the total award from barda hhs to million and extending the contract term by months through december  on march   we completed a million non recourse debt financing transaction designed to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under our license agreement with shionogi 
we received net proceeds from this transaction of approximately million  excluding hedge collateral posted subsequent to the closing of the transaction 
in june  we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement the atm agreement with mcnicoll  lewis vlak mlv pursuant to which we may issue and sell million in shares of our common stock at current market prices under a form s registration statement with mlv acting as the sales agent 
as of december   we have sold an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an average per share price of pursuant to the atm agreement for net proceeds of million 
in addition to the above we have received funding from other sources  including other collaborative and other research and development agreements  government grants  equipment lease financing  facility leases  research grants  and interest income on our investments 
as of december   we had net working capital of million  a decrease of approximately million from million at december  the decrease in working capital was principally due to funding of our normal operating expenses associated with the development of our product candidates and million in cash collateral posted against foreign currency losses which was partially offset by million in net proceeds derived from the sale of common stock through offerings under the atm agreement through our form s shelf registration 
our principal sources of liquidity at december  were approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  approximately million in investments considered available for sale  and approximately million in barda hhs receivables 
in december  we announced that we had restructured our operations to significantly reduce the size and operations of our company in order to extend our existing cash runway 
we eliminated approximately of our workforce and decreased other costs  which we anticipate will decrease our operating cash utilization by to and decrease our operating expenses by to  as compared to levels 
these changes will allow our existing cash and investments to last longer and enable us to achieve important near term milestones 
based upon these changes  we anticipate our cash and investments will fund our operations for to months  and thus into the second quarter of we intend to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by closely managing our third party costs and headcount  leasing scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development projects and using consultants 
we expect to incur additional expenses  potentially resulting in significant losses  as we continue to pursue our research and development activities  primarily related to our clinical trial activity 
we may incur additional expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical programs advance through later stages of development 
the objective of our investment policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds  as well as maintaining liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements 
we place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies  and government agencies in order to limit the amount of our credit exposure 
we have not realized any significant losses on our investments 
at december   we had long term operating lease obligations  which provide for aggregate minimum payments of approximately million in  million in and million in these obligations include the future rental of our operating facilities 
we plan to finance our needs principally from the following lease or loan financing and future public or private equity financing  our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital  payments under our contract with barda hhs  and payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners 
as our programs continue to advance  our costs will increase 
our current and planned clinical trials  plus the related development  manufacturing  regulatory approval process requirements and additional personnel resources and testing required for the continuing development of our product candidates will consume significant capital resources and will increase our expenses 
our expenses  revenues and cash utilization rate could vary significantly depending on many factors  including our ability to raise additional capital  the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our product candidates  the 
table of contents amount and timing of funding we receive from barda hhs for peramivir  the amount of funding or assistance  if any  we receive from other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our product candidates  the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced product candidates  the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead product candidates and the progression of our other programs 
with the funds available at december   we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into the second quarter of our future liquidity needs  and ability to address those needs  will largely be determined by the success of our product candidates and key development and regulatory events in the future 
in order to continue our operations substantially beyond mid  we will need to successfully secure  or increase us government funding of our programs  out license rights to certain of our product candidates  pursuant to which the we would receive cash milestones  raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or from other sources  obtain product candidate regulatory approvals  which would generate revenue and cash flow  reduce spending on one or more research and development programs  and or restructure operations 
additionally  we retain the ability to offer for sale approximately million of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and securities warrants from an effective shelf registration statement  which we filed with the sec on june  our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including our ability to perform under the contract with barda hhs and receive reimbursement  the magnitude of work under the contract with barda hhs  the progress and magnitude of our research  drug discovery and development programs  changes in existing collaborative relationships or government contracts  our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships with academic institutions  biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties  the extent to which our partners  including governmental agencies  will share in the costs associated with the development of our programs or run the development programs themselves  our ability to negotiate favorable development and marketing strategic alliances for certain product candidates or a decision to build or expand internal development and commercial capabilities  successful commercialization of marketed products by either us or a partner  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify and develop product candidates  our ability to engage sites and enroll subjects in our clinical trials  the scope of manufacturing of our product candidates to support our preclinical research and clinical trials  increases in personnel and related costs to support the development of our product candidates  the scope of manufacturing of our drug substance and drug products required for future nda filings  competitive and technological advances  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and the costs involved in all aspects of intellectual property strategy and protection including the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
we expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates and we may seek to raise capital at any time 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of equity or debt securities  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  including governmental agencies in general and from the barda hhs contract specifically  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us 
table of contents to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
our future working capital requirements  including the need for additional working capital  will be largely determined by the advancement of our portfolio of product candidates as well as rate of reimbursement by barda hhs of our peramivir expenses and any future decisions regarding the future of the peramivir development program 
more specifically  our working capital requirements will be dependent on the number  magnitude  scope and timing of our development programs  regulatory approval of our product candidates  obtaining funding from collaborative partners  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  regulatory investigations  and changes in regulatory requirements  the costs of obtaining patent protection for our product candidates  the timing and terms of business development activities  the rate of technological advances relevant to our operations  the efficiency of manufacturing processes developed on our behalf by third parties  and the level of required administrative support for our daily operations 
financial outlook for based upon our strategic and development operations  we expect operating cash usage to be in the range of to million  and expect our total operating expenses to be in the range of to million 
our operating cash forecast excludes any impact of our royalty monetization  hedge collateral posted or returned  sale of stock in the marketplace  and any other non routine cash outflows or inflows  such as restructuring and transaction costs 
our ability to remain within our operating expense and operating cash target ranges is subject to multiple factors  including unanticipated or additional general development and administrative costs and other factors described under the risk factors located elsewhere in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated entities or off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations contingent license obligations non recourse notes payable total purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  manufacturing and research operations and other purchase commitments 
assumes the pharma notes will be repaid at maturity and the related interest costs will accrue and be paid annually through maturity 
this assumption is based on the unpredictable nature of the royalty payments from shionogi which are designated for both principal and interest payments on the pharma notes 
under the currency hedge agreement  we have the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of yen per dollar for which we may be required to pay a premium in each year from through  provided the currency hedge agreement is still in effect 
a payment of million will be required if  during the relevant year  the dollar is worth less than yen 
we have the right to terminate the currency hedge agreement with respect to through by giving notice on may  and a payment of a million termination fee 
prior to termination  the maximum amount of hedge collateral we may be required to post is million 
as of december   we have posted million in hedge collateral 
because the posting of additional collateral and payment of annual premiums is contingent on the value of the yen relative to the dollar and other factors  such payments have been excluded from the foregoing table 

table of contents in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future sublicense payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which were utilized in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
inventory our inventories consist of peramivir finished goods and supplies for the manufacture of peramivir  which are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out ie  fifo method 
cost includes materials  labor  overhead  shipping and handling costs 
our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and provide valuation reserves for any estimated obsolete  short dated or unmarketable inventories 
in addition  we may experience spoilage of our raw materials and supplies 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance for all inventory balances at december  accrued expenses we enter into contractual agreements with third party vendors who provide research and development  manufacturing  and other services in the ordinary course of business 
some of these contracts are subject to milestone based invoicing and services are completed over an extended period of time 
we record liabilities under these contractual commitments when an obligation has been incurred 
this accrual process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to cros in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  and professional fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of these costs  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues from collaborative and other research and development arrangements and product sales 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
collaborative and other research and development arrangements and royalties revenue from license fees  royalty payments  event payments  and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement 
fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed 
in the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting 
revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively 
under certain of our license agreements  we receive royalty payments based upon our licensees net sales of covered products 
generally  under these agreements  we receive royalty reports from our licensees approximately one quarter in arrears  that is  generally in the second month of the quarter after the licensee has sold the royalty bearing product 
we recognize royalty revenues when we can reliably estimate such amounts and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue paid by shionogi on their product sales is subject to returns 
reimbursements received for direct out of pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses 
event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are non refundable and non creditable 
any event payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
under our contract with barda hhs  revenue is recognized as reimbursable direct and indirect costs are incurred 
product sales product sales are recognized net of estimated allowances  discounts  sales returns  chargebacks and rebates 
research and development expenses our research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts are recognized as expense when the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
research and development expenses include  among other items  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  manufacturing costs  clinical  regulatory  and toxicology services performed by cros  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs 
most of our manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party cros 
costs for studies performed by cros are accrued by us over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of services actually performed 
additionally  we have license agreements with third parties  such as aecom  irl  and uab  which require fees related to sublicense agreements or maintenance fees 
we expense sublicense payments as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred  in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period 
we expense maintenance payments as incurred 
at december   we had deferred collaboration expenses of approximately million 
these deferred expenses were sub license payments  paid to our academic partners upon receipt of consideration from various commercial partners  and other consideration to our academic partners for modification to existing license agreements 
these deferred expenses would not have been incurred without receipt of such payments or modifications from our commercial partners and are being expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized 
we believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue 

table of contents we group our r d expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and indirect expenses 
direct expenses consist of compensation for r d personnel and costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate  conduct and manage clinical trials  patent related costs  as well as other costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by program 
indirect expenses consist of lab supplies and services  facility expenses  depreciation of development equipment and other overhead of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
stock based compensation all share based payments  including grants of stock option awards and restricted stock awards  are recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss based on their fair values 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment  including estimating the life of an award  the stock price volatility  and the expected term 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to value our awards and recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting periods 
the estimation of share based payment awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
significant management judgment is also required in determining estimates of future stock price volatility and forfeitures to be used in the valuation of the options 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
foreign currency hedge in connection with our issuance of the pharma notes  we entered into a foreign currency hedge agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
under the currency hedge agreement  we have the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of yen per dollar for which we may be required to pay a premium in each year from through  provided the currency hedge agreement remains in effect 
a payment of million will be required if  on may of the relevant year  the us dollar is worth yen or less as determined in accordance with the currency hedge agreement 
in conjunction with establishing the currency hedge agreement  we will be required to post collateral to the counterparty  which may cause us to experience additional quarterly volatility in our financial results 
we will not be required at any time to post collateral exceeding the maximum premium payments remaining payable under the currency hedge agreements 
in establishing the hedge  we provided initial funds of approximately million to support our potential hedge obligations 
subject to certain obligations we have in connection with the pharma notes  we have the right to terminate the currency hedge agreement with respect to the through period by giving notice to the counterparty prior to may  and payment of a million termination fee 
prior to this termination date  the maximum amount of hedge collateral we may be required to post is million 
the currency hedge agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore mark to market adjustments will be recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
cumulative mark to market adjustments for the year ended december  resulted in a  loss 
mark to market adjustments are determined by quoted prices in markets that are not actively traded and for which significant inputs are observable directly or indirectly  representing the level in the fair value hierarchy as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
the company is also required to post collateral in connection with the mark to market adjustments based on defined thresholds and as of december   million was posted under the agreement 
tax we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against all potential tax assets  due to uncertainties in our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially impacted by inflation during the past three years 
however  we cannot be assured that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
we will continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation on the services that we use through improved operating efficiencies and cost containment initiatives

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio and borrowings under our pharma notes 
we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve capital  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies  and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
our investment exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our portfolio  changes in the market value due to changes in interest rates and other market factors as well as the increase or decrease in any realized gains and losses 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments to maturity and therefore do not expect that our operating results  financial position or cash flows will be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
however  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or other factors  such as changes in credit risk related to the securities issuers 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we do not believe that we have material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
generally  our investments are not collateralized 
we have not realized any significant losses from our investments 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
foreign currency risk in connection with the issuance by royalty sub of the pharma notes  we entered into a currency hedge agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
under the currency hedge agreement  we are required to post collateral based on our potential obligations under the currency hedge agreement as determined by periodic mark to market adjustments 
provided the currency hedge agreement remains in effect  we may be required to pay a premium in the amount of million in each year beginning in may and continuing through may such payment will be required if  in may of the relevant year  the spot rate of exchange for japanese yen us dollars determined in accordance with the currency hedge agreement is such that the us dollar is worth yen or less
