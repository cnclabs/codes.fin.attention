the company received million of cash proceeds in from the settlement of the forward stock purchase contracts element of the equity units that were issued by the company in march cash payments for dividends were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash dividends in was primarily attributable to the increase in dividends per common share to per share  as announced in july the dividend paid to shareholders of record in december extended the company record for the longest consecutive annual and quarterly dividend payments among industrial companies listed on the new york stock exchange 
the increase in cash dividend payments versus was attributable to a previous increase in dividends per common share to per share from in credit ratings and liquidity the company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major us rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt average a  as well as its short term commercial paper borrowings 
there have been no changes to any of the ratings during failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the company s cost of funds  liquidity and access to capital markets  but would not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to access committed credit facilities 
in march  the company entered into a new four year billion committed credit facility the credit agreement  which replaced all formerly existing credit facilities 
borrowings under the credit agreement may include us dollars up to the billion commitment or in euro or pounds sterling subject to a foreign currency sub limit of million and bear interest at a floating rate dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing

cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december   comprised of million in the us and million in foreign jurisdictions 
as of december  cash and cash equivalents totaled million  comprised of million in the us and million in foreign jurisdictions 
concurrent with the black decker merger  the company made a determination to repatriate certain legacy black decker foreign earnings  on which us income taxes had not previously been provided 
as a result of this repatriation decision  the company has recorded approximately million of associated deferred tax liabilities at december  current plans and liquidity requirements do not demonstrate a need to repatriate other foreign earnings 
accordingly  all other undistributed foreign earnings of the company are considered to be permanently reinvested  or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax  consistent with the company s overall growth strategy internationally  including acquisitions and long term financial objectives 
no provision has been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of these undistributed foreign earnings 
however  should management determine at a later point to repatriate additional foreign earnings  the company would be required to accrue and pay taxes at that time 
contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity payments due by period millions of dollars total thereafter long term debt a interest payments on long term debt b operating leases inventory purchase commitments c deferred compensation marketing obligations derivatives d forward stock purchase contract e pension funding obligations f total contractual cash obligations a future payments on long term debt encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities  excluding certain fair value adjustments included in long term debt  as discussed further in note h  long term debt and financing arrangements 
b future interest payments on long term debt reflect the applicable fixed interest rate or the variable rate in effect at december  for floating rate debt 
c inventory purchase commitments primarily consist of open purchase orders to purchase raw materials  components  and sourced products 
d future cash flows on derivative instruments reflect the fair value as of december  the ultimate cash flows on these instruments will differ  perhaps significantly  based on applicable market interest and foreign currency rates at their maturity 
e the company was obligated to pay million to the financial institution counterparty to the forward stock purchase contract in august  but elected to do so in january see note j  capital stock  for further discussion 
f this amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or  with respect to unfunded plans  necessary to fund current benefits 
the company has not presented estimated pension and post retirement funding in the table above beyond as funding can vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets  actuarial assumptions  and curtailment settlement actions 
to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities  the related amount will be included in the table above 
however  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the million of such liabilities at december   the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when if at all amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities 
aside from debt payments  for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of principal  tax obligations and the equity purchase contract fees  payment of the above contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts indicated

market risk market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments  currencies  commodities and other items traded in global markets 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  stock prices  and commodity prices 
exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company  through its global businesses  enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies 
the company s predominant exposures are in european  canadian  british  australian  latin american  and asian currencies  including the chinese renminbi rmb and the taiwan dollar 
certain cross currency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities as well as affiliate cross border activity are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include purchased basket options  purchased options  collars  cross currency swaps and currency forwards 
the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection 
at times  the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchased options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables  predominately for affiliate transactions 
gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures  assets and liabilities being hedged 
management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities  and in certain cases  may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain un hedged 
the company has also entered into cross currency swaps and forward contracts  to provide a partial hedge of the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements 
management estimates the foreign currency impact from these financial instruments at the end of would have been approximately a million pre tax loss based on a hypothetical adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions  this effect would occur from depreciation of the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions  and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes 
the company does not hedge the translation of its non us dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries 
as mentioned above  the company routinely has cross border trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements 
the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into us dollars 
it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects 
aside from the use of derivative instruments which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure  transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take  for example  if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a us supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier 
management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact of a overall movement in exchange rates is approximately million  or per diluted share 
the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was approximately unfavorable in  favorable in  and favorable in the company s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations  short term investments  and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio 
the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt  is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps  and cross currency swaps 
the company s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt and derivatives in the us and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates 
at december   the impact of a hypothetical increase in the interest rates associated with the company s floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses  particularly brass  nickel  resin  aluminum  copper  zinc  steel  and energy used in the production of finished goods 
generally  commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments  but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions  procurement driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects 
the company experienced inflation  primarily commodity related  of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
price erosion has also occurred in and  in addition to inflation  with a cumulative unfavorable impact of million 
the impact of inflation is expected to continue in  with cost and pricing actions being aggressively pursued to offset any adverse impact on operations 
fluctuations in the fair value of the company s common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed in the esop section of md a 
additionally  the company has million of liabilities as of december  pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain us employees for which there is mark to market exposure 
the assets held by the company s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities  primarily global stocks and fixed income securities 
the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values  although such funding would occur over a period of many years 
in  and  there were million  million and million  respectively  in investment returns on pension plan assets 
the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately million in the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk 
management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate 
the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world 
there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating 
the company s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity  including operating cash flows  are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal 
accordingly  based on present conditions and past history  management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur 
the company believes that its strong financial position  operating cash flows  committed long term credit facilities and borrowing capacity  and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments  to invest in the routine needs of its businesses  to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings 
other matters employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note l  employee benefit plans  the company has an esop under which the ongoing us cornerstone and k defined contribution plans are funded 
overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company s stock on the monthly dates when shares are released  among other factors 
the company s net esop activity resulted in expense of million in  million in and million in the esop expense increased in compared to due to the merger of the black decker us defined contribution plan into the esop in esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company s common stock declines 
critical accounting estimates preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a  significant accounting policies 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty 
the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations 
in these cases  management uses its judgment  based on the surrounding facts and circumstances  to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
second  a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change  for example  due to the occurrence of higher than expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company  estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced 
inventories lower of cost or market  slow moving and obsolete inventories in the us are predominantly valued at the lower of lifo cost or market  while non us inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market 
the calculation of lifo reserves  and therefore the net inventory valuation  is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components 
the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stock keeping units skus to determine that these items are properly valued 
the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete and or slow moving inventories 
inventory items identified as obsolete and or slow moving are evaluated to determine if write downs are required 
the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost 
if it is determined that cost is less than market value  cost is used for inventory valuation 
if market value is less than cost  the company writes down the related inventory to that value 
if a write down to the current market value is necessary  the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value  or ceiling defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose  and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin  also called the floor 
if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value  further write downs would be recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets 
the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc goodwill acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
the company reported billion of goodwill  billion of indefinite lived trade names and billion of definite lived intangibles at december  management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc  segment reporting  or one level below an operating segment component level as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of a operating segment having similar economic characteristics 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit including the value of goodwill is greater than its fair value  an impairment may exist 
an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 
the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model 
the key assumptions used are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections 
also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation are near term revenue growth rates over the next five years 
these assumptions contemplate business  market and overall economic conditions 
the fair value of indefinite lived trade names is also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
the key assumptions used include discount rates  royalty rates  and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales 
as required by the company s policy  goodwill and indefinite lived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of based on this testing  the company determined that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite lived trade names exceeded their respective carrying values 
the discount rates used in testing goodwill ranged from to 
the near term growth rates and perpetual growth rates  which varied for each reporting unit  ranged from approximately to and to  respectively 
management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flows valuation utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate in all reporting units 
the discount rate was decreased by basis points with no impairment indicated 
the perpetual growth rates were decreased by basis points with no impairment indicated 
based upon the company s annual impairment testing analysis  including the consideration of reasonably likely adverse changes in assumptions described above  management believes it is not reasonably likely that an impairment will occur in any of the reporting units over the next twelve months 
in the event that the company s operating results in the future do not meet current expectations  management  based upon conditions at the time  would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize profitability 
accordingly  the above sensitivity analysis  while a useful tool  should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment 
a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss was appropriate 
defined benefit obligations the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions 
these assumptions  which are updated annually  include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  future salary increase rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company considers current market conditions  including interest rates  to establish these assumptions 
discount rates are developed considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations 
the company s weighted average discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were and  respectively at december  the company s weighted average discount rate for the united states and international pension plans was and  respectively at december  as discussed further in note l  employee benefit plans  the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors  which include its targeted asset allocation percentages  historic returns  and expected future returns 
for  net periodic benefit cost the company s expected rate of return assumption was for both united states and international plans 
the company will use a weighted average expected rate of return assumption to determine the net periodic benefit cost 
a basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase net periodic benefit cost by approximately million  pre tax 
the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
to the extent that actual newly measured results differ from the actuarial assumptions  the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized over future periods 
the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets 
accordingly  market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year 
the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million at december  a basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately million at december  the primary black decker u 
s pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late  as well as the only material black decker international plan  and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans 
the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen  the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions 
the company recognized million of defined benefit plan expense in  which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets 
environmental the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites 
future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company s expenditures related to routine environmental matters 
the company s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
as of december   the company had reserves of million for remediation activities associated with company owned properties as well as for superfund sites  for losses that are probable and estimable 
the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is million to million which is subject to change in the near term 
the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns 
liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized  using enacted tax rates  for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers all positive and negative evidence including  estimates of future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies  the realizability of tax loss carry forwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 
by contrast  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made 
the company is subject to tax in a number of locations  including many state and foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required when calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the company unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next months 
these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters 
the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information  which involves inherent uncertainty 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority under the premise that the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations

risk insurance to manage its insurance costs efficiently  the company self insures for certain us business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally 
for domestic workers compensation  automobile and product liability liability for alleged injuries associated with the company s products  the company generally purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses stop loss insurance and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates 
while different stop loss deductibles exist for each of these lines of insurance  the maximum stop loss deductible is set at no more than million per occurrence and million in the aggregate per annum 
the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company s specific loss history  actual claims reported  and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required 
risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims  as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value 
the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a maximum of years 
the company believes the liabilities recorded for these us risk insurance reserves  totaling million and million as of december   and december   respectively  are adequate 
due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate 
warranty the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses 
the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime  while certain products carry no warranty 
further  the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues 
historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized 
adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available 
the company believes the million reserve for expected warranty claims as of december  is adequate  but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process  including forecasting future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims  the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability 
the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a product specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies 
off balance sheet arrangement synthetic leases the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for one of its major distribution centers and certain us personal property  predominately vehicles and equipment 
the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes  such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are off balance sheet 
these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility 
the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the million of rent expense recognized in fiscal as of december  the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were million and million  respectively
