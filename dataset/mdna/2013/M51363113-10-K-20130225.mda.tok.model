item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in the section entitled risk factors 
overview general we are a fabless semiconductor company that produces and supplies high performance connectivity products that facilitate efficient data transmission between servers  storage systems and communications infrastructure equipment and other embedded systems 
we offer adapter  gateway and switch ics  adapter cards  switch systems  long haul systems gateway systems  software  services and cables as an integral part of a total end to end networking solution focused on computing  storage and communication applications used in multiple markets  including high performance computing  or hpc  web  storage  financial services  database and cloud 
our adapters and switch ics provide per port bandwidth up to gb s  gb s and gb s ethernet  and gb s single data rate or sdr  gb s double data rate or ddr  gb s quad data rate or qdr and gb s fourteen data rate or fdr infiniband 
our switch systems range in port density from    and port top of rack switches to director class switches ranging in size from to ports 
connectivity between the adapters and switches is supported with our short reach copper cables and long reach active optical cables  and our management software provides visibility  monitoring and diagnostics for the system 
we are one of the pioneers of infiniband  an industry standard architecture that provides specifications for high performance interconnects 
we believe infiniband interconnect solutions deliver industry leading performance  efficiency and scalability of clustered computing and storage systems that incorporate our products 
in addition to supporting infiniband  our products also support industry standard ethernet transmission protocols providing unique product differentiation and connectivity flexibility 
our products serve as building blocks for creating reliable and scalable infiniband and ethernet solutions with leading performance 

table of contents we have experienced growth in our total revenues in each of the last three years 
our revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million to million to million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in order to increase our annual revenues  we must continue to achieve design wins over other infiniband and ethernet providers and providers of competing interconnect technologies 
we consider a design win to occur when an original equipment manufacturer  or oem  or contract manufacturer notifies us that it has selected our products to be incorporated into a product or system under development 
because the life cycles for our customers products can last for several years if these products have successful commercial introductions  we expect to continue to generate revenues over an extended period of time for each successful design win 
revenues 
we derive revenues from sales of our ics  cards  switch systems  cables  software and accessories 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
to date  we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers 
sales to our top ten customers represented  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to customers representing or more of revenues accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss of one or more of our principal customers or the reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by one of these customers could cause our revenues to decline materially if we are unable to increase our revenues from other customers 
our customers  including our most significant customers  are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our products and may cancel orders with limited potential penalties 
if any of our large customers reduces or cancels its purchases from us for any reason  it could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
at december  and december   based on information filed with the sec or reported to us  oracle held approximately million of our ordinary shares 
sales to oracle mainly through its contract manufacturers during and were million and million  respectively  and were conducted at arm length 
at december  and  accounts receivable from oracle totaled million and less than million  respectively 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of silicon wafers purchased from our foundry supplier  costs associated with the assembly  packaging and production testing of our ics  outside processing costs associated with the manufacture of our adapter cards  and switch systems  purchased cable costs  royalties due to third parties  warranty costs  excess and obsolete inventory costs  depreciation and amortization  and costs of personnel associated with production management  quality assurance and services 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from our foundries  we also face yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into semiconductor devices 
manufacturing yield is the percentage of acceptable product resulting from the manufacturing process  as identified when the product is tested as a finished ic 
if our manufacturing yields decrease  our cost per unit increases  which could have a significant adverse impact on our cost of revenues 
we do not have long term pricing agreements with foundry suppliers and contract manufacturers 
accordingly  our costs are subject to price fluctuations based on the overall cyclical demand for semiconductors 
we purchase our inventory pursuant to standard purchase orders 
we estimate that lead times for delivery of our finished semiconductors from our foundry supplier and assembly  packaging and production testing subcontractor are approximately three to four months  lead times for delivery from our adapter card manufacturing subcontractor are approximately eight to ten weeks  and lead times for delivery from our switch systems manufacturing subcontractors are approximately twelve weeks 
we build inventory based on forecasts of customer orders rather than the actual orders themselves 
in addition  our customers are seeking opportunities to minimize their inventory on hand while demanding 
table of contents shorter lead times for orders placed 
as a result  we have increased our inventory levels over the past year to meet this demand 
we expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of sales to increase in the future as a result of a reduction in the average sale price of our products and a higher percentage of revenue deriving from sales of switch systems and cables  which generally yield lower gross margins 
this trend will depend on overall customer demand for our products  our product mix  competitive product offerings and related pricing and our ability to reduce manufacturing costs 
operational expenses research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation and associated costs for employees engaged in research and development  costs associated with computer aided design software tools  depreciation  allocable facilities related and administrative expenses and tape out costs 
tape out costs are expenses related to the manufacture of new ics  including charges for mask sets  prototype wafers  mask set revisions and testing incurred before releasing new ics into production 
we anticipate these expenses will increase in future periods based on an increase in personnel to support our product development activities and the introduction of new products 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses may fluctuate over the course of a year based on the timing of our product tape outs 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  incentive compensation  share based compensation and associated costs for employees engaged in sales  marketing and customer support  commission payments to third party sales representatives  advertising  and charges for trade shows  promotions  travel and allocable facilities related and administrative expenses 
we expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in sales and marketing personnel and increased marketing activities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation and associated costs for employees engaged in finance  legal  human resources and administrative activities  professional service expenses for accounting  corporate legal fees and allocable facilities related expenses 
we expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in personnel and professional services required to support our business activities 
taxes on income our operations in israel have been granted approved enterprise status by the investment center of the israeli ministry of industry  trade and labor and beneficiary enterprise status by the israeli income tax authority  which makes us eligible for tax benefits under the israeli law for encouragement of capital investments  under the terms of the beneficiary enterprise program  income that is attributable to our operations in yokneam  israel will be exempt from income tax for a period of ten years commencing when we first generate taxable income after setting off our losses from prior years 
income that is attributable to our operations in tel aviv  israel will be exempt from income tax for a period of two years commencing when we first generate taxable income and will be subject to a reduced income tax rate generally to  depending on the percentage of foreign investment in the company for the following five to eight years 
the beneficiary enterprise tax holiday associated with our yokneam and tel aviv operations began in the yokneam tax holiday is expected to expire in and the tel aviv tax holiday is expected to expire between and in accordance with recent amendments to the israeli tax laws  as of january   the corporate income tax rate was increased to in 
table of contents in the first quarter of  we realigned some of our business activities and  as a result  may start utilizing carryforward net operating losses in one of our subsidiaries in the future 
the valuation allowance established for deferred tax assets will be released if it becomes more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in that subsidiary 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  fair value of financial instruments  inventory valuation  valuation and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles  warranty provision  share based compensation  contingent liabilities  and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
for further information on all of our significant accounting policies  please see note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sales of products when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
our standard arrangement with our customers typically includes freight on board shipping point  no right of return and no customer acceptance provisions 
the customer obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of shipment and are not dependent on the subsequent resale of the product 
we determine whether collectibility is probable on a customer by customer basis 
when assessing the probability of collection  we consider the number of years the customer has been in business and the history of our collections 
customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial positions and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable  no product is shipped and no revenue is recognized unless cash is received in advance 
we maintain inventory  or hub arrangements with certain customers 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports it and has removed our product from the warehouse to be incorporated into its end products 
multiple element arrangements excluding software for revenue arrangements that contain multiple deliverables  judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units 
moreover  judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met for each deliverable in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period 
while changes in the allocation of the arrangement consideration between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement  any material changes in these allocations 
table of contents could impact the timing of revenue recognition  which could affect our results of operations 
when we enter into an arrangement that includes multiple elements  the allocation of value to each element is derived based on management best estimate of selling price when vendor specific evidence or third party evidence is unavailable 
multiple element arrangements including software for multiple element arrangements that include a combination of hardware  software and services  such as post contract customer support  the arrangement consideration is first allocated among the accounting units before revenue recognition criteria are applied 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their fair value 
the fair value for undelivered software elements is based on vendor specific evidence 
if the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  no revenue is recognized 
the revenue from fixed price support or maintenance contracts  including extended warranty contracts and software post contract customer support agreements are recognized ratably over the contract period and the costs associated with these contracts are recognized as incurred 
distributor revenue a portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
we recognize revenue from these distributors based on the sell through method using inventory and point of sale information provided by the distributor 
additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
we classify the costs of these programs based on the identifiable benefit received as either a reduction of revenue  a cost of revenues or an operating expense 
deferred revenue and income we defer revenue and income when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and or services have been performed 
deferred revenue does not include amounts from products delivered to distributors that the distributors have not yet sold through to their end customers 
shipping and handling costs incurred for shipping and handling expenses to customers are recorded as cost of revenues 
to the extent these amounts are billed to the customer in a sales transaction  we record the shipping and handling fees as revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts 
if we determine that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  we provide a specific allowance for credit losses to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis and our historical experience with each customer 
customers are subject to an ongoing credit review process that evaluates their respective financial positions 
we review and update our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately million at december  and our bad debt expense totaled approximately less than million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and forward contracts 
we believe that the carrying amounts of the financial instruments approximate their respective fair values 
when there is no readily available market data  we may make fair value estimates  which may not necessarily represent the amounts that could be realized in a current or future sale of these assets 
short term investments we classify short term investment as available for sale securities 
we view our available for sale portfolio as available for use in current operations 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and we record temporary unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we charge unrealized losses against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  the extent to which fair value is less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on net realizable value 
cost is determined for raw materials on a first in  first out basis  for work in process based on actual costs and for finished goods based on standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based on market conditions and forecasted demand generally over a six to twelve months period 
inventory reserves are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until it is either sold or scrapped 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
we conduct a goodwill impairment qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment qualitative assessment requires us to perform an assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the business is less than its carrying amount 
the qualitative assessment considers various factors  including the macroeconomic environment  industry and market specific conditions  market capitalization  stock price  financial performance  earnings multiples  budgeted to actual revenue performance from the prior year  gross margin and cash flow from operating activities and issues or events specific to the business 
if adverse qualitative trends are identified that could negatively impact the fair value of the business  we perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
the step one goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of its business and certain assets and liabilities 
step two of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists in step one and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  an impairment exists and is recorded 
as of december   our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that goodwill in the reporting unit was not impaired 
intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology  customer relationships and in process research and development  or ipr d 
we amortize the intangible assets over their useful lives using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used or  if that pattern cannot be reliably 
table of contents determined  using a straight line amortization method 
we capitalize ipr d projects acquired as part of a business combination 
on completion of each project  ipr d assets are reclassified to developed technology and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
if any of the ipr d projects are abandoned  we would be required to impair the related ipr d asset 
intangible assets are tested for impairment when indicators of impairment exist 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired and whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
the qualitative assessment considers various factors  including reductions in demand  the abandonment of ipr d projects or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry and macroeconomic environment 
if adverse qualitative trends are identified that could negatively impact the fair value of the asset then quantitative impairment tests are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing an appropriate discount rate 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
as of december   our assessment of intangibles indicated that intangible assets were not impaired 
investment in privately held company as of december   we held a million investment in a privately held company 
we account for this investment under the cost method  reduced by any impairment write downs because we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the company 
to determine if the investment is recoverable  we monitor the investment and if facts and circumstances indicate that the investment may be impaired  then we conduct an impairment test of its investment 
to determine if the investment is recoverable  we review the privately held company revenue and earnings trends relative to pre defined milestones and overall business prospects  the general market conditions in its industry and other factors related to its ability to remain in business  such as liquidity and receipt of additional funding 
warranty provision we provide a limited warranty for periods of up to three years from the date of delivery against defects in materials and workmanship 
if a customer has a defective product  we will either repair the goods or provide replacement products at no charge 
we record estimated warranty expenses at the time we recognize the associated product revenues based on our historical rates of return and costs of repair over the preceding month period 
in addition  we recognize estimated warranty expenses for specific defects that are expected to result in warranty claims in excess of our historical rates of return at the time those defects are identified 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the share option awards as of the grant dates 
we estimate the fair value of share option awards using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected share price volatility  the calculation of expected term  and the fair value of the underlying ordinary share on the date of grant  among other inputs 
share compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over each recipient requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we base our estimate of expected volatility on a combination of our historical volatility and reported market value data for a group of publicly traded companies  which were selected from market indices that we believe would be indicators of our future share price volatility  after consideration of 
table of contents their size  stage of life cycle  profitability  growth  risk and return on investment 
we calculate the expected term of our options using the simplified method as prescribed by the authoritative guidance 
the expected term for newly granted options is approximately years 
share based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and this estimate is revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from that estimated  adjustments may be required to share based compensation expense in future periods 
in  we began granting restricted share units rsus to employees and non employee members of the board of directors 
the fair value of rsus is based on the closing market price of our ordinary shares on the date of grant 
share compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over each recipient requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
income taxes to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  tax planning strategies or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses  the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region  the availability of tax credits and carryforwards  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with the guidance on judgments regarding the realizability of deferred taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes

table of contents expenses such as share based compensation expense and the accrual of unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations over the next twelve months after taking into account expected increases in research and development expenses  including tape out costs  higher sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures to support our infrastructure and growth  and potential acquisitions

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years beyond years in thousands commitments under capital lease non cancelable operating lease commitments purchase commitments total for purposes of this table  purchase commitments are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
in addition  we have purchase orders that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the contractual obligation table excludes our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of cash payments 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million  which would reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate  if recognized 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report  for a full description of recent accounting standards  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our condensed consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of currency exchange rates exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is the new israeli shekel  or nis 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
in fiscal year  we used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of operating expenses denominated in nis 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income  net or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses in the same period in which the hedged operating expenses are recognized 
see note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuation risk we do not have any long term borrowings 
our investments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term deposits  money market funds and interest bearing investments in us government debt securities  foreign government bonds  commercial paper and corporate bonds with an average maturity of approximately one year 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
by policy  we limit the amount of our credit exposure through diversification and restricting our investments to highly rated securities 
at the time of purchase  we do not invest more than million in individual securities  except us treasury or agency securities 
highly rated securities are defined as having a minimum moody or standard poor rating of a or a  respectively 
we have not experienced any significant losses on our cash equivalents or short term investments 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we derive all of our revenues in us dollars 
the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency in all of our foreign locations 
however  a significant portion of our headcount related expenses  consisting principally of salaries and related personnel and facilities expenses  are denominated in new israeli shekels  or nis 
this foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the us dollar against the nis 
furthermore  we anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in nis 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against the nis  we will experience a negative impact on our profit margins 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we have established a balance sheet and anticipated transaction risk management program 
currency forward contracts and natural hedges are generally utilized in this hedging program 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
our hedging program reduces  but does not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements see part i  item a  risk factors 
if we were to experience a change in currency exchange rates  the impact on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions  would result in a loss before taxes of less than million at december  there would also be an impact on future operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
at december   approximately million of our monthly operating expenses were denominated in nis 
as of december   we had forward contracts in place that hedged future operating expenses of approximately million nis  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate as of december  the forward contracts cover a portion of our future nis denominated operating expenses expected to occur over the next twelve months 
our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement 
we seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across a number of major financial institutions 
however  under current market conditions  failure of one or more of these financial institutions is possible and could result in incurred losses 

table of contents inflation related risk we believe that the rate of inflation in israel has not had a material impact on our business to date 
our cost in israel in us dollar terms will increase if inflation in israel exceeds the devaluation of the nis against the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind inflation in israel
