item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data  and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
the information in this section has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements  which appear beginning on page of this annual report on form k 
you should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding the company provided in this annual report on form k 
overview our results of operations depend mainly on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense paid on our deposits and borrowed funds 
results of operations are also affected by fee income from deposits  lending and mortgage banking operations  provisions for loan losses  gains losses on sales and other than temporary impairment charges of loans and securities and other miscellaneous income 
our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  data processing  advertising  bank examination fees  amortization of intangibles  collection and other real estate owned  fdic insurance and income tax expense benefit 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly with respect to changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
see item a risk factors 
business strategy our business strategy is intended to increase profitability by increasing commercial real estate and commercial business lending 
in order to increase the yield of and reduce the term to repricing of our loan portfolio  we have increased our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios while maintaining the practice of sound credit decisions 
our commercial real estate and commercial business loan portfolios have grown from million and million at december   respectively to million and million at december   respectively 
at december   non performing commercial real estate and commercial business loans totaled million 
maintaining the quality of our loan portfolio 
maintaining the quality of our loan portfolio is a key factor in managing our operations  particularly during a period of economic weakness 
we will continue to use customary risk management techniques  such as independent internal and external loan reviews  portfolio credit analysis and field inspections of collateral in overseeing the performance of our loan portfolio 
our asset quality remains better than many indiana banks and thrifts with a nonperforming loans to total loans ratio of at december  and a nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of at december  continuing moderate growth in mortgage warehouse lending 
in order to increase the yield of our loan portfolio and increase noninterest income  during we introduced the mortgage warehouse line of business 
our mortgage warehouse lending business has grown from million originations in to billion in originations in we intend to moderately increase the activity in this division in future years 
increasing revenue with our mortgage banking strategy 
due to the low interest rate environment that has persisted since and is expected to continue for the near term  we have made the strategic decision in order to increase fee income and protect against interest rate risk  to sell virtually all of our fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans that we originate into the secondary market 

table of contents maintaining our status as an independent community oriented institution 
we intend to use our customer service and our knowledge of our local community to enhance our status as an independent community financial institution 
having employees who understand and value our clientele and their business is a key component to our success 
we believe that our present staff is one of our competitive strengths and thus the retention of such persons and our ability to continue to attract quality personnel is a high priority 
managed growth 
we intend to use our capital to grow organically and we may use a portion of the net proceeds of the second step conversion and offering to pursue future acquisitions of commercial banks  savings institutions  financial services companies and branch offices of such institutions if we find the right opportunity 
we have no current arrangements or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
managing interest rate risk 
we believe that it is difficult to achieve satisfactory levels of profitability in the financial services industry without assuming some level of interest rate risk 
however  we believe that such risk must be carefully managed to avoid undue exposure to changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we seek to manage to the extent practical our interest rate risk  which may include the use of interest rate swap agreements as a part of our strategy 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income  to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies securities 
declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are other than temporary are reflected as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary losses  management considers the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost and further review will be performed for all securities that have been in a loss position for greater than one year and at a current loss of or more  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and whether it has the ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt security  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and our intent not to sell the debt security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
management reviews a performance report issued by a third party on each of its mortgage backed securities on a quarterly basis 
this review includes information on each security  including the overall credit score and loan to value ratios for the underlying mortgage of these securities 
management completes a quarterly review of its corporate bond portfolio 
the third party review report includes each bond s investment grade 
we continue to closely monitor the corporate bonds due to ongoing economic concerns and spreads on these securities 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 

table of contents a loan is impaired with specific allowance amounts allocated  if applicable  when based on current information and events it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
loans for which the terms have been modified and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired 
loans included for analysis for potential impairment are all commercial and commercial real estate loans classified by us as substandard  doubtful or loss 
such loans are analyzed to determine if specific allowance allocations are required under either the fair value of collateral method  for all collateral dependent loans  or using the present value of estimated future cash flows method  using the loan s existing interest rate as the discount factor 
other factors considered in the potential specific allowance allocation measurement are the timing and reliability of collateral appraisals or other collateral valuation sources  the confidence in our lien on the collateral  historical losses on similar loans  and any other factors known to management at the time of the measurement that may affect the valuation 
based on management s consideration of these factors for each individual loan that is reviewed for potential impairment  a specific allowance allocation is assigned to the loan  if applicable  and such allocations are periodically monitored and adjusted as appropriate 
non specific general allowance amounts are allocated to all other loans not considered in the specific allowance allocation analysis described above 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as consumer and residential real estate loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment  and accordingly they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures 
a minimum and maximum allowance allocation estimate is determined for each general loan category or loan pool based on the current three year historical average annual loss ratios as well as consideration of significant recent changes in annual historical loss ratios  classified loan trends by category  delinquency ratios and inherent risk factors attributable to current local and national economic conditions 
all of the allowance for loan losses is allocated under the specific and general allowance allocation methodologies described above 
management reviews its allowance allocation estimates and loan collateral values on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts the allowance for loan losses for changes in specific and general allowance allocations  as appropriate 
any differences between the estimated and actual observed loan losses are adjusted through increases or decreases to the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis and such losses are then factored into the revised historical average annual loss ratios for future quarterly allowance allocations 
the laporte savings bank is subject to periodic examinations by its federal and state regulatory examiners and may be required by such regulators to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their assessment of credit information available to them at the time of their examinations 
the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is necessarily subjective 
in times of economic weakness  it is reasonably possible that future credit losses may exceed historical loss levels and may also exceed management s current estimates of incurred credit losses inherent within the loan portfolio 
as such  there can be no assurance that future charge offs will not exceed management s current estimate of what constitutes a reasonable allowance for loan losses 
the company acquired a group of loans through the acquisition of city savings financial corporation on october  purchased loans that showed evidence of credit deterioration since their origination were recorded at an allocated fair value  such that there is no carryover of the seller s specific allowance for loan losses for those loans 
after acquisition  incurred losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
for further information about the accounting treatment of purchased loans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents income taxes 
income tax expense benefit is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
the company recognizes interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the carrying value of our goodwill at least annually in order to determine if this intangible asset is impaired 
in reviewing the carrying value of our goodwill  we assess the recoverability of such assets by evaluating the fair value of the related business unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the excess and the carrying value of goodwill is reduced accordingly 
any impairment would be required to be recorded during the period identified 
at december   the company had core deposit intangibles of  subject to amortization and million of goodwill  which is not subject to amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible assets arising from the acquisition of city savings financial in accounting standards require an annual evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment using various estimates and assumptions 
the company s common stock at the close of business on december  was per common share  compared to a book value of per common share 
management believes the lower market price in relation to book value of the company s common stock is due to the overall decline in the financial industry sector and is not specific to the company 
further  the company engaged an independent expert in valuations to perform an impairment test of its goodwill 
the impairment test was performed in february as of october  and resulted in an implied fair value for the company sufficiently above the book value of its common stock to support the carrying value of goodwill 
as the company s stock price per common share is currently less than its book value per common share  it is reasonably possible that management may conclude that goodwill  totaling million at december   is impaired as a result of a future assessment 
if our goodwill is determined to be impaired  the related charge to earnings could be material 
other intangible assets consist of core deposit and acquired customer relationship intangible assets arising from a whole bank acquisition 
they are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives  which range from four to years 
these intangible assets are also periodically evaluated for impairment 
in the future  if these other intangible assets are determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially impacted 
the acquired customer relationship intangible asset was fully amortized by the end of 
table of contents average balance sheet the following table sets forth average balance sheets  average yields and costs  and certain other information for the years indicated

the company experienced an increase in total deposits in of million  or  which assisted in funding the increase in loans 
we continue to see a shift in our deposit composition when comparing balances at december  to december   with a reduction in time deposits and an increase in interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand  savings and money market accounts 
we attribute this change primarily to the continued low interest rate environment along with our strategic approach to pricing deposits and overall interest rate management 
federal home loan bank of indianapolis fhlbi advances decreased million  or  to million at december   as we were able to replace a significant portion of matured borrowings with the increase in lower cost deposits 
total shareholders equity increased million in primarily due to the net proceeds received in company s conversion and reorganization to a full stock holding company on october  
table of contents investment securities and interest earning time deposits total securities available for sale decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  due to payoffs 
during the same time period  interest earning time deposits at other financial institutions increased to million at december  interest earning time deposits were utilized as a short term investment alternative given the low interest rate environment 
at december   management reviewed the securities portfolio for possible other than temporary impairment and determined there were no impairment charges to be recorded 
the total available for sale securities portfolio reflected a net unrealized gain of million at december  compared to a net unrealized gain of million at december  loans held for sale loans held for sale decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  primarily due to the timing of when residential mortgage loans are originated and subsequently sold to the secondary market 
net loans net loans increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in mortgage warehouse and commercial business loans during during  we continued to experience strong demand for refinancing loans  particularly in the mortgage warehouse division throughout the country 
mortgage warehouse loans increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  the volume of such loans originated by the mortgage companies increased to billion in from billion in the home affordable refinance program  along with historically low long term mortgage interest rates during have contributed to continued increased demand in refinancing residential mortgage loans 
commercial business loans increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due to the origination of a million commercial loan to a customer in the health care and social assistance industry which was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at december  there was no material change in commercial real estate  construction  land or home equity loans at december  when compared to december  one to four family residential loans continued to decrease during from million at december  to million at december   or 
the decrease in this portfolio was primarily attributable to continued refinance activity and normal amortization of the seasoned loan portfolio during we have continued to sell the majority of our fixed rate one to four family residential loans originated 
management expects to continue selling the majority of the long term fixed rate one to four family residential loans originated in the near future to reduce interest rate risk exposure of fixed rate long term mortgages remaining on the balance sheet 
five or more family residential loans decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  during the first quarter of  a million loan secured by a residential apartment complex was paid off 
consumer loan demand continued to remain low during consistent with overall consumer spending patterns 
automobile and other loans decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  indirect automobile loans decreased million during primarily due to the competitive interest rates offered through automobile dealers on indirect loans as well as overall lack of consumer demand 
the allowance for loan losses balance increased  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  primarily due to a provision for loan losses of million offset by net charge offs of  during net charge offs of  had been specifically reserved for in prior periods 
the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was at december  compared to at december  
table of contents total nonperforming loans were million at december  up from million at december  total nonperforming loans to total loans ratio was at december  compared to at december  attributable to the increase in total nonperforming loans in addition to the increase in total loans over the same year 
the increase in nonperforming loans was due to the addition of four relationships totaling million which moved to nonaccrual status during the first relationship totaled  at december  and was secured by a strip mall in porter county 
this relationship also includes an office building located in porter county  indiana which was moved to other real estate owned during the fourth quarter of the company has an agreement to sell both of these properties with an expected closing during the second quarter of management does not anticipate any additional losses as a result of this transaction 
the second relationship totaled  at december  and is secured by a restaurant located in lake county  indiana 
during the fourth quarter of  this relationship was restructured into an a b note structure and is classified as a troubled debt restructuring 
the a note totaled  at december  and will remain in nonaccrual status for at least six months before management considers moving this note back to accrual status 
the b note totaled  and was immediately charged off at the time of restructuring 
the third relationship totaled  at december  and is secured by a hotel located in laporte county  indiana 
the company holds the first lien on this property with the united states small business administration holding a second lien on the property 
the final relationship totaled  at december  and is secured by several non owner occupied rental properties and a residential property in laporte county  indiana 
as of december   nonaccrual loans to rental  real estate and land developers totaled million  to accommodation and food services totaled million  to entertainment and recreation businesses totaled  to construction businesses totaled  and to all other commercial industry types totaled  one to four family residential loans on nonaccrual totaled million as of december  all other consumer loans on nonaccrual status totaled  at december  total nonperforming assets to total assets ratio increased to at december  compared to at december  primarily due to the increase in nonperforming loans mentioned above which was offset by a decrease of  in other real estate owned 
six properties were sold during with a recorded fair value of  and new properties were transferred into other real estate owned during the same year with a fair value of  for the year ended december   write downs totaling  were recorded on other real estate owned properties 
the current balance in other real estate owned includes the current market value of a property the company acquired in its acquisition of city savings bank in  which was held for future branch development 
the current market value of this property was  at december  the company anticipates listing this property for sale in the future but does not anticipate that to occur in the near future 
goodwill and other intangible assets our goodwill totaled million at december  and accounting standards require goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value  which is determined through a two step impairment test 
step includes the determination of the carrying value of the reporting unit  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we are required to perform a second step to the impairment test 
the most recent annual impairment review of the million of goodwill previously recorded was performed in february as of october  based on this evaluation completed in february  management determined that the fair value of the reporting unit  which is defined as laporte bancorp  inc as a whole  exceeded the book value of the goodwill  based on the opinion of an independent expert in valuations  such that the sales price per common share would exceed our book value per common share 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in as the company s market price per common share is currently less than its tangible book value per common share  it is reasonably possible that management may conclude that goodwill  totaling million at december   is impaired as a result of a future assessment 
if our goodwill is determined to be impaired  the related charge to earnings could be material 
deposits total deposits increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to an increase in both interest and noninterest bearing deposits 
the continued decline in interest rates offered on longer term certificates of deposit along with the addition of several commercial and personal estate deposit accounts has resulted in an increase in our transaction deposits and a decrease in our fixed rate longer term certificates of deposit 

table of contents noninterest bearing demand deposits increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in commercial lending relationships and their associated deposit accounts along with an increase in personal estate accounts during savings and money market accounts increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  interest bearing checking accounts increased million  or  to million at december  certificates of deposit and ira balances decreased million  or  to million at december   primarily due to the continued low interest rate environment 
non brokered certificates of deposit and ira time deposits decreased million during  primarily due to the continued competitive and low interest rate environment 
although management believes the interest rates offered on certificates of deposit have remained competitive  we have positioned them at or below the average rates offered in the market due to the pricing on alternative sources of funding 
partially offsetting this decrease in non brokered certificates of deposit and ira time deposits was an increase of million in brokered deposits during during the first quarter of  we purchased million of brokered deposits through cdars to replace the repayment of a portion of higher costing fhlbi advances and the fdic guaranteed unsecured borrowing which matured 
offsetting this increase in cdars deposits was a decrease in other brokered deposits of million during borrowed funds total borrowed funds decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december   as we were able to replace a significant portion of matured borrowings with the increase in lower cost deposits 
during  million in long term fhlbi advances matured and a portion of these advances were replaced by the purchase of million in cdars deposits  as well as by an increase in total deposits of million 
during the first quarter of  the million fdic guaranteed unsecured borrowing which the laporte savings bank entered into in matured and was paid off

in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loan loss experience  the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events occur 
after an evaluation of these factors  management recognized a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year

liquidity and capital resources we maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet both our short and long term liquidity needs 
we adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows  repay our borrowings and to fund loan commitments 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives 
liquidity levels fluctuate significantly based upon the demand in the mortgage warehouse lending division 
our primary sources of liquidity are deposits  amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations  as well as access to federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and rates offered by our competition 
we set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits 

table of contents a portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings  which are a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
at december  and december   million and million of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents  respectively

off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit 
for information about our loan commitments  letters of credit and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein regarding the company have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  because such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk our asset liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  our primary source of earnings 
historically  we have relied on funding longer term higher interest earning assets with shorter term lower interest bearing deposits to earn a favorable net interest rate spread 
as a result  we have been vulnerable to adverse changes in interest rates 
over the past several years  management has implemented an asset liability strategy to manage  subject to our profitability goals  our interest rate risk 
among the techniques we are currently using to manage interest rate risk are i expanding  subject to market conditions  our commercial real estate loans  commercial business loans and mortgage warehouse loans as they generally reprice more quickly than residential mortgage loans  ii selling on the secondary market most of our originations of long term fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans  iii subject to market conditions and consumer demand  originating residential adjustable rate mortgages for our portfolio  iv using interest rate swaps  caps or floors to hedge our assets and or liabilities  and v reducing the amount of long term  fixed rate mortgage backed and cmo securities  which are vulnerable to an increasing interest rate environment and will extend in duration 
we have also used structured rates with redemption features to improve our yield and may consider interest rate swaps and other hedging instruments although we have not done so recently 
while this strategy has helped manage our interest rate exposure  it does pose risks 
for instance  the prepayment options embedded in adjustable rate one to four family residential loans and the mortgage backed securities and cmos  which allow for early repayment at the borrower s discretion may result in prepayment before the loan reaches the fully indexed rate 
conversely  in a falling interest rate environment  borrowers may refinance their loans and redeemable securities may be called 
in addition  non residential lending generally presents higher credit risks than residential one to four family lending 
our board of directors is responsible for the review and oversight of management s asset liability strategies 
our asset liability committee is charged with developing and implementing an asset liability management plan 
this committee meets monthly to review pricing and liquidity needs and assess our interest rate risk 
we currently utilize a third party modeling program  prepared on a quarterly basis  to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates 
in addition  on a monthly basis  the committee reviews our current liquidity position  investment activity  deposit and loan repricing and terms  interest rate swap effectiveness testing  and federal home loan bank and other borrowing strategies 
depending on market conditions  we often place more emphasis on enhancing net interest margin rather than matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
in particular  we believe that the increased net interest income resulting from a mismatch in the maturity of our asset and liabilities portfolios can  during periods of stable interest rates  provide high enough returns to justify increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates 
as a result of this philosophy  our results of operations will remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates 

table of contents quantitative analysis 
the table below sets forth  as of december   the estimated changes in the net interest margin and the economic value of equity that would result from the designated changes in the united states treasury yield curve over a month non parallel ramp for the laporte savings bank 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
estimated increase decrease in nim estimated increase decrease in eve eve as percentage of economic value of assets changes in interest rates basis points estimated nim amount percent estimated eve amount percent eve ratio changes in basis points dollars in thousands assumes changes in interest rates over a month non parallel ramp 
nim or net interest margin measures the laporte savings bank s exposure to net interest income due to changes in a forecast interest rate environment 
eve or economic value of equity at risk measures the laporte savings bank s exposure to equity due to changes in a forecast interest rate environment 
eve ratio represents economic value of equity divided by the economic value of assets which should translate into built in stability for future earnings 
the table above indicates that at december   in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates over a month non parallel ramp  we would experience a decrease in net interest margin 
in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates over a month non parallel ramp  the net interest margin would increase 
the table above indicates that at december   in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates over a month non parallel ramp  we would experience a decrease in economic value of equity 
in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates over a month non parallel ramp  the economic value would increase in economic value of equity 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in the economic portfolio value of equity and net interest margin require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in interest rates 
in this regard  the table above assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that particular changes in interest rates occur at different times and in different amounts in response to a designed change in the yield curve for us treasuries 
furthermore  although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income 
finally  the above table does not take into account the changes in the credit risk of our assets which can occur in connection with changes in interest rates 

table of contents the company is also continuing to take steps to address its exposure to rising interest rates 
for instance management executed an interest rate swap to address the exposure on its million floating rate trust preferred debenture in april  by swapping for a fixed five year effective rate of 
in october  the company executed a million interest rate swap which took million five year floating rate brokered certificates of deposit and swapped for a fixed five year effective rate of 
in february  the laporte savings bank executed two interest rate swaps against million in maturing fhlb advances 
the first interest rate swap was against a million adjustable rate advance tied to the three month libor plus for six years at an effective fixed rate of and began in july the second interest rate swap was against a million adjustable rate advance tied to the three month libor plus for five years with an effective fixed rate of and began in september we will continue to look for opportunities to address our exposure to rising interest rates utilizing hedging strategies in the future 
we are also continuing to sell most of the fixed rate one to four family residential real estate loans originated and continuing to originate the majority of commercial real estate loans at a variable rate with interest rate floors attached
