item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies beginning on page we have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth 
our total assets include substantial goodwill 
at december   our goodwill totaled million 
the goodwill results from our prior acquisitions  representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired 
we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant 
if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines  we may be required to reflect a non cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment 
the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization  the effect of which could be material 
see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies beginning on page we could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates 
at december   we and our subsidiaries had approximately million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding  of which approximately had interest rates that float with the market 
a basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at december  would have resulted in an approximate million annualized increase in interest expense 
we may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders 
at december   we had million of order backlog  the majority of which related to aerospace oem customers 
there can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
we consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery 
from time to time  oem customers of aerospace and industrial provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs 
such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm order from our customers 
our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate  reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog 
if our customers terminate  reduce or defer firm orders  we may be protected from certain costs and losses  but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected 
although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers  there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets 
also  our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties  including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time  or at all  the number of units that our customers actually produce  the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers 
in addition  until firm orders are placed  our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty 
our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not recover all of our up front costs related to new or existing programs 
new programs require significant up front investments for capital equipment  engineering  inventory  design and tooling 
as oems in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design  engineering and manufacture of systems and components  they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well 
this trend is likely to continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement 
we cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing 
in the event that we are unable to make such investments  or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers  our profitability  liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected 
in addition  we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity 
while we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products  the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes 
if the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated  we may be unable to recover such costs 
in addition  because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed  declines in our customers production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up front investments are recovered 
we may not realize all of the intangible assets related to rsps 
our total investments in participation fees under our rsps as of december  equaled million  all of which have been paid 
at december   the remaining 
table of contents unamortized balance of these participation fees was million 
we participate in aftermarket rsps under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to a large aerospace manufacturer 
as consideration  we pay participation fees  which are recorded as long lived intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to years 
the realizability of each intangible asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the program s aftermarket parts and is subject to impairment testing whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions  including  for example  the replacement of older airplane engines with new  more fuel efficient engines 
a shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the total amount of the investments  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  future growth and profitability could be impacted by increasing management fees  amortization of the participation fees and the expiration of the singapore pioneer tax status incentives on these programs 
we face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed price contracts 
we sell certain of our products under firm  fixed price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us 
the cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor  materials  fuel  outside processing  overhead and other factors  including manufacturing inefficiencies 
increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts 
the departure of existing management and key personnel  a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business  operations and prospects 
our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business 
our future success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel 
although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise  our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
because of the complex nature of many of our products and services  we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce  including  for example  our engineering talent 
in addition  there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals 
we could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights  including patents  trademarks and trade secrets 
our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged  invalidated or infringed upon by third parties 
our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage  adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position  financial condition and results of operations 
any product liability  warranty  contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition 
our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design  manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers  or to potential warranty  contractual or other claims 
for example  we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury  property damage or death as a result of the failure of a spring or other part in a vehicle or an aircraft component designed  manufactured or sold by us  or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves  including potentially hazardous substances in a product purchased by us and sold by us to one of our customers 
while we have liability insurance for certain risks  our insurance may not cover all liabilities 
additionally  insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us 
any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
from time to time  we receive product warranty claims  under which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products 
warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field 
we vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters 
we cannot  however  assure you that the costs  charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material  or that those costs  charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages 
approximately of our us employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and more than of our non us employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements 
in  we are scheduled to negotiate national health care and pension collective bargaining agreements with unionized employees at our bristol  ct  corry  pa  and saline  mi locations  which collectively cover approximately employees 
in addition  we have annual negotiations in brazil and mexico and  collectively  these negotiations also cover approximately employees in 
table of contents those two countries 
we also expect to have negotiations in with two of our german locations  our singapore location  and our sweden location  which cover approximately   and employees  respectively 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are good  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor  including healthcare  pensions or other benefits 
any potential strikes or work stoppages  and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
similarly  a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers  suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business 
changes in accounting guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financial results 
new accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time  or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance  could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods 
in addition  our products are subject to import and excise duties and or sales or value added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate 
increases in indirect taxes could affect our products affordability and therefore reduce our sales 
we are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues 
changes in tax laws  tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate 
among other things  our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the repatriation of foreign earnings to the us we must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes  interest and penalties  accordingly  future events could change management s assessment of these amounts 
risks related to the industries in which we operate a general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial results 
all of our businesses are impacted by the health of the economies in which they operate 
a decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures  thereby having an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry 
the operation of our business within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in it  including unfavorable pricing pressures 
while the precise effects of instability in the transportation industry are difficult to determine  they may negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we operate in very competitive markets 
we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors  and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our three global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve 
some of our competitors have greater financial  production  research and development  or other resources than we do 
within aerospace  certain of our oem customers compete with our repair and overhaul business 
some of our oem customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen  for capacity limitations  cost considerations or other reasons  to outsource the manufacturing to us 
our three business segments compete on the basis of price  service  quality  reliability of supply  technology  innovation and design 
a majority of the products sold by distribution are not unique  and its competitors carry substantially similar products 
we must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position 
our competitors may develop products or services  or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products  services or methods 
our competitors may also adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors 
also  if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs  we expect the competitive pressures we face to increase 
our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our customers businesses are generally cyclical 
weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability 
the industries to which we sell tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production 
aerospace is heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry  which is cyclical and a long cycle industry 
industrial and distribution are dependent on the transportation industry  and general industrial and tooling markets  all of which are also cyclical 
many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns  which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products 
original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time 
additionally  we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers 
there is substantial and continuing pressure from oems in the transportation industries  including automotive and aerospace  to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers 
we attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure  while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers  by seeking to reduce our 
table of contents production costs through various measures  including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost effective process improvements 
our suppliers have periodically resisted  and in the future may resist  pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases 
if we are unable to offset oem price reductions  our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected 
in addition  oems have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms  including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount 
oems can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices  which could have a negative impact on our short term working capital 
demand for our defense related products depends on government spending 
a portion of aerospace sales are derived from the military market  including single sourced and dual sourced sales 
the military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations 
although multi year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements  funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years 
consequently  programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made 
we cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business 
moreover  we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full scale production as expected 
a decrease in levels of defense spending or the government s termination of  or failure to fully fund  one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and financial results 
the industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation 
there has been consolidation of both suppliers and the customers we serve 
supplier consolidation is in part attributable to oems more frequently awarding long term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased 
we cannot assure you that our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers 
the aerospace industry is highly regulated 
complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the company 
a substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses 
the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the us by the federal aviation administration  or faa  and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies 
we must be certified by these agencies and  in some cases  by individual oems in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models 
if material authorizations or approvals were delayed  revoked or suspended  our business could be adversely affected 
new or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted  or industry oversight heightened  in the future  and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight 
environmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations 
environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect  and we may be subject to material environmental based claims in the future 
our past and present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property and the use  sale  storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing us federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  as well as those of other countries  pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment  enforcement  disposition of wastes including hazardous wastes  the use  shipping  labeling  and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials  building requirements  or otherwise relating to protection of the environment 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes 
accordingly  we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business 
we may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated or which may have been contaminated prior to our purchase  and to claims alleging personal injury 
high jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results 
fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry 
widespread disruption to oil production  refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the us can increase the price of jet fuel significantly 
conflicts in the middle east  an important source of oil for the us and other countries where we do business  cause prices for fuel to be volatile and often significantly higher than historic levels 
because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry  increased fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the price of energy generally 
table of contents impacts the cost of operating our manufacturing and distribution operations 
we have experienced significant increases in energy costs  and energy costs could continue to rise  which would result in higher transportation  freight and other operating costs 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along energy costs to our customers through increased prices 
our products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products  technologies and processes 
our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time 
our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition  or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new  different technologies and processes 
additionally  we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction including the use of additional resources such as personnel 
risks related to restructuring  acquisitions  divestitures and joint ventures our acquisition and divestiture strategies and our restructuring activities may not be successful 
we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and we anticipate that we may  from time to time  acquire additional businesses  assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses 
a significant portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries 
as a result  our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations 
we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms  obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future 
we have also in the past divested assets and businesses 
we may in the future engage in discussions with potential acquirers of certain of our assets or businesses in order to meet our strategic objectives  but we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in finding suitable purchasers for any such desired sale of such assets or businesses 
we will need to integrate any acquired businesses with our existing operations 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies 
in connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies  we may periodically restructure our businesses and or sell assets or portions of our business 
integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties  significant expense and accounting charges  disrupt our business or divert management s time and attention 
acquisitions involve numerous other risks  including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business 
in connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the us  we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments  which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts 
additionally  our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates 
we cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant 
the acquisition of synventive exposes the company to a number of risks and uncertainties  the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations as well as the market price of our common stock 
such risks and uncertainties include risks relating to the integration of synventive business with the company  the financial performance of synventive and risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the synventive acquisition 
our ability to realize such benefits will depend on our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate synventive business  which involves products and services  markets and geographies that are new to the company  into our business  in addition to an increased scale of our international operations 
difficulties of integration could include coordinating and consolidating separate systems  integrating the management of the acquired business  retaining market acceptance of synventive products and services  maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees  and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines 
any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees  customers  business partners and suppliers 
in addition  even if integration is successful  the financial performance of the acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated revenue and earnings enhancements from the synventive acquisition 
in addition  our management has spent  and will continue to spend  a significant amount of its time and efforts directed toward the integration of synventive  which time and efforts otherwise could have been spent on our other businesses and other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us 
finally  we have incurred a substantial amount of additional indebtedness which could have an adverse effect on our financial health and make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the future 
the additional debt we incurred to fund the acquisition purchase price may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain 
table of contents any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  future acquisitions  debt service requirements or other purposes 
additionally  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to meet these additional debt obligations 
any default under the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of the repayment obligations to our lenders  as well as the acceleration of all of our outstanding debt 
the realization of any of the foregoing risks may materially adversely affect our business  cash flows  financial condition  results of operations or the market price of our common stock 
in accordance with applicable sec guidance  management report on internal control over financial reporting excludes the assessment of synventive 
we plan to fully evaluate the internal controls of synventive and any subsequently acquired companies  then implement a standardized framework of internal controls at those acquired businesses 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to synventive or any other acquisitions 
if we engage in a divestiture of assets or a business  we cannot be certain that our business  operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected 
a successful divestiture depends on various factors  including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities  contracts  facilities and employees to any purchaser  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business  and collect the proceeds from any divestitures 
in addition  if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners  this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction  our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
in addition  divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks  including the diversion of management and employee attention  significant costs and expenses  the loss of customer relationships  and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business 
furthermore  divestitures potentially involve significant post closing separation activities  which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources 
any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture  as well as significant write offs  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not achieve expected cost savings from restructuring activities and actual charges  costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates 
our ability to realize anticipated cost savings  synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors  including the following our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel  rationalize manufacturing capacity  synchronize information technology systems  consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities  significant cash and non cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings  which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures  and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts or divestitures 
any joint ventures or teaming arrangements we enter into may not be successful 
we may enter into joint ventures or teaming arrangements 
partners with whom we share control may at any time have economic  business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture or arrangement 
our joint venture or teaming arrangements may require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we may have little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments 
in addition  our joint venture or teaming partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone 
our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest or teaming arrangement to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions  joint ventures or teaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot assure you that any of our joint ventures or teaming arrangements will be profitable or that forecasts regarding joint venture or teaming activities will be accurate 
in particular  risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures and teaming arrangements include  among others  the joint venture s or teaming partner s ability to operate its business successfully  to develop appropriate standards  controls  procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture or teaming arrangement and the strength of the their relationships with employees  suppliers and customers

interest payments under long term debt obligations have been estimated based on the borrowings outstanding and market interest rates as of december  the amounts do not include purchase obligations reflected as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the purchase obligation amount includes all outstanding purchase orders as of the balance sheet date as well as the minimum contractual obligation or termination penalty under other contracts 
the amount included in less than year reflects anticipated contributions to the company s various pension plans 
anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable 
the amounts reflect anticipated future benefit payments under the company s various other postretirement benefit plans based on current actuarial assumptions 
expected benefit payments do not extend beyond see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of the potential payments of these amounts cannot be determined 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
other matters inflation inflation generally affects the company through its costs of labor  equipment and raw materials 
increases in the costs of these items have historically been offset by price increases  commodity price escalator provisions  operating improvements  and other cost saving initiatives 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on aerospace contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the company carries a certain amount of inventory which is industry specific including spare parts for the aerospace market 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  access to applicable markets  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 
business acquisitions and goodwill assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or earlier if an 
table of contents event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit may have been reduced below its carrying value 
management completes its annual impairment assessment during the second quarter of each year 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the company has determined that its reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information reviewed by segment management one level below the operating segment level and which are aggregated when those components have similar economic characteristics 
management estimates the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using the income approach  which reflects management s cash flow projections  and also evaluates the fair value using a market approach 
these methodologies used in the current year are consistent with those used in the prior year 
management believes the cash flow projections utilized and or market multiples are reasonable and consistent with the expectations of market participants 
inherent in management s development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates  including those related to future earnings and growth and the weighted average cost of capital 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods as a result of both company specific and overall economic conditions 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  industries and markets in which the company sells products or services  and the execution of management s plans 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
in the second quarter of  management performed its annual impairment testing based on the information available as of the date of the assessment 
based on this assessment  there was no goodwill impairment and the fair values of each of the company s reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 
the company determined during the fourth quarter of that the estimated fair value of its heinz h nggi reporting unit  which is part of the industrial segment and has approximately million of goodwill  decreased from the second quarter of due in part to declining economic conditions in europe 
the estimated fair value as a percentage of carrying value approximated  as such the fair value of the reporting unit did not significantly exceed its carrying value 
revenue and operating income growth assumptions and the risk adjusted discount rate  which represents the weighted average cost of capital  have the most significant influence on the estimation of the fair value at this reporting unit 
under the income approach  revenue and operating income growth rate assumptions were used to estimate cash flows in future periods 
growth rates were based on current levels of backlog  the retention of existing customers and the ability to attain new customers through new product introductions 
if operating profit growth assumptions for our heinz h nggi reporting unit decline by approximately per annum  the reporting unit may not pass step one and step two could result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge 
management utilized a discount rate of to estimate the present value of future cash flows 
the discount rate was based upon a build up of market data from similar companies and reflected uncertainty related to the company ability to achieve its forecasted results 
holding all other assumptions constant  an increase in the rate used to discount the expected future cash flows of approximately basis points would reduce the fair value such that the reporting unit would not pass step one  and step two could result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge 
the factors that affect the level of estimated cash flows within this reporting unit include  but are not limited to declines in our market share and customer demand assumptions based on our competition  our ability to successfully launch new product introductions  delays in orders placed by existing customers  the ongoing impacts of the european economic environment  including potential declines in pricing  reductions in volume or fluctuations in exchange rates within the regions served by heinz h nggi and increases to the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital 
management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests for all reporting units with goodwill 
while management expects future operating improvements to result from improving end market conditions  new product introductions and further market penetration  there can be no assurance that such expectations will be met or that the fair value of the reporting unit will continue to exceed its carrying value 
if its fair value were to fall below its carrying value  a non cash impairment charge to income from operations could result 
revenue sharing programs the company participates in aftermarket rsps under which the company receives an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program 
as consideration  the company has paid participation fees  which are recorded as long lived intangible assets  and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to years 
the carrying value of these intangible assets is million at december  the company records amortization of the related long lived intangible asset as sales dollars are being earned based on a proportional sales dollar method 
specifically  this method amortizes each intangible asset as a reduction to revenue based on the proportion of sales under a program in a given period to the estimated aggregate sales dollars over the life of that program 
this method reflects the pattern in which economic benefits are realized 
the recoverability of each intangible asset is subject to significant estimates about future revenues related to the program s aftermarket parts 
the company evaluates these intangible assets for impairment and updates amortization rates on 
table of contents an agreement by agreement basis 
the intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
annually  the company evaluates the remaining useful life of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
management updates revenue projections  which includes comparing actual experience against projected revenue and industry projections 
the potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions 
a shortfall in future revenues may indicate a triggering event requiring an impairment test of the intangible asset or require the company to accelerate amortization expense prospectively dependent on the level of the shortfall 
the company has not identified any impairment of these intangible assets 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies and significant assumptions related to pension and other postretirement benefits are disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the following table provides a breakout of the current targeted mix of investments  by asset classification  along with the historical rates of return for each asset class and the long term projected rates of return for the us plans 
target asset mix annual return historical long term projection asset class large cap growth large cap value mid cap equity small cap growth small cap value non us equity real estate related fixed income cash weighted average historical returns based on the life of the respective index  approximately years 
the historical rates of return were calculated based upon compounded average rates of return of published indices 
the aggregate target for fixed income and cash investments in aggregate is lower than the fixed income and cash component of a typical pension trust 
the fixed income investments include a higher than average component of yield aggressive investments  including high yield corporate bonds 
based on the overall historical and projected rates of return of the targeted asset mix  management is using the long term rate of return on its us pension assets of 
the long term rates of return for non us plans were selected based on actual historical rates of return of published indices that were used to measure the plans target asset allocations 
historical rates were then discounted to consider fluctuations in the historical rates as well as potential changes in the investment environment 
the discount rate used for the company s us pension plans reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
at december   the company selected a discount rate of based on a bond matching model for its us pension plans 
market interest rates have decreased in as compared with and  as a result  the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities decreased from at december  the discount rates for non us plans were selected based on bond matching models or on indices of high quality bonds using criteria applicable to the respective countries 
a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return on the company s us pension plans as of december  would impact the company s pre tax income by approximately million annually 
a one quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate on the company us pension plans as of december  would decrease the company s pre tax income by approximately million annually 
the company reviews these and other assumptions at least annually 
the company recorded a million non cash after tax decrease in stockholders equity through other non owner changes to equity to record the current year adjustment for changes in the funded status of its pension and postretirement benefit plans as required under accounting for defined benefit and other postretirement plans 
this decrease in stockholders 
table of contents equity resulted primarily from losses related to changes in actuarial assumptions  offset in part by favorable variances between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets 
during  the fair value of the company s pension plan assets increased by million and the projected benefit obligation increased million 
the change in the projected benefit obligation included a million pre tax increase due to actuarial losses that resulted primarily from the reduction to the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities 
changes to other actuarial assumptions in  including mortality and inflation rates  did not have a material impact on our stockholders equity or projected benefit obligation 
the performance of the pension plan assets improved in  partially offsetting the impact of the lower discount rate 
actual pre tax return on total pension plan assets was million compared with an expected pre tax return on pension assets of million 
approximately million and million of pension plan asset increases and projected benefit obligation increases  respectively  relate to the transfer of the defined benefit pension plan of the acquired synventive business 
pension expense for is expected to increase to approximately million  an increase of million from  primarily as a result of an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses from previous asset performance and changes in certain actuarial assumptions  primarily a lower discount rate 
the expense estimate does not include potential future settlement costs 
income taxes as of december   the company had recognized million of deferred tax assets  net of valuation reserves  principally in the united states 
the realization of these benefits is dependent in part on the amount and timing of future taxable income in the jurisdictions where deferred tax assets reside 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax loss carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
management believes that sufficient taxable income should be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets  net of valuation allowances recorded 
the united states deferred tax assets include significant tax operating loss carryforwards 
if it became more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would expire unused  the company would record a valuation allowance to reflect this fact 
the company is not in a cumulative loss position in the us over the last three years defined as pre tax book income plus permanent tax items and does not currently project to be in a cumulative loss position through the valuation of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
management s assessment that these deferred tax assets will be realized represents its estimate of future results  however  there can be no assurance that such expectations will be met 
changes in management s assessment of achieving sufficient future taxable income could materially increase the company s tax expense and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management plans to continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in the future 
additionally  the company is exposed to certain tax contingencies in the ordinary course of business and  accordingly  records those tax liabilities in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized 
for those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock based employee compensation plans at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the related cost in its consolidated statement of income in accordance with accounting standards related to share based payments 
the fair values of stock options are estimated using the black scholes option pricing model based on certain assumptions 
the fair values of service and performance based share awards are estimated based on the fair market value of the company s stock price on the grant date 
the fair value of market based performance share awards are estimated using the monte carlo valuation method 
see note of the consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the company s financial results could be impacted by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity price changes 
the company uses financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s long term debt portfolio consists of fixed rate and variable rate instruments and is managed to reduce the overall cost of borrowing while also minimizing the effect of changes in interest rates on near term earnings 
the company s primary interest rate risk is derived from its outstanding variable rate debt obligations 
financial instruments have been used by the company to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company previously had two  three year interest rate swap agreements which together converted the interest on the first million of the company one month libor based borrowings from a variable rate plus the borrowing spread to a fixed rate of plus the borrowing spread and were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
these agreements matured in the first quarter of in april  the company entered into five year interest rate swap agreements transacted with three banks which together convert the interest on the first million of borrowings under the company s credit agreement from a variable rate plus the borrowing spread to a fixed rate of plus the borrowing spread for the purpose of mitigating its exposure to variable interest rates 
at december   the result of a hypothetical basis point increase in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt would have reduced annual pretax profit by million 
at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt was million  compared with its carrying amount of million 
the company estimates that a basis point decrease in market interest rates at december  would have increased the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt to million 
the company has manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus makes investments and conducts business transactions denominated in various currencies 
the currencies of the locations where the company s business operations are conducted include the us dollar  brazilian real  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  euro  hong kong dollar  japanese yen  korean won  mexican peso  singapore dollar  swedish kroner  swiss franc and thai baht 
the company is exposed primarily to financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at its international locations 
a adverse change in all currencies at december  would have resulted in a million loss in the fair value of those financial instruments 
at december   the company held million of cash and cash equivalents and million million of restricted cash held in escrow  substantially all of which is held by foreign subsidiaries 
this includes cash proceeds from the sale of the bde business that was received in  the majority of which was not in the local functional currency 
the company maintained forward currency contracts at december  to reduce the foreign currency exposure related to the proceeds 
foreign currency commitments and transaction exposures are managed at the operating units as an integral part of their businesses in accordance with a corporate policy that addresses acceptable levels of foreign currency exposures 
at december   the company did not hedge its foreign currency net investment exposures 
additionally  to reduce foreign currency exposure  management generally maintains the majority of foreign cash and short term investments in functional currency and uses forward currency contracts for non functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and anticipated transactions in an effort to reduce the effect of the volatility of changes in foreign exchange rates on the income statement 
in historically weaker currency countries  such as brazil and mexico  management assesses the strength of these currencies relative to the us dollar and may elect during periods of local currency weakness to invest excess cash in us dollar denominated instruments 
the company s exposure to commodity price changes relates to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high grade steel spring wire  stainless steel  titanium and other specialty metals and the distribution operations which distribute products made of steel  copper and brass 
the company attempts to manage its exposure to price increases through its procurement and sales practices
