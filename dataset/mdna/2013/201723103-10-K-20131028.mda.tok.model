overview our business is organized into the following five segments americas recycling  americas mills  americas fabrication  international mill and international marketing and distribution 
americas recycling our americas recycling segment processes scrap metals for use as a raw material by manufacturers of new metal products 
this segment operates scrap metal processing facilities with locations in texas  seven in florida  two locations in missouri and one location in each of arkansas  georgia  kansas  louisiana  north carolina  oklahoma and tennessee 
americas mills our americas mills segment includes the company five steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills  that produce one or more of reinforcing bar  angles  flats  rounds  small beams  fence post sections and other shapes  two scrap metal shredders and nine processing facilities that directly support the steel minimills  and a railroad salvage company 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to sell our wholly owned copper tube manufacturing operation  howell metal company howell 
we determined that the decision to sell this business met the definition of a discontinued operation 
as a result  we have included howell in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
howell was previously an operating segment included in the americas mills reporting segment 
on october   we sold all of the stock of howell for million  subject to customary purchase price adjustments 
americas fabrication the americas fabrication segment consists of the company steel plants that bend  weld  cut and fabricate steel  primarily reinforcing bar  warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete  plants that produce steel fence posts  and plants that heat treat steel to strengthen and provide flexibility 
international mill our international mill segment is comprised of all mill  recycling and fabrication operations located in poland 
our subsidiary  cmc poland sp 
zoo cmcp formerly cmc zawiercie zoo or cmcz  owns a steel minimill and conducts its mill operations in zawiercie  poland 
this segment operations are conducted through two rolling minimills that produce primarily reinforcing bar and high quality merchant products  a specialty rod finishing mill  our scrap processing facilities that directly support the minimill  and four steel fabrication plants primarily for reinforcing bar and mesh 
international marketing and distribution our international marketing and distribution segment includes international operations for the sales  distribution and processing of steel products  ferrous and nonferrous metals and other industrial products 
additionally  this segment includes the company us based marketing and distribution divisions  cmc cometals and cmc cometals steel  and a recycling facility in singapore 
we buy and sell primary and secondary metals  fabricated metals  semi finished  long and flat steel products and other industrial products 
we market and distribute these products through our global network of offices  processing facilities and joint ventures 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations is based on our continuing operations and excludes any results of our discontinued operations 
consolidated results of operations year ended august  in thousands except per share data net sales earnings from continuing operations per diluted share adjusted ebitda international net sales as of total sales lifo income expense effect on net earnings loss attributable to cmc per diluted share excludes divisions classified as discontinued operations 
last in  first out inventory valuation method 
in the table above  we have included a financial statement measure that was not derived in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we use adjusted ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  impairment charges and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests as a non gaap financial measure 
in calculating adjusted ebitda  we exclude our largest recurring non cash charge  depreciation and amortization  as well as impairment charges 
adjusted ebitda provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal  state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
we also exclude interest cost in our calculation of adjusted ebitda 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
we use adjusted ebitda as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments  our ability to pay our current debt obligations as they mature and as a tool to calculate possible future levels of leverage capacity 
adjusted ebitda is also the target benchmark for our annual and long term cash incentive performance plans for management and part of a debt compliance test in certain of our debt agreements 
adjusted ebitda may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies 
reconciliations of net earnings from continuing operations to adjusted ebitda are provided below year ended august  in thousands earnings from continuing operations less net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests interest expense income taxes benefit depreciation  amortization and impairment charges adjusted ebitda our adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and impairment charges or net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenues 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
impairment charges  when necessary  accelerate the write off of fixed assets that otherwise would have been accomplished by periodic depreciation charges 
additionally  the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our operations 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is appropriate to consider both net earnings loss determined in accordance with gaap  as well as adjusted ebitda  to evaluate our performance 
further  we separately analyze any significant fluctuations in interest expense  depreciation  amortization  impairment charges and income taxes 
the following are the significant factors that impacted our financial performance during compared with our americas recycling segment was negatively impacted by declining ferrous and non ferrous volumes and margins  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
our americas fabrication segment showed the most progress when compared to the prior year  recording adjusted operating profit of million  compared with an adjusted operating loss of million in fiscal in our rebar and structural fabrication businesses  selling prices increased while raw material input prices for steel declined  enabling margin expansion for this segment 
our international mill segment recorded a significant decline in adjusted operating profit in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
the decline in profitability was primarily a result of lower shipments when compared to fiscal  as business conditions in the eurozone remain challenged 
we recorded impairments related to long lived assets of million 
of this amount  approximately million related to our australian operations  as market conditions in australia continued to show weakness in general and specifically in the steel construction market 
our year to date effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets related to our australian operations as well as lower earnings by our foreign subsidiaries 
pre tax lifo income was million  million more than lifo income of million in during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our ownership interest in trinecke zelezarny  as trinecke  a czech republic joint stock company  for million resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
this gain was recorded in our international marketing and distribution segment 
segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollar amounts below are calculated before income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for the purpose of making operating decisions 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we use adjusted operating profit loss to measure the financial performance of our segments 
adjusted operating profit loss is the sum of our earnings loss before income taxes and financing costs 
the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in thousands net sales americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication international mill international marketing and distribution corporate eliminations net sales adjusted operating profit loss americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication international mill international marketing and distribution corporate eliminations adjusted operating profit lifo impact on adjusted operating profit loss lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent inventory purchases or goods manufactured are sold first 
therefore  current sales prices are offset against current inventory costs 
in periods of rising prices  the lifo inventory costing method has the effect of eliminating inflationary profits from operations 
in periods of declining prices  this method has the effect of eliminating deflationary losses from operations 
in either case the goal is to reflect economic profit of current market conditions 
the table below reflects lifo income or expense representing decreases or increases in the lifo inventory reserve 
the international mill segment exclusively uses the fifo inventory valuation method and thus is not included in this table year ended august  in thousands americas recycling americas mills americas fabrication international marketing and distribution pre tax lifo income expense fiscal year compared to fiscal year americas recycling this segment recorded an adjusted operating profit of million for fiscal  compared with adjusted operating profit of million for the decline in profitability in was due to a decrease in both ferrous and nonferrous volumes and average selling prices 
additionally  in this segment was impacted by nonferrous margin compression of approximately when compared to we exported of our ferrous scrap tonnage and of our nonferrous scrap tonnage during the following table reflects our americas recycling segment average selling prices per ton and tons shipped in thousands for the years ended august increase decrease amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped americas mills we include our five domestic steel minimills and the scrap locations which directly support the steel minimills in our americas mills segment 
this segment recorded an adjusted operating profit of million for  compared with adjusted operating profit of million for the decline in profitability was partially due to a decrease in pre tax lifo income of million from to additionally  both volumes and selling prices within this segment were lower in when compared to rebar accounted for of tonnage shipped  an increase over the prior year 
lower electrical and alloy rates resulted in an overall decrease of million in electrode  alloys and energy costs 
shipments included thousand tons of billets in as compared to thousand tons of billets in the table below reflects our domestic steel minimills operating statistics in thousands and average prices per short ton for the years ended august increase decrease amount tons melted tons rolled tons shipped average mill selling price finished goods average mill selling price total sales average cost of ferrous scrap consumed average metal margin average ferrous scrap purchase price americas fabrication this segment recorded an adjusted operating profit of million for  marking a significant improvement over the adjusted operating loss in of million 
the segment continued to experience margin expansion as input pricing declined while transactional selling prices improved when compared to at august   the composite average fabrication selling price was per ton  up from per ton at august  additionally  pre tax lifo income for was million  compared with pre tax lifo income of million for the tables below show our average fabrication selling prices per short ton and total fabrication plant shipments for the year ended august increase decrease average selling price excluding stock and buyout sales amount rebar structural post increase decrease tons shipped in thousands amount rebar structural post international mill this segment recorded an adjusted operating profit of million for  compared with an adjusted operating profit of million in volumes declined  or approximately thousand tons  primarily related to our merchant and wire rod products 
international mill selling prices also declined per ton to per ton during included in the results was a loss of million on the sale of a rebar fabrication shop in rosslau  germany 
the lack of meaningful market improvements across europe continued to challenge this segment 
shipments in included thousand tons of billets compared to thousand tons of billets in the table below reflects our international mill operating statistics in thousands and average prices per short ton increase decrease amount tons melted tons rolled tons shipped average mill selling price total sales average cost of ferrous scrap consumed average metal margin average ferrous scrap purchase price international marketing and distribution this segment recorded an adjusted operating profit of million for  compared with an adjusted operating profit of million in the reduced profitability is primarily due to million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges related to our australia operations  as well as other one time costs for exiting unprofitable locations 
decreased revenues and margins in our raw materials business and losses from our australian operations also adversely affected this segment results 
additionally  overall weakness in global markets we serve continue to negatively impact this segment results 
within this segment  our us based trading divisions recorded pre tax lifo income of million for  an increase of million over during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our ownership interest in trinecke zelezarny  as trinecke  a czech republic joint stock company  for million resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
corporate our corporate expenses decreased by million in to million primarily as a result of our continued cost containment initiatives when compared to the prior year 
continuing operations data consolidated data the lifo method of inventory valuation increased our net earnings from continuing operations by million for  compared with an increase in our net earnings of million for selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consolidated sg a expenses decreased million  or  for as compared to the costs were down as a result of our cost containment initiatives 
interest expense our interest expense increased by million to million during as compared to due to an increase in interest expense as a result of the increase in our long term debt in  offset by the settlement of our interest rate swap transactions in the resulting gain was deferred and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective debt tranches 
income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended august  was as compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate to for the year ended august  over the statutory tax rate of is due to the mix and amount of pre tax income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the recognition of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions that are not more likely than not to be realized 
our effective tax rates can be impacted by state and local taxes as well as by earnings or losses from foreign jurisdictions 
state and local taxes are generally consistent while the composition of domestic and foreign earnings can create larger fluctuations in the rate 
during the year ended august   the company recognized a tax loss in the amount of million related to its investments in its croatian subsidiary 
as a result  a tax benefit of million was recorded from these losses in continuing operations for the year ended august  the company reported and disclosed the investment loss on its us tax return as ordinary worthless stock and bad debt deductions 
this tax benefit is the primary reason for the variance from the statutory tax rate of 
discontinued operations data adjusted operating profit from discontinued operations was million in  compared with an adjusted operating loss of million and million in and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to sell howell  our wholly owned copper tube manufacturing operation 
we determined that the decision to sell this business met the definition of a discontinued operation 
as result  we have included howell in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
howell was previously an operating segment included in the americas mills reporting segment 
on october   we sold all of the stock of howell for million  subject to customary purchase price adjustments 
during  we announced our decision to exit cmc sisak  doo cmcs by closure of the facility and sale of the assets 
we determined that the decision to exit this business met the definition of a discontinued operation and has been presented as such for all periods presented 
the results for include approximately million of impairment and other charges incurred at cmcs 
the results for consist of severance cost of million associated with closing the facility and a pre tax gain of million for the sale of all of the shares of the cmcs operation  excluding million in assets which were sold in the first quarter of with no impact to the consolidated statements of operations 
cmcs operations were previously included as part of the international mill segment 
see note  businesses held for sale  discontinued operations and dispositions 
outlook we are encouraged by our ability to post another positive earnings quarter and strong cash flows even after factoring in restructuring charges recorded in our fiscal fourth quarter 
from a us perspective  we are further encouraged by the strength of the architecture billings index abi  posting a for august  the highest mark since february 
in addition  the abi has been above for of the last months which historically has been a good leading indicator of improved non residential construction 
our international mill segment should see an improvement in margins in light of the newly passed legislation to curb vat circumvention arrangements in poland 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year americas recycling the decrease in adjusted operating profit during resulted in part from lower nonferrous average selling prices and volumes primarily from reduced export demand within asia coupled with ferrous margin compression 
lifo income was million for as compared to lifo expense of million for we exported of our ferrous scrap tonnage and of our nonferrous scrap tonnage during the following table reflects our americas recycling segment average selling prices per ton and tons shipped in thousands for the years ended august increase decrease amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped americas mills we include our five domestic steel minimills and the scrap locations which directly support the steel minimills in our americas mills segment 
this segment recorded an adjusted operating profit of million for  as compared with adjusted operating profit of million for the results were primarily impacted from the change in lifo to income of million in as compared to lifo expense of million in results were also positively impacted from higher shipments and better margin 
the arizona mill in its third full year of operations has been profitable for the last two years 
rebar accounted for of tonnage shipped  consistent with the prior year 
higher electrical and alloy rates resulted in an overall increase of million in electrode  alloys and energy costs 
shipments included thousand tons of billets in as compared to thousand tons of billets in the table below reflects our domestic steel minimills operating statistics in thousands and average prices per short ton for the year ended august increase decrease amount tons melted tons rolled tons shipped average mill selling price finished goods average mill selling price total sales average cost of ferrous scrap consumed average metal margin average ferrous scrap purchase price americas fabrication this segment recorded an improvement in adjusted operating results of million as compared to included in the results is impairment  severance and closure costs of million for closing certain rebar fabrication and construction services locations 
the segment benefited from stable material pricing and improved market conditions in commercial construction markets resulting in stronger volume and pricing 
backlogs increased in both prices and tonnage in as compared to we are continuing to see encouraging results of market recovery as this segment backlogs continue to be near all time highs in tonnage and total value 
additionally  lifo changed to income of million in as compared to lifo expense of million in the composite average fabrication selling price was per ton in  up from per ton in the tables below show our average fabrication selling prices per short ton and total fabrication plant shipments for the year ended august increase decrease average selling price excluding stock and buyout sales amount rebar structural post increase decrease tons shipped in thousands amount rebar structural post international mill this segment had an adjusted operating profit of million during as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million during included in the results is a loss of million on the sale of a rebar fabrication shop in rosslau  germany 
our polish operations set full year production and shipping records in the mill operation in  primarily on the strength of rebar and billet demand 
shipments in included thousand tons of billets compared to thousand tons of billets in the table below reflects our international mill operating statistics in thousands and average prices per short ton increase decrease amount tons melted tons rolled tons shipped average mill selling price total sales average ferrous scrap production cost average metal margin average ferrous scrap purchase price international marketing and distribution this segment reported an increase in sales of and reported an adjusted operating profit of million for as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million during  primarily due to losses on iron ore contracts  reduced demand in some of our key products and uncertainty concerning economic stimulus in china 
this segment recorded lifo income of million for compared to lifo expense of million for corporate our corporate expenses decreased by million in to million primarily as a result of our cost containment initiatives  partially offset by million in fees and expenses associated with a proxy contest and hostile tender offer 
continuing operations data consolidated data the lifo method of inventory valuation increased our net earnings from continuing operations by approximately million for as compared to increasing our net loss by approximately million for selling  general and administrative sg a expenses our overall sg a expenses decreased by million  or  for as compared to the costs were down as a result of our cost containment initiatives offset by expenses associated with a proxy contest and hostile tender offer 
impairment of assets our impairment of assets decreased by million as a result of impairments related to closure of certain rebar fabrication and construction services locations 
there were no significant impairments in interest expense our interest expense decreased by million to million during as compared to primarily from lower average debt outstanding internationally 
income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended august  was as compared to in the company recognized a tax benefit of million for ordinary worthless stock and bad debt deductions on the investment in cmcs 
the company also recorded a tax benefit of million in related to federal and state research and experimentation expenditures 
these tax benefits are the primary reason for the variance from the statutory tax rate of 
additionally  the effective tax rate is increased by state and local taxes  while earnings generated in foreign jurisdictions decrease the rate 
state and local taxes are generally consistent while the composition of domestic and foreign earnings can create larger fluctuations in the rate 
liquidity and capital resources see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information 
while we believe the lending institutions participating in our credit arrangements are financially capable  it is important to note that the banking and capital markets periodically experience volatility that may limit our ability to raise capital 
additionally  changes to our credit rating by any rating agency may negatively impact our ability to raise capital and our financing costs 
the table below reflects our sources  facilities and availability of liquidity as of august  in thousands total facility availability cash and cash equivalents n a revolving credit facility domestic receivable sales facility international accounts receivable sales facilities bank credit facilities uncommitted notes due from to equipment notes we believe we have access to additional financing and refinancing  if needed 
all of our notes due from to require interest only payments until maturity 
we expect cash from operations to be sufficient to meet all interest and principal payments due within the next twelve months  and we believe we will be able to obtain additional financing or to refinance these notes when they mature 
cmc poland sp 
zoo cmcp formerly cmc zawiercie zoo or cmcz has uncommitted credit facilities of pln million million with several banks with expiration dates ranging from september  to march  the company intends to renew the uncommitted credit facilities upon expiration 
during  cmcp had total borrowings of million and total repayments of million under these facilities 
at august   no amounts were outstanding under these facilities 
the maximum availability under our million revolving credit facility can be increased to million with the consent of both parties 
the facility capacity  with a sublimit of million for letters of credit  is reduced by outstanding stand by letters of credit which totaled million at august  under the credit facility  we were required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to interest expense  as each is defined in the facility of not less than to for the twelve month cumulative period ended november  and for each fiscal quarter on a rolling twelve month cumulative period thereafter 
at august   our interest coverage ratio was to 
the credit facility also requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed to 
at august   our debt to capitalization ratio was to 
the credit facility provides for interest based on the libor  the eurodollar rate or bank of america prime rate 
at august   we were in compliance with all covenants related to our debt agreements 
our foreign operations generated approximately of our revenue in  and as a result  our foreign operations had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million at august  and  respectively 
historically  our domestic operations have generated the majority of our cash  which has been used to fund the cash needs of our domestic operations as well as our foreign operations 
additionally  our domestic operations have access to the million revolving credit facility and the million sale of receivable program described below 
it is the company intention to indefinitely reinvest all undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries 
while not expected  if a repatriation occurs in the future  we would be required to provide for taxes on repatriated earnings from our non us subsidiaries 
determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation 
we regularly maintain a substantial amount of accounts receivable 
we actively monitor our accounts receivable and  based on market conditions and customers financial condition  we record allowances as soon as we believe accounts are uncollectible 
continued pressure on the liquidity of our customers could result in additional reserves as we make our assessments in the future 
we use credit insurance both in the us and internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency 
we estimate that the amount of credit insured receivables and those covered by export letters of credit was approximately of total receivables at august  for added flexibility  we may sell certain accounts receivable both in the us and internationally 
see note  sales of accounts receivable  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
our domestic sale of accounts receivable program contains certain cross default provisions whereby a termination event could occur if we default under certain of our credit arrangements 
additionally  our sales of accounts receivable program contains covenants that are consistent with the covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities result primarily from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products and other raw materials used in steel manufacturing 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
from time to time  we use futures or forward contracts to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  metal commodity prices and natural gas prices 
see note  derivatives and risk management  to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net cash flows from operating activities were million and million in and  respectively 
the million decline in cash flow from operations is primarily due to the following net earnings for fiscal declined by million when compared to see further discussion under the consolidated results of operations above 
deferred income taxes changed by million from from a benefit of million in to an expense of million in the net change in operating assets and liabilities was a reduced cash inflow of million during fiscal compared to fiscal the most significant components of change within the operating assets and liabilities are as follows accounts receivable excluding the impacts of our accounts receivable sales program  cash inflows from accounts receivable decreased in when compared to  as a result of an increase in our days sales outstanding from days at august  to days at august  the increase in days sales outstanding is primarily due to higher sales volume in our americas fabrication segment  which typically has longer customer payment terms than our other segments 
inventory cash generated from inventory during was lower when compared to as overall net sales declined year over year  we continue to adjust our operating levels to reflect changing market demands  while maintaining stocking levels that allow us to meet our customers needs 
furthermore  our days sales in inventory increased three days in from days in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other payables cash outflows from payables and accrued expenses declined million during when compared to fiscal the decline is a reflection of the overall reduction in net sales as well as lower accruals for compensation and benefits when compared to the prior year 
net cash flows used by investing activities were million and million in and  respectively 
for the year ended august   we invested million in capital expenditures offset by million in proceeds from the november sale of our trinecke investment and million in proceeds from sales of other long lived assets 
we estimate that our capital budget will be between million and million 
we regularly assess our capital spending and reevaluate our requirements based on current and expected results 
net cash flows from financing activities were million in  while net cash flows used by financing activities were million in in may  we issued million of senior notes due may  the notes and received proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs 
we used million of the proceeds from the notes to purchase all of our outstanding million of notes due the notes 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on may and november of each year  beginning on november  we may  at any time  redeem the notes at a redemption price equal to percent of the principal amount  plus a make whole premium described in the indenture 
additionally  if a change of control triggering event occurs  as defined by the terms of the indenture  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to percent of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
we are generally not limited under the indenture governing the notes in our ability to incur additional indebtedness provided we are in compliance with certain restrictive covenants  including restrictions on liens  sale and leaseback transactions  mergers  consolidations and transfers of substantially all of our assets 
these covenants are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 
during  we had net short term borrowings of million and a decrease of million in our usage of documentary letters of credit 
our cash dividend payments were million and million in and  respectively 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year during  we generated million of net cash flows from operating activities as compared to generating million during this increase resulted primarily from a significant improvement in pre tax earnings and improvements in operations for working capital 
significant fluctuations in working capital were as follows inventory inventory decreased during the year ended as compared to the fourth quarter of as inventory levels were matched to lower sales in the fourth quarter as compared to fourth quarter days sales in inventory was days and days as of august  and  respectively 
accounts payable and accrued expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased as our expenses were lower from decreased sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of during  we used million of net cash flows from investing activities as compared to using million in we invested million in property  plant and equipment during  an increase of million over additionally  proceeds from disposal of assets and businesses were million in  an increase of million over during  we sold all outstanding shares of cmcs  excluding certain assets that were sold in june and september  and we also sold a rebar fabrication shop in rosslau  germany 
additionally  we generated cash of million in from the release of deposits for letters of credit 
during  we sold assets of our joist and deck business and sold the forms of our heavy forms rental business 
during  we used million of net cash flows from financing activities as compared to using million during the reduction in cash used was primarily due to approximately million of proceeds from the termination of our interest rate swaps during which was partially offset by a reduction in the usage of documentary letters of credit of million 
our cash dividends remained consistent for and our contractual obligations for the next twelve months of approximately million are expenditures incurred in connection with normal revenue producing activities 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities and credit facilities are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 
total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding scheduled maturities of our long term debt 
interest payments related to our short term debt are not included in the table as they do not represent a significant obligation as of august  includes minimum lease payment obligations for noncancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding minimum lease commitments payable for noncancelable operating leases 
approximately of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include all enforceable  legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  regardless of the duration of the agreement 
agreements with variable terms are excluded because we are unable to estimate the minimum amounts 
another significant obligation relates to capital expenditures 
the company provides certain eligible executives benefits pursuant to a nonqualified benefit restoration plan brp plan equal to amounts that would have been available under the tax qualified plans under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  but for limitations of erisa  tax laws and regulations 
the deferred compensation liability under the brp plan was million at august  and is included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we generally expect to fund future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
we did not include estimated payments related to brp in the above contractual obligation table 
refer to note  employees retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
a certain number of employees  primarily outside of the us  participate in defined benefit plans maintained in accordance with local regulations 
at august   the company liability related to the unfunded status of the defined benefit plans was million 
we generally expect to fund future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
we did not include estimated payments related to defined benefit plans in the table above 
refer to note  employees retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the company other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets include deferred tax liabilities  gross unrecognized tax benefits  and the related gross interest and penalties 
as of august   the company had noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of million 
in addition  as of august   the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and an additional million for gross interest and penalties classified as noncurrent liabilities 
at this time  the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities  therefore  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table 
other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our insurance providers and suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements we provide guarantees and issue standby letters of credit to our vendors  customers  insurance providers and governmental agencies in the normal course of business 
these arrangements do not have  and we do not expect them to have  a material effect on our liquidity 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
contingencies see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the potential impact of these contingencies 
we do not believe that any currently pending legal proceedings to which we are a party will have a material adverse effect  individually or in the aggregate  on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
environmental and other matters the information set forth in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report is hereby incorporated by reference 
general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations in all locations where we have operating facilities 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over nine decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  may expose us and our industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of contaminated sites 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency epa  or an equivalent state agency  has notified us that we are considered a prp at ten sites  none of which are owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla  or a similar state statute  to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
because of various factors  including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the extended time periods over which such costs may be incurred  we cannot reasonably estimate our ultimate costs of compliance with cercla 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  we had million and million accrued as of august  and  respectively  in connection with cercla sites 
we have accrued for these liabilities based upon our best estimates 
the amounts paid and the expenses incurred on these sites for the years ended august   and were not material 
historically  the amounts that we have ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined  or into publicly owned treatment works 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters or into publicly owned treatment works  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa regulations and comparable state regulations may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge or non compliance with permit requirements  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increase scrutiny in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources may be required to construct emission sources using what is referred to as the best available control technology  or in any areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards  using methods that satisfy requirements for lowest achievable emission rate 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require specific sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 
we incurred environmental expenses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the expenses included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
in addition  we spent million in capital expenditures related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
we accrued environmental liabilities of million at august  and  respectively  of which million and million were classified as other long term liabilities at august  and  respectively 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive quarters 
we paid dividends in at the rate of per share for each quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and assumptions  including those related to the valuation allowances for receivables  the carrying value of non current assets  reserves for environmental obligations and income taxes  on an ongoing basis 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ materially from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply to the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are delivered based on the terms of the sale  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
when we estimate that a contract with one of our customers will result in a loss  we accrue the calculated loss as soon as it is probable and estimable 
we account for fabrication projects based on the percentage of completion accounting method  based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost 
changes to total estimated contract cost  or loss  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
these reserves are based on historical trends  current market conditions and customers financial condition 
income taxes we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings  our estimate of current and expected future earnings  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and current and future ownership changes 
our effective income tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to various factors  including  but not limited to  total earnings and the mix of earnings by jurisdiction  the timing of changes in tax laws  and the amount of tax provided for uncertain tax positions 
we establish income tax liabilities to reduce some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  or the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
our evaluation of whether or not a tax position is uncertain is based on the following we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
we adjust these income tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of new information 
any change will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
we calculate our lifo reserve by using quantities and costs at period end and recording the resulting lifo income or expense in its entirety 
inventory cost for international and remaining inventories is determined by the first in  first out method  or fifo 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
elements of cost in finished goods inventory in addition to the cost of material include depreciation  amortization  utilities  consumable production supplies  maintenance  production  wages and transportation costs 
additionally  the costs of departments that support production  including materials management and quality control  are allocated to inventory 
goodwill we perform our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when changes in circumstances indicate an impairment event may have occurred by estimating the fair value of each reporting unit compared to its carrying value 
our reporting units represent an operating segment or a reporting level below an operating segment 
additionally  the reporting units are aggregated based on similar economic characteristics  nature of products and services  nature of production processes  type of customers and distribution methods 
we use a discounted cash flow model and a market approach to calculate the fair value of our reporting units 
the model includes a number of significant assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows including discount rates  volumes  prices  capital expenditures and the impact of current market conditions 
these estimates could be materially impacted by adverse changes in market conditions 
as a result of the goodwill impairment tests in  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million  including foreign currency translation gains of million  related to our australian subsidiaries 
the annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairment charges at any of our other reporting units 
the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded carrying value by at least 
as of august  and  one of our reporting units within the americas fabrication reporting segment comprised million of our total goodwill 
goodwill at other reporting units is not material 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the undiscounted future cash flows from operations 
if an impairment exists  the net book values are reduced to fair values as warranted 
our domestic and international minimills  fabrication and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations are based upon judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economical useful lives 
to the extent that an asset actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments in connection with some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not materially affect our results of operations  our financial position or our cash flows

the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding or utilized during  in accordance with our risk management program 
all of the instruments are highly liquid  and not entered into for trading purposes 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of cmc or its subsidiaries 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on metal commodity futures exchange quotes  which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity futures contracts for copper  aluminum  nickel and zinc 
these futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margin due to the volatility of the commodity prices on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to minimal gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
natural gas we enter into natural gas forward contracts as economic hedges of the company americas mills operations based on anticipated consumption of natural gas in order to mitigate the risk of unanticipated increases in operating cost due to the volatility of natural gas prices 
as of august   the company had no open natural gas forward contract commitments 
freight we occasionally enter into freight forward contracts when sales commitments to customers include a fixed price freight component in order to mitigate the effect of the volatility of ocean freight rates 
as of august   the company had no open freight forward contract commitments 
interest rates we enter into interest rate swap contracts to maintain a portion of our debt obligations at variable interest rates 
these interest rate swap contracts  under which we have agreed to pay variable rates of interest and receive fixed rates of interest  are designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt 
during the third quarter of  the company terminated its existing interest rate swap transactions with a notional value of million and received cash proceeds of approximately million  net of customary finance charges
