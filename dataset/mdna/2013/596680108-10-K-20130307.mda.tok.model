recent developments superstorm sandy during the last week of october  our businesses  primarily in new jersey  were impacted by superstorm sandy 
the most significant impact was widespread power outages caused by the storm s heavy winds and rain 
because all of our critical water and wastewater facilities are equipped with emergency power generators  we were able to maintain service to our customers during the storm  as well as in its aftermath 
the storm did not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

rates middlesex in july  the new jersey board of public utilities njbpu approved an million increase in middlesex s annual base water rates 
a base rate increase request of million was filed in january seeking recovery of increased costs of operations  chemicals  fuel  electricity  taxes  labor and benefits and decreases in industrial and commercial customer demand patterns  as well as capital investment in utility plant 
the new base rates are designed to generate sufficient revenue to recover these increased costs and offset the lower customer demands  as well as provide a return on invested capital in rate base of million  based on a return on equity of 
the rate increase became effective on july  in november  middlesex filed a petition with the njbpu seeking approval of foundational information foundational filing that would allow for the implementation of a distribution system improvement charge dsic 
a dsic is a rate mechanism that allows water utilities to recover investment in capital improvements to their water distribution system made between base rate proceedings 
in february  the foundational filing was approved by the njbpu  which allows middlesex to implement a dsic rate in september to recover costs for qualifying projects that are placed in service in the six month post approval period 
the dsic rate is allowed to increase in three subsequent six month periods for any additional qualifying projects placed in service during those time periods 
the maximum annual revenues allowed to be recovered under the approved foundational filing is million 
in september  middlesex filed an application with the njbpu seeking permission to establish a purchased water adjustment clause pwac and implement a tariff rate sufficient to recover increased costs of million to purchase untreated water from the new jersey water supply authority and treated water from a non affiliated regulated water utility 
we cannot predict whether the njbpu will ultimately approve  deny  or reduce the amount of the request 
in march  the njbpu granted an increase in middlesex s annual operating revenues of  or million 
the increase was necessitated by increased costs  as well as to provide a return on invested capital in rate base of million based on a return on equity of 
tidewater in june  the delaware public service commission depsc approved a million increase in tidewater s annual base water rates 
a base rate increase request of million was filed in september seeking recovery of increased costs for operations  maintenance and taxes  as well as capital investment 
under depsc regulations  tidewater had implemented interim rates in november  which amounted to approximately million on an annual basis 
the new final base rates reflect the remaining million and became effective june  effective january   tidewater implemented a depsc approved million dsic rate increase 
tesi in november  tesi filed an application with the depsc seeking approval to purchase all of the utility assets of the customer wastewater system serving the residents of the plantations development the plantations in rehoboth beach  delaware 
the application also requests the transfer of the wastewater franchise from the current owner to tesi 
in connection with this transaction  tesi also filed an application with depsc seeking an approximate million increase in the plantations residents base wastewater rates 
the purchase  and subsequent operation  of the plantation s wastewater system is contingent  among other things  upon the depsc s approval of both applications 
we cannot predict whether the depsc will ultimately approve or deny the purchase and base rate increase 
a decision by the depsc is not expected until the third quarter of 
index in june  the depsc approved a million increase in tesi s annual base wastewater rates  a portion of which is to be phased in through a base rate increase request of million was filed in july seeking recovery of increased operation and maintenance costs  as well as capital investment 
under depsc regulations  tesi had implemented interim rates in september  which amounted to approximately million on an annual basis 
the new final base rates became effective june  pinelands in august  pinelands water and pinelands wastewater filed petitions with the njbpu seeking permission to increase base rates by approximately million and million per year  respectively 
these requests were made as a result of capital investments as well as increased operations and maintenance costs for both companies 
we cannot predict whether the njbpu will ultimately approve  deny  or reduce the amount of the request 
a decision by the njbpu is not expected until the second quarter of southern shores effective june   the depsc approved a multi year agreement for a phased in base rate increase for southern shores 
this increase was made as a result of capital investment in the upgrade and renovation of southern shores primary water treatment facilities  as well as by increased operating costs 
under the terms of the agreement  which expires in  customer rates will increase on january st of each year to generate additional annual revenue of million with each increase 
twin lakes the pennsylvania public utilities commission approved a million  three year phased in base rate increase effective march  this increase was designed to recover capital investment in the upgrade and renovation of the twin lakes system  as well as increased operating costs 
outlook revenues for are expected to be favorably impacted by the full year effect of approved base rate increases for middlesex  tidewater  tesi  southern shores and twin lakes 
the pinelands water and pinelands wastewater base rate increase requests should also contribute to additional revenues in as well as the tidewater dsic and the middlesex pwac and dsic 
both middlesex and tidewater believe it will be necessary to file for an increase in their base rates in the rate increases that pinelands water  pinelands wastewater  tidewater and middlesex filed  or expect to file  have not yet been approved by each company s respective utility commission 
there can be no assurances that the requested rate increases will be approved in whole or in part or when the final decisions will be rendered 
middlesex has received notification from the borough of sayreville  new jersey sayreville  one of middlesex wholesale contract customers  that sayreville will not be renewing its contract for the purchase of water from middlesex 
in accordance with the terms  this contract will remain in effect through august  middlesex is exploring options with sayreville for its ongoing emergency water supply requirements 
gross operating revenues from water sales to sayreville amounted to million in in addition  hess corporation hess  middlesex largest retail water customer  has announced it intends to cease its oil refining operations at its port reading  new jersey facility as early as of the end of february revenues from hess amounted to million in revenue reductions from either of these customers may accelerate the need for middlesex to file a base rate increase petition with the njbpu 
ongoing economic conditions continue to negatively impact our customers water consumption  particularly the level of water usage by our commercial and industrial customers in our middlesex system 
we are unable to determine when these customers water demands may fully return to previous levels  or if a reduced level of demand will continue indefinitely 
we were given appropriate recognition for a portion of this decrease in customer consumption in middlesex s march and july rate increases 

index revenues and earnings are influenced by weather 
changes in usage patterns  as well as increases in capital expenditures and operating costs  are the primary factors in determining the need for rate increase requests 
we continue to implement plans to streamline operations and reduce operating costs 
as a result of ongoing challenging economic conditions impacting the pace of new residential home construction  there may be an increase in the amount of preliminary survey and investigation ps i costs that will not be currently recoverable in rates 
if it is determined that recovery is unlikely  the applicable ps i costs will be charged against income in the period of determination 
improved performance in on our investment of retirement plan funds  partially offset by a lower discount rate  is expected to result in lower employee benefit plan expense and cash contributions in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of employee benefit plans 
our ability to increase operating income and net income is based significantly on four factors weather  adequate and timely rate relief  effective cost management  and customer growth 
these factors are evident in the discussions below which compare our results of operations from prior years 
operating results by segment the company has two operating segments  regulated and non regulated 
our regulated segment contributed approximately  and of total revenues  and approximately  and of net income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the discussion of the company s results of operations is on a consolidated basis  and includes significant factors by subsidiary 
the segments in the tables included below are comprised of the following companies regulated middlesex  tidewater  pinelands  southern shores  tesi and twin lakes  non regulated usa  usa pa  and white marsh 
results of operations in compared to millions of dollars years ended december  regulated non regulated total regulated non regulated total revenues operations and maintenance depreciation other taxes operating income other income  net interest expense income taxes net income 
index operating revenues operating revenues for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in this increase was attributable to the following factors middlesex system revenues increased million  primarily due to o sales to general meter service customers increased by million  primarily due to the july base water rate increase  and o contract sales to municipalities increased by million  primarily due to the july base water rate  tidewater system revenues increased million  primarily due to interim and final rate increases that went into effect in november and june  respectively  and increased connection fees  usa s revenues increased million  primarily due to revenues earned under contracts to operate the avalon water utility  sewer utility and storm water systems and the sunoco eagle point biological wastewater treatment facility  both of which commenced in  usa pa s revenues increased million  primarily from scheduled increases in the fixed fees paid under contract with perth amboy  revenues in southern shores  tesi and twin lakes collectively increased million  primarily due to rate increases that went into effect in  and revenues from all other subsidiaries decreased million 
operation and maintenance expense operation and maintenance expenses for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in this increase was related to the following factors employee benefit expenses increased million due to changes in certain postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions  including a lower discount rate and revised plan participant mortality factors  as well as a lower actual return on assets held in our retirement plan funds  labor costs increased million due to higher average labor rates  additional personnel hired for usa s new contract operations serving avalon and the sunoco eagle point biological wastewater treatment facility and lower capitalized payroll 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of employee positions in our delaware workforce and less overtime expended on emergency repairs  expenditures for start up activities and billable additional services under usa s new contract operations serving avalon and the sunoco eagle point biological wastewater treatment facility resulted in a million increase  and operation and maintenance expenses for all other categories increased million 
depreciation depreciation expense for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in due to a higher level of utility plant in service 
other taxes other taxes for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in  primarily due to increased revenue related taxes on higher revenues in our middlesex system 
other income  net other income  net for the year ended december  decreased million from the same period in  primarily due to a gain of million recognized in the third quarter of resulting from the sale of usa s linecare contracts to homeserve and lower allowance for funds used during construction  resulting from lower average construction work in progress balances

index white marsh s revenues decreased million primarily due to the expiration of a wastewater operations contract in august  with the transfer of usa s linecare contracts to homeserve  usa s revenues decreased million 
usa now earns a service fee for the billing  cash collection and other administrative matters associated with homeserve s service contracts  scheduled increases in the fixed fees paid under contract with perth amboy increased usa pa s revenues by million  and southern shores revenues increased million due to the implementation of a june rate increase

index net income and earnings per share net income for the year ended december  decreased million from the same period in basic and diluted earnings per share decreased to and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  in addition to the effect of the decrease in net income  earnings per share also decreased from a higher number of average shares outstanding in due to the company s public offering of million shares of common stock in june liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations are largely based on four factors weather  adequate and timely rate increases  effective cost management and customer growth 
the effect of those factors on net income is discussed in the results of operations section above 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities increased million to million 
increased earnings  lower receivables and timing of certain income tax payments were the primary reasons for the increase in cash flow 
the million of net cash flow from operations enabled us to fund of our utility plant expenditures internally for the period 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million 
as described more fully in the results of operations section above  decreased earnings was the primary reason for the decrease in cash flow 
the million of net cash flow from operations enabled us to fund approximately of our utility plant expenditures internally for the period 
increases in certain operating costs impact our liquidity and capital resources 
pinelands water and pinelands wastewater both filed for rate increases during the third quarter of both middlesex and tidewater anticipate filing for a rate increase in there can be no assurances however  that the respective utility commissions will approve the pending or anticipated rate increase requests in whole or in part or when the decisions will be rendered 
we continually monitor the need for timely rate filing to minimize the lag between the time we experience increased operating and capital costs and the time we receive appropriate rate relief 
capital expenditures and commitments to fund our capital program  we use internally generated funds  short term and long term debt borrowings and  when market conditions are favorable  proceeds from sales of common stock under our dividend reinvestment program drp and offerings to the public 
the table below summarizes our estimated capital expenditures for the years millions distribution system production system computer systems other total estimated capital expenditures our estimated capital expenditures for the items listed above are primarily comprised of the following distribution system projects associated with installation and relocation of water mains and service lines  construction of water storage tanks  installation and replacement of hydrants and meters and our renew program  which is our initiative to clean and cement all unlined mains in the middlesex system 
in connection with our renew program  we expect to annually spend million in  and production system projects associated with our water production and water treatment plants 

index computer systems purchase of hardware and software 
other purchase of vehicles and other transportation equipment  tools  furniture  laboratory equipment  security requirements and other general infrastructure needs 
the actual amount and timing of capital expenditures is dependent on customer growth  residential new home construction and sales and project scheduling 
to pay for our capital program in  we plan on utilizing internally generated funds  proceeds from the sale of common stock through the drp  funds available and held in trust under existing new jersey state revolving fund srf loans currently  million and delaware srf loans currently  million and  once the loan transaction is complete  proceeds from the new jersey srf program

long term debt 
subject to regulatory approval  the company periodically finances capital projects under srf loan programs in new jersey and delaware 
these government programs provide financing at interest rates that are typically below rates available in the broader financial markets 
a portion of the borrowings under the new jersey srf is interest free 
we participated in the new jersey srf loan program during and expect to participate in the new jersey srf program for up million  with an expected closing date in may in november  middlesex completed the transaction for the redemption and refinance of million of first mortgage bonds bonds 
the bonds were originally issued in five separate transactions or series under the loan program of the new jersey economic development authority njeda and were replaced with three new series of bonds designated as series qq  rr and ss totaling million issued through the njeda  net of a million issuance premium 
the restricted proceeds of the new bonds were used to redeem million of the original bonds in december and million of the original bonds in january the njeda does not guarantee the debt 
the tax exempt nature of the interest paid to bondholders remains in place 
the transaction was designed to extend the maturity date and reduce the interest cost for the underlying debt 
annual debt service expenses are expected to decline by approximately million 
in may  middlesex borrowed million through the new jersey environmental infrastructure trust under the new jersey srf loan program and issued bonds designated as series oo million and series pp million

the company closed on the first mortgage bonds designated as series mm and nn in december proceeds may only be used for the middlesex renew program 

index in march  tidewater closed on a million loan with the delaware srf program which allows  but does not obligate  tidewater to draw against a general obligation note for a specific project

common stock 
in june  the company sold and issued million shares of common stock in a public offering that was priced at per share 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay certain of the company s short term debt outstanding 
the company periodically issues shares of common stock in connection with its drp 
the company raised million through the issuance of million shares under the drp during contractual obligations in the course of normal business activities  the company enters into a variety of contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
some of these items result in direct obligations on the company s balance sheet while others are commitments  some firm and some based on uncertainties  which are disclosed in the company s other underlying consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents our known contractual obligations for the periods specified as of december  payment due by period millions of dollars total less than year years years more than years long term debt notes payable interest on long term debt purchased water contracts wastewater operations total does not include premium on long term debt the table above does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for postretirement benefit plan obligations 
the effect on the timing and amount of these payments resulting from potential changes in actuarial assumptions and returns on plan assets cannot be estimated 
in  the company contributed million to its postretirement benefit plans and expects to contribute a similar amount in 
index critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and standards often requires the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to the calculation of pension and postretirement benefits  unbilled revenues  and the recoverability of certain assets  including regulatory assets 
the company bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and current operating environment 
changes in any of the variables that are used for the company s estimates  assumptions and judgments may lead to significantly different financial statement results 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
regulatory accounting we maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries  which account for approximately of operating revenues and of total assets  are subject to regulation in the states in which they operate 
those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities rules and guidelines  which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements 
in those instances  the company follows the guidance in the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic regulated operations regulatory accounting 
in accordance with regulatory accounting  costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate making purposes in future rates 
accordingly  we have recorded costs and obligations  which will be amortized over various future periods 
any change in the assessment of the probability of rate making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item 
we have no reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded will be treated differently by the regulators in the future 
revenues revenues from metered customers include amounts billed on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
the estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which may include historical consumption usage  current weather patterns and economic conditions 
differences between estimated revenues and actual billings are recorded in a subsequent period 
revenues from unmetered customers are billed at a fixed tariff rate in advance at the beginning of each service period and are recognized in revenue ratably over the service period 
revenues from the perth amboy management contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees 
fixed fees  which have been set for the life of the contract  are billed monthly and recorded as earned 
variable fees  which are based on billings and other factors  are recorded upon approval of the amount by perth amboy 
the variable fees are not a material component of the management contract 
postretirement benefit plans the costs for providing postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
future postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other demographic factors related to the population participating in the company s postretirement benefit plans  all of which can change significantly in future years 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan which covers all currently active employees who were hired prior to march  in addition  the company maintains an unfunded supplemental plan for its executive officers 

index the company has a postretirement benefit plan other than pensions other benefits plan for substantially all of its retired employees 
employees hired after march  are not eligible to participate in the other benefits plan 
coverage includes healthcare and life insurance 
the allocation by asset category of postretirement benefit plan assets at december  and is as follows pension plan other benefits plan asset category target range equity securities debt securities cash commodities total the discount rate  compensation increase rate and long term rate of return utilized for determining our postretirement benefit plans future obligations as of december  are as follows pension plan other benefits plan discount rate compensation increase long term rate of return for the valuation  costs and obligations for our other benefits plan assumed a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits in with a decline of per year for and per year for  resulting in an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of by year the following is a sensitivity analysis for certain actuarial assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations pbo and expenses for our postretirement benefit plans pension plan actuarial assumptions estimated increase decrease on pbo s estimated increase decrease on expense s discount rate increase  discount rate decrease   other benefits plan actuarial assumptions estimated increase decrease on pbo s estimated increase decrease on expense s discount rate increase  discount rate decrease   healthcare cost trend rate increase   healthcare cost trend rate decrease   
index the discount rates used at our december measurement date for determining future postretirement benefit plans obligations and costs are determined based on market rates for long term  high quality corporate bonds specific to our pension plan and other benefits plan s asset allocation 
the expected long term rate of return for pension plan and other benefits plan assets is determined based on historical returns and our asset allocation 
recent accounting standards see note q of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

index ite m a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of existing long term debt instruments will mature 
applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on our earnings 
our risks associated with commodity price increases for chemicals  electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the ability to recover price increases through rates 
non performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we are exposed to credit risk through for both our regulated and non regulated business segments 
our regulated operations serve residential  commercial  industrial and municipal customers while our non regulated operations engage in business activities with developers  government entities and other customers 
our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non payment of customer accounts receivable balances 
our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements 
our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations 
in addition  our regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 
the company postretirement benefit plan assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities 
changes to the company postretirement benefit plan assets value can impact the company postretirement benefit plan expense  funded status and future minimum funding requirements 
our risk is reduced through our ability to recover postretirement benefit plan costs through rates
