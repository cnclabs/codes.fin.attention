item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed in the section titled risk factors included in part i  item a 
of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading supplier of high performance ics that are used primarily by manufacturers of networking systems for carrier and enterprise networking applications 
we design  develop and market a diverse portfolio of high performance  low power and cost competitive networking and connectivity ic solutions 
for more than years  we have been a leader in the adoption of new technologies in carrier and enterprise networking 
both bandwidth demands and complexity  driven by the introduction of new content rich services  the convergence of voice  video and data  and enhanced g lte mobile networks  have risen dramatically in carrier and enterprise networks 
media rich devices  such as smartphones and game consoles  require increased bandwidth 
new enterprise deployment options  such as cloud based services and social media and telepresence  also spur demand 
more recently  there is a trend for increased ethernet deployment within networks used in industrial and military networking  automotive transport  and future smart grid applications  collectively referred to as iot 
as a result  carrier  enterprise  and increasingly  iot networks are transitioning to all ip and packet based ethernet networks that can scale in terms of services  bandwidth and capability  while lowering power consumption and acquisition and operations costs 
these networks are based on technology that is significantly more sophisticated  service aware  secure and reliable than traditional enterprise grade ethernet lan technology 
such networks are built on new technology that is often referred to as carrier ethernet in carrier networks and converged enhanced ethernet in enterprise networks 
realization of our transition strategy several years ago  we embarked on the strategic mission of re inventing vitesse to take advantage of the dramatic ongoing transformation of our target networking markets 
our objective is to be the leading supplier of high performance ics for the global communications infrastructure markets 
in an effort to diversify ourselves and provide new opportunities for growth  we re positioned our r d teams and invested heavily to enter new markets  develop new products  and penetrate new customers 
to continue to grow our new product revenue  we must win market share in high growth communications market segments 
as with any high technology company  growth opportunities begin with new products 
over the past four years  we introduced many new platform products and technologies that will serve as the basis for future product development 
from that effort  we began sampling the first of our new product portfolio in since then  revenue from these new products has grown to over of total revenues  or million for fiscal our new products have captured design wins at over customers  including market leaders such as alcatel lucent  cisco  ericsson  hewlett packard  huawei  juniper  samsung  and zte 
in  we introduced the third generation of both our switch engine and phy products 
these new products allowed us to significantly increase our served markets in both carrier and enterprise networking 
we have become the clear choice for meeting our customers needs for service delivery  synchronization  security  and signal integrity 
we believe we have effectively and efficiently targeted these high growth infrastructure markets with substantial r d investments over the last five years 
to optimize our r d efficiency  we chose to serve large  growing  independent markets which rely increasingly on ethernet technology carrier and enterprise networks 
as we are now three years into the deployment of these new products  we can see that our target markets and products were well chosen 
increasingly  we also now see opportunities for our products and technology within the iot  where ethernet based networks are emerging 
there is 
table of contents tremendous synergy and cost savings in terms of r d effort to provide ethernet switch and phy products into this emerging adjacent market 
in bringing our new products to market  our customer engagements and number of design opportunities identified by our sales team have consistently increased since early customer adoption of our new products has exceeded our goals 
in  design wins for our new products increased by approximately from while many of these wins represented additional business at our most important customers  what we call same store sales  many others are wins at new customers  and reflect our growing market share 
because our products our highly complex  it takes our customers to months to go from sample availability to first customer shipment  as customers do the necessary development work to complete and qualify their systems in the network 
since it typically takes an additional to months to ramp into full production  we believe design wins represent a good leading indicator of future revenues 
we augment our product revenues by leveraging our substantial intellectual property portfolio to generate revenues 
our primary focus for intellectual property licensing has been our gigabit ethernet cuphy and switch cores and efec technology 
we license to non competing third parties in adjacent or similar markets 
our accounting policy generally uses the sell through model for sales to our distributors 
the sell through model recognizes revenue only upon shipment of the merchandise from our distributor to the final customer 
as such  we may have variability in our revenue from quarter to quarter as customers have substantial flexibility to reschedule backlog with of our distribution partners as part of the terms and conditions of sale 
our distributor sales were  and of product revenue in  and  respectively 
in the normal course of business  we regularly assess our product portfolio to ensure it aligns with our strategy 
at such time  we may determine to phase out products  or eol 
when we eol a product  we typically provide up to six months notice for our customers to make a last time buy of product and six additional months to take receipt of that product 
the eol announcement can result in near term increases in our revenues as customers typically respond to these announcements by making last time buys to ensure that they have adequate stock on hand to support their production forecast 
during the last three years  we accelerated our comprehensive efforts to increase our product gross margins and operating margins  which together have substantially increased our operating leverage 
our efforts in operations include reduction in materials costs and cycle times  improved product yields  implementation of programs such as lean manufacturing  and an enhanced customer centric focus 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we outsource the majority of our manufacturing 
our successful management of our supply chain has provided us with competitive materials pricing and effective lead times for the materials we purchase 
we have sizable advantages due to lower fixed costs  reduced cycle times  and lower inventory resulting from our outsourcing of almost all of our wafer fabrication and assembly 
during periods of strong demand  we could experience longer lead times  difficulties in obtaining capacity  and or difficulty in meeting commitments for our required deliveries during periods of strong demand 
average margins vary widely within the markets we serve  with the carrier networking market having the highest average margins and the enterprise networking market having the lowest average margins 
we endeavor to increase margins by providing products that have significant added value relative to our competition 
in addition  we have strengthened our cash balances by reducing our inventory every fiscal year since september   resulting in a reduction of million over the past three fiscal years 
we have also focused on streamlining our r d and sg a organizations reducing expenses almost over the past three fiscal years 
we leverage top level consultants to help us achieve short term design goals while ensuring we maintain our in house engineering talent to drive our overall corporate objectives 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
these estimates could change under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenues we recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
revenue recognition is deferred where the earnings process is incomplete 
a substantial portion of our product sales is made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or right of return 
our past history with these pricing credits and or right of return provisions prevents us from being able to reasonably estimate the final price of our inventory to be sold and the amount of inventory that could be returned pursuant to these agreements 
as a result  the fixed and determinable revenue recognition criterion has not been met at the time we deliver products allowing for pricing credits or right of returns 
accordingly  product revenue from sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
from time to time  we may ship goods to our distributors with no pricing credits and or no or limited right of return 
under these circumstances  at the time of shipment  product prices are fixed or determinable and the amount of future returns and pricing allowances to be granted in the future can be reasonably estimated and are accrued 
accordingly  revenues are recorded net of these estimated amounts 
intellectual property revenues we derive intellectual property revenues from the sale and licensing of our intellectual property  maintenance and support fees and royalty revenue following the sale by our licensees of products incorporating the licensed technology 
we recognize revenue from the sale and licensing of our intellectual property when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the timing of delivery is dependent on  and varies with  the terms of each contract 
other than maintenance and support  there is no continuing obligation under these arrangements after delivery of the intellectual property 
deferred revenue is created when we bill a customer in accordance with a contract prior to having met the requirements for revenue recognition 
certain of our agreements may contain maintenance and support obligations 
under such agreements we provide unspecified bug fixes and technical support 
no other upgrades  products  or post contract support are provided 
these arrangements may be renewable annually by the customer 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the period during which the obligation exists  typically months or less 
we recognize royalty revenue in the period in which the licensee reports shipment of products incorporating our intellectual property components 
royalties are calculated on a per unit basis  as specified in our agreement with the licensee 
we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenues to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and revenue is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable 
generally  we are not able to determine tpe because our licensing arrangements differ from that of our peers 
we have concluded that no vsoe or tpe exists because it is rare that either we or our competitors sell the deliverables on a stand alone basis 
esps reflect our best estimate of what the selling prices of the elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement  any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition  which could affect our results of operations 
in determining esps  we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors  based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
the facts and circumstances we may consider include  but are not limited to  prices charged for similar offerings  if any  our historical pricing practices as well as the nature and complexity of different technologies being licensed  geographies and the number of uses allowed for a given license 

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor  and overhead 
inventory costs are determined using standard costs which approximate actual costs under the first in  first out method 
costs include the costs of purchased finished products  sorted wafers  and outsourced assembly and test  as well as internal overhead 
we evaluate inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
our evaluation considers market and economic conditions  technology changes  new product introductions  and changes in strategic business direction  and requires estimates that may include elements that are uncertain 
in order to state the inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain reserves against individual stocking units 
inventory write downs  once established  are not reversed until the related inventories have been sold or scrapped 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
fair value we use different valuation methodologies that use level inputs to value our term a and term b loans  debentures and related compound embedded derivative 
the valuation methodologies we use and our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement may produce a fair value that may not be indicative of net realizable value or future fair values 
although we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under asc topic  compensation stock compensation  which requires us to record related compensation costs 
calculating the fair value of stock based compensation awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the awards and expected volatility of our stock price 
expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period 
our estimates of expected volatilities are based on weighted historical implied volatility 
the expected forfeiture rate applied in calculating stock based compensation cost is estimated using historical data and is updated annually 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards involve estimates that require management judgment 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could change significantly in the future 
in addition  if our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could change significantly in the future 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessments of historical losses and projected operating results in future periods on a more likely than not basis 
if and when we generate future taxable income in our tax jurisdictions against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit  the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax 
table of contents positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  new audit activity  and effectively settled issues 
determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period in which a change in judgment occurs 
litigation we are party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
we closely monitor these claims and lawsuits and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may  when resolved have a material adverse affect on our financial position or results or operations and accrue and or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate

table of contents fiscal years ended september  and product revenues we sell our products into the following markets i carrier networking  ii enterprise networking  and iii non core 
the carrier networking market includes core  metro  edge  and access equipment used for transport  switching  routing  mobile access  and backhaul in service provider networks 
the enterprise networking market covers ethernet switching and routing equipment used within lans in sme smb networks and cloud access services 
the non core market is comprised of products that have not received additional investment over the last five fiscal years and  as a result  have generally been in decline 
the demand for our products is affected by various factors  including our development and introduction of new products  availability and pricing of competing products  capacity constraints at our suppliers  eol product decisions  and general economic conditions 
therefore  our revenues for the fiscal years ended and may not necessarily be indicative of future revenues 
product revenue by market is as follows september  amount of product revenues amount of product revenues change change in thousands  except percentages carrier networking enterprise networking non core product revenues the increase in carrier networking revenues is attributable to an almost doubling in sales of our new ethernet switch products  more than tripling in sales of our new connectivity products  and increased sales for our sonet sdh framer products going through eol 
the increases were partially offset by declines in sales from other sonet sdh products 
the decrease in enterprise networking revenues is driven by a decrease in sales of our switch fabrics products that had gone through eol in the prior fiscal year and declines in our mature crosspoint products  partially offset by a more than doubling in sales of our new switch products 
the decrease in non core revenues is largely attributable to a decrease of our legacy fiber channel phys and network processors  some of which had gone through eol in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  a number of older products went through eol 
revenue from these eol products was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year  and we expect these eol revenues will continue to decline 
we also classify our product revenues based on our three product lines i connectivity  ii ethernet switching  and iii transport processing 

table of contents product revenue by product line is as follows september  amount of product revenues amount of product revenues change change in thousands  except percentages connectivity ethernet switching transport processing product revenues although revenues for our new connectivity products increased  connectivity revenues overall decreased due to the broad based decline in the networking equipment market  which negatively impacted the demand for our more mature sonet sdh phy based products 
in addition  there was a strong decline in our legacy non core products  particularly fibre channel phys products 
the increase in ethernet switching revenues is largely attributable to a doubling in our new switches selling into both the carrier and enterprise networking markets 
the increase was partially offset by declines in sales of our mature products 
the decrease in transport processing revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is largely attributable to lower sales of switch fabrics  npus and optical transport network products that had gone through eol in the prior fiscal year 
these increases were offset by increased revenues for sonet framers  going through eol in the current fiscal year 
intellectual property revenue september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages intellectual property revenues intellectual property revenue includes licenses  royalties  and the sale of patents 
for the fiscal year ended september   intellectual property revenue also included the settlement of all future royalties under an existing agreement 
intellectual property revenues decreased in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year due to a decrease in deliverables of intellectual property 
the timing and amounts of intellectual property revenues fluctuate 
expenses associated with intellectual property revenue are included in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
net revenue from customers that were equal to or greater than of total net revenues is as follows september  nu horizons electronics wpg holdings less than of total net revenues for period indicated 
distributors 
table of contents net revenue by geographic area is as follows september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages united states asia pacific emea total net revenues europe  middle east and africa revenue by geographic area is based upon the country of billing 
the geographic location of distributors and third party manufacturing service providers may be different from the geographic location of the ultimate end users 
we believe a substantial portion of the products billed to oems and third party manufacturing service providers in the asia pacific region are ultimately shipped to end markets in the united states and europe 
cost of product revenue september  ti amount of product revenues amount of product revenues change change in thousands  except percentages cost of product revenues we use third parties for wafer fabrication and assembly services 
cost of product revenues consists predominantly of i purchased finished wafers  ii assembly services  iii test services  and iv labor and overhead costs associated with product procurement  planning and quality assurance 
our cost of product revenues is affected by various factors  including product mix  volume  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  material costs  manufacturing efficiencies  and the position of our products within their life cycles 
our cost of product revenues as a percent of net product revenues is affected by these factors  as well as customer mix  volume  pricing  and competitive pricing programs 
although the overall cost of product revenues did not change  the cost as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to a mix of products that had an overall higher cost 
engineering  research and development september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages engineering  research and development r d expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for employees and contractors engaged in research  design and development activities 
r d also includes costs of mask tooling  which we fully expense in the period  and electronic design 
table of contents automation eda tools  software licensing contracts  subcontracting and fabrication costs  depreciation and amortization  and overhead including facilities expenses 
the level of r d expense will vary from period to period  depending on timing of development projects and the purchase of masks aligned to those projects 
the level of r d expense as a percentage of net revenues will vary  depending  in part  on the level of net revenues 
our r d efforts are critical to maintaining a high level of new product introductions and are critical to our plans for future growth 
the decrease in r d expense for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is largely attributable to lower overhead testing expenses of million and other expenses of million  partially offset by higher employee compensation and contractor expenses of million for providing new product development and design services 
selling  general and administrative september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative sg a expense consists primarily of compensation expense  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses  outside labor  and communication expense  and is comparable to the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  our sg a compensation expense decreased by million 
due to the relocation of our main camarillo facility to an adjacent facility  we incurred million in asset retirement expenses as well as increased rent of million 
in fiscal year  we collected million of accounts receivable that was written off as uncollectible in fiscal year fiscal year also included a million write down of an intangible asset 
restructuring and impairment charges september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages restructuring and impairment during fiscal year we consolidated design activities and consolidated our camarillo operations into a single facility  exiting an adjacent leased facility 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that it was unlikely we would be able to sublease the exited property for the remaining lease term through december therefore  we decided that we would reoccupy the exited facility upon expiration of our main camarillo facility lease in january  instead of locating to a new facility as originally planned 
accordingly  we reversed the remaining lease termination reserve of million 
interest expense  net september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages interest expense  net 
table of contents net interest expense is comprised of cash interest expense  amortization of debt discount  premium  and debt issuance costs  net of interest income 
net interest expense for the fiscal year is comparable to the prior fiscal year 
gain on compound embedded derivative september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages gain on compound embedded derivative the gain on our compound embedded derivative related to our debentures is primarily generated by the decrease in the price of our underlying common stock during those periods 
the compound embedded derivative included in our debentures required bifurcation and accounting at fair value because the economic and contractual characteristics of the compound embedded derivative met the criteria for bifurcation and separate accounting due to the conversion price not being indexed to our own stock 
the compound embedded derivative is comprised of the conversion option and a make whole payment for foregone interest if the holder converts the debenture early 
the make whole payment for foregone interest expired october   and upon its expiration  the compound embedded derivative no longer met the criteria for bifurcation as all components of the conversion feature were indexed to our own stock 
a final valuation was completed on october   resulting in gain of million due to the change in fair value 
income tax benefit september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages income tax benefit our effective tax rate was for the fiscal year ended september  compared to for the comparable period in the prior fiscal year 
our income tax benefit is primarily impacted by foreign taxes  a refund of withholding taxes on foreign income that would have been creditable against united states income taxes  and certain nondeductible interest and share based expenses 
the income tax benefit is also impacted by the release of a portion of the valuation allowances related to certain foreign jurisdictions deferred tax assets as such balances were more likely than not realizable within the applicable carryforward period based on our analysis of the available positive and negative evidence 

table of contents fiscal years ended september  and product revenues product revenue by market is as follows september  amount of product revenues amount of product revenues change change in thousands  except percentages carrier networking enterprise networking non core product revenues the decrease in carrier networking revenues is largely attributable to a broad based weakness in our end customer markets for carrier networking  particularly a decline in our sonet sdh products  including framers  eos mappers  and ftth products 
the declines were partially offset by increases in transport products going through eol and in our newer technologies and products  particularly in ethernet cu phys 
the decrease in enterprise networking revenues is driven by declines in gigabit ethernet switch and phy products selling into low end sme smb applications due to overall weak market conditions  primarily in the united states and asia 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in enterprise processing due to revenues from switch fabrics going through eol and an increase in new products 
the increase in non core revenues is largely attributable to increased sales of our mature network processors and fibre channel products as some of these products moved into eol 
revenue from eol products totaled million and million in the fiscal year ended september  and  respectively 
product phase outs are part of our normal course of business  and we will continue this practice in the future 
we expect revenues from eol products to decline in fiscal year however  we cannot predict the degree and or timing of the impact of product phase out on future revenues 
from time to time  upon customer request or due to a change in our product strategy  we may decide to resume producing a part we previously phased out 
we also classify our product revenues based on our three product lines i connectivity  ii ethernet switching  and iii transport processing 
product revenue by product line is as follows september  amount of product revenues amount of product revenues change change in thousands  except percentages connectivity ethernet switching transport processing product revenues the decrease in connectivity revenues is largely attributable to the broad based decline in the networking equipment market  which negatively impacted the demand for our more mature products  particularly sonet sdh based products 
the decrease in ethernet switching revenues is largely attributable to declines in our gigabit ethernet cu phys selling primarily into the enterprise market  and ethernet mac products selling into both the carrier and enterprise markets 
the decrease was partially offset by sales of our new cu phy products to the carrier market 

table of contents the decrease in transport processing revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is largely attributable to the broad based market decline for our mature sonet sdh framers and mappers  offset by increased sales of switch fabric products to customers increasing inventories of these products as they approach eol

engineering  research and development september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages engineering  research and development the decrease in r d expense for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is largely attributable to lower compensation and facility expense of million resulting from our consolidation of multiple locations and shift in activities to lower cost areas  lower mask and test wafer expense of million  and lower eda tools expense of million 
selling  general and administrative september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative the decrease in sg a expense for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is largely attributable to lower compensation related expenses of million  a million change in bad debt expense due to successful collection of million of the million of bad debts reserved in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  million in lower legal and accounting fees  and lower facility and depreciation expenses of million due to our consolidation of facilities 
partially offsetting the reductions was a million intangible asset write down expense in fiscal year 
restructuring and impairment charges september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages restructuring and impairment during fiscal year we consolidated design activities and consolidated our camarillo operations into a single facility  exiting an adjacent leased facility 
in connection with these activities we incurred approximately million of restructuring charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that it was unlikely we would be able to sublease the exited property for the remaining lease term through december therefore  we decided that we would reoccupy the exited facility upon expiration of our main camarillo facility lease in january  instead of locating to a new facility as originally planned 
accordingly  we reversed the remaining lease termination reserve of million 
interest expense  net september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages interest expense  net 
table of contents the decrease in net interest expense for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an million pay down on the senior term loan in january  the restructuring of the senior term loan on february   and the million principal payment on the term a loan in july gain on compound embedded derivative september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages gain on compound embedded derivative the gain on our compound embedded derivative related to our debentures is primarily generated by the decrease in the price of our underlying common stock during those periods 
loss on extinguishment of debt september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages loss on extinguishment of debt a loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal year was a result of the extinguishment of the senior term loan at fair value  in which we recognized a million loss for the difference between the aggregate fair values of term a and b loans plus additional amounts and fees paid to the noteholders compared to the net carrying value of the senior term loan 
income tax benefit september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues change change in thousands  except percentages income tax benefit our effective tax benefit for fiscal year was

cash increased million from operating with lower inventory levels and prepaid and other assets  partially offset by million from higher receivables 
cash also increased by million due to increased accounts payable and deferred revenue due to higher purchases from distributors  which was offset by million from lower accrued liabilities 
inventory decreased million from million at september  to million at september  due to ongoing efforts to ensure purchases align with production and efforts to manage excess inventory 
accounts payable  accrued liabilities and other liabilities increased by million from million at september  to million at september  due to the timing of payments to our vendors and other service providers 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by operating activities totaled million

in order to increase our working capital  we may seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our market risk exposure is solely a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk our term a and b loans and debentures bear fixed interest rates  and therefore  would not be subject to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in the eu and asia 
our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the united states dollar  
table of contents primarily the euro  danish kroner  taiwanese dollar  chinese renminbi and indian rupee 
we primarily incur research and development  sales and customer support and administrative expenses in these foreign currencies 
all of our sales are denominated in united states dollars  and we are therefore subject to limited foreign currency exchange rate risks as a result of commercial operations in europe and asia 
fluctuations in the united states dollar exchange rate for euro  danish kroner  taiwanese dollar  chinese renminbi  and indian rupee could result in increased or decreased costs for commercial operations in europe and asia 
had exchange rates of these foreign currencies been higher or lower relative to the united states dollar during  total r d and sg a expenses would have been approximately million higher or lower 
a relatively small amount of our monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies 
the impact on these assets and liabilities from fluctuations in related foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar would not have had a material impact on our results of operations 
we outsource our wafer manufacturing  assembly and testing  warehousing and shipping operations to third parties in foreign jurisdictions pursuant to short term contracts that allow for changes in the fees we are charged for these services 
while the expenses related to these services are denominated in united states dollars  if the value of the united states dollar decreases relative to the currencies of the countries in which such contractors operate  the prices we are charged for their services may increase 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future 
currently  we have not implemented any hedging strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates
