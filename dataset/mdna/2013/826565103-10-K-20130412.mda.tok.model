overview our goal is to be a leader in intelligent media platforms for use in home entertainment and control 
we focus on integrated system on chip  or soc  solutions that serve as the foundation for some of the world s leading consumer products  including televisions  set top boxes  and video networking products 
all of our primary products are semiconductors that are targeted toward end product manufacturers  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and original design manufacturers  or odms 
we sell our products into six primary markets which are the digital television  or dtv  market  home networking market  internet protocol television  or iptv  media processor market  home control and energy management market  prosumer and industrial audio video market  and the connected media player market 
we derive a minor portion of our revenue from other products and services  including technology licenses  software development kits  engineering support services for hardware and software  engineering development for customization of chipsets and other accessories 
our chipset products and target markets we consider all of our semiconductor products to be chipsets because each of our products is comprised of multiple semiconductors 
we believe our chipsets enable our customers to efficiently bring consumer multimedia devices to market 
we design our highly integrated products to significantly improve performance  lower power consumption and reduce cost 
we sell our chipsets into each of our six primary target markets 
for fiscal  and  we derived nearly all of our net revenue from sales of our chipset products 
our six primary target markets are the dtv market  home networking market  iptv media processor market  home control and energy management market  prosumer and industrial audio video market  and the connected media player market 
because of our focus on these target markets  we separately report revenues that we derive from sales into each of these target markets 
the dtv market consists primarily of internet enabled digital televisions or smarttv 
we serve this market primarily with our enhanced picture quality  our frame rate conversion chips  and our internet access software suite 
the iptv media processor market consists primarily of telecommunication carriers that deploy iptv set top boxes for delivering video services over a dsl network 
we serve this market primarily with our media processor products 
the home networking market consists of communication devices that use a standard protocol to connect equipment inside the home and stream ip based video and audio  voip  or data through wired or wireless connectivity 
we target the home networking market with our wired home networking controllers that are designed to provide connectivity solutions between various home entertainment products and incoming video streams 
our home control and energy management automation product line consists of our wireless z wave chipsets which consist of wireless transceiver devices along with a mesh networking protocol 
the connected media player market consists primarily of digital media adapters  or dmas  portable media devices  and wireless streaming pc to tv devices that perform playback of digital media 
we target this market with our media processor products 
the prosumer and industrial audio video market consists of studio quality audio video receivers and monitors  video conferencing  digital projectors and medical video monitors 
we target this market with our video image processor and video encoder product line 
we also sell products into other markets  such as the digital signage  high definition television  or hdtv  projection tv and pc based add in markets  which we refer to as our other market 
we derive minor revenue from sales of our products into these other markets 
characteristics of our business we do not enter into long term commitment contracts with our customers and generate substantially all of our net revenue based on customer purchase orders 
we forecast demand for our products based not only on our assessment of the requirements of our direct customers  but also on the anticipated requirements of the telecommunications carriers that our direct customers serve 
we work with both our direct customers and these carriers to address the market demands and the necessary specifications for our technologies 
however  our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our relationship with these customers or lead to excess inventory  which could negatively impact our gross margins in a particular period 
during the fiscal years  and  we recorded provisions for excess inventory of million  million and million  respectively  primarily due to the end of life of certain products and an end customer s transition to a next generation product sold by our competitors 
many of our target markets are characterized by intense price competition 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and  as a result  we expect our average selling prices to decline over time 
the willingness of customers to design our chipsets into their products depends to a significant extent upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset any declines in product selling prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher gross margins in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross margins 
we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in our average selling prices and average costs  discounts  mix of product sales  amount of license revenue and provisions for inventory excess and obsolescence 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments that affect the reported amounts and disclosures of the assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and also revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the primary areas that require significant estimates and judgments by management include  but are not limited to  revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  stock based compensation expense  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  strategic investments  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  uncertain tax positions  tax contingencies  restructuring costs  litigation and other loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the critical accounting policies as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended february   reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reclassifications certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we concluded that it was appropriate to reclassify our purchased intellectual property  or ip  that is incorporated into our products  from software  equipment and leasehold improvements to intangible assets 
the reclassification has no effect on previously reported consolidated statements of operations or accumulated deficit for any period and does not affect previously reported cash flows from operations or from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
for comparability purposes  the corresponding gross assets and accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively  have been reclassified as of january  restructuring charges during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we adopted a restructuring plan  which included targeted reductions in labor costs through headcount reduction and other related actions and targeted reductions in other operating expenses such as consulting  travel and subletting excess office space 
we also plan to migrate to lower cost manufacturing components and processes 
we expect to execute the restructuring plan in several phases 
during the third quarter of fiscal we completed the initial phase  which consisted of headcount reduction in our north american operations and the implementation of expense management measures across worldwide operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we implemented a further reduction in headcount  primarily in canada 
for fiscal  we recognized a charge of million in connection with our restructuring activities 
we anticipate we will incur additional restructuring charges in future periods as we continue to balance our current cost structure with our anticipated growth 
in addition  during the first quarter of fiscal we reduced our headcount by employees  resulting in an estimated restructuring cost of million 
derivative financial instruments we account for our financial derivatives as either assets or liabilities and carry them at fair value 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  nor do we hold or issue leveraged derivative financial instruments 
we use foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions 
unrealized gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying transactions affect earnings 
gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in current earnings 
short and long term marketable securities short term marketable securities represent highly liquid instruments with a remaining maturity date at the end of each reporting period of greater than days but less than one year and are stated at fair value 
long term marketable securities represent securities with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of acquisition 
we classify our marketable securities as available for sale because the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity 
the difference between amortized cost cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  which is recognized as an adjustment to interest income and fair value  representing unrealized holding gains or losses  are recorded separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
any gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
we monitor all of our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have a decline in fair value  we use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration of any impairment  iii the financial condition and future prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
no such impairment charges were recorded in fiscal  and accounts receivable and allowances we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot estimate whether collectability is reasonably assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we also provide allowances for bad debt and sales returns 
in establishing the allowance for bad debt  we review the customer s payment history and information regarding their credit worthiness 
in establishing the allowance for sales returns  we make estimates of potential future returns of products for which revenue has been recognized in the current period  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
in fiscal  we released million for sales returns  discounts and bad debt 
in fiscal and  we recorded provisions for sales returns  discounts and bad debt in the total amounts of million and million  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or future product returns increased  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
we evaluate our ending inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and estimated future unit sales by product as well as product purchase commitments that are not cancelable 
we develop our demand forecasts based  in part  on discussions with our customers about their forecasted supply needs 
however  our customers generally only provide us with firm purchase commitments for the month and quarter and not our entire forecasted period 
additionally  our sales and marketing personnel provide estimates of future sales to prospective customers based on actual and expected design wins 
a provision is recorded for inventory in excess of estimated future demand 
in addition  we write off inventory that is obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenue 
at the time of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  we will realize higher gross margins for those products 
inventory write downs inherently involve assumptions and judgments as to amount of future sales and selling prices 
as a result of our inventory valuation reviews  we recorded provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of approximately million  million and million to cost of revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
although we believe that the assumptions we use in estimating inventory write downs are reasonable  significant future changes in these assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
there can be no assurances that future events and changing market conditions will not result in significant inventory write downs 
warranty our products typically carry a one year limited warranty that products will be free from defects in materials and workmanship 
warranty cost is estimated at the time revenue is recognized  based on historical activity and additionally for any specific known product warranty issues 
accrued warranty cost includes hardware repair and or replacement and software support costs and is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  product recalls  repair or replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
in that event  our product gross margins would be reduced 
software  equipment and leasehold improvements software  equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization for software  equipment and leasehold improvements is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the assets one to five years or the remaining lease term if shorter 
any allowance for leasehold improvements received from the landlord for improvements to our facilities is amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the remaining lease term or the useful life of the leasehold improvements 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
intangible assets the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization 
intangible assets include those acquired through business combinations and intellectual property that we purchase for incorporation into our product designs 
we begin amortizing such intellectual property at the time that we begin shipment of the associated products into which it is incorporated 
we amortize the intellectual property over the estimated useful life of the associated products  generally two to three years 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
other intangible assets primarily represent purchased developed technology  customer relationships  trademarks  non compete agreements  purchased ip and ip r d 
we currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from two to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used or  if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  using a straight line amortization method 
we capitalize ip r d projects acquired as part of a business combination and upon completion of each project  ip r d assets are reclassified to developed technology and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to finite lived intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the last day of our fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we conduct a two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the first step requires identifying the reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
we have identified that we operate one reporting unit and the fair value of our operating unit is determined to be equal to our market capitalization as determined through quoted market prices  adjusted for a reasonable control premium 
we estimate the control premium based on a review of acquisitions of comparable semiconductor companies that were completed during the last four years 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the amount  by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  is recognized as an impairment loss 
during development  ip r d is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of ip r d is less than its carrying amount  and if so  we conduct a quantitative impairment test 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value to its carrying amount 
if the carrying value exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
once an ip r d project is complete  it becomes a definite lived intangible asset and is evaluated for impairment in accordance with our policy for long lived assets 
we test long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets other than goodwill and ip r d for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a change in technology  indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  we determine whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is recoverable  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
if an asset is not recoverable  we record an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we primarily use the income valuation approach to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and purchased intangible assets 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include forecasts of revenue and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and a determination of appropriate market comparable 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at that time  however  actual future results may differ from those estimates 
future competitive  market and economic conditions could negatively impact key assumptions including our market capitalization  actual control premiums or the carrying value of our net assets  which could require us to realize an additional impairment 
long term investments investments in private equity securities of less than owned companies are accounted for using the cost method unless we can exercise significant influence or the investee is economically dependent upon us  in which case the equity method is used 
we evaluate our long term investments for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
assets held for sale assets are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use 
the assets are classified as assets to be disposed of by sale when the following conditions have been met management has approved the plan to sell  assets are available for immediate sale  assets are actively being marketed  sale is probable within one year  price is reasonable in the market and it is unlikely that there will be significant changes in the assets to be sold or a withdrawal to the plan to sell 
assets classified as held for sale  which include software licenses design tools and computer and testing equipment  are reported as current assets at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and depreciation is not charged on long lived assets classified as held for sale 
balance of assets held for sale at february  and january  was million and zero  respectively  and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from product sales 
our products  which we refer to as chipsets  consist of highly integrated semiconductors and embedded software that enables real time processing of digital video and audio content  which we refer to as real time software 
we do not deliver software as a separate product in connection with product sales 
we recognize revenue for product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
we record reductions of revenue for estimated product returns in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  specific criteria included in the agreements  and other factors known at the time 
we accrue of potential returns at the time of sale when there is not sufficient historical sales data and recognize revenue when the right of return expires 
in addition  we also derive a portion of our net revenue from licensing the right to use our intellectual property from our home control and energy management market 
license fees are recognized over the term specified 
we recognize licensing revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time our technology is made available to the customer 
licensing revenue for fiscal was million 
licensing revenue for fiscal was less than million and zero for fiscal we defer revenue when payments are received from customers in advance of revenue recognition 
deferred revenue  consisting principally of license fees collected in advance  at february  and january  was million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts reported for income tax purposes  and any operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for future taxable amounts and deferred tax assets are recognized for future deductions  net of any valuation allowance  to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are considered more likely than not to be realized 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors based on their estimated fair values measured on the date of grant 
stock option awards are measured using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate forfeitures  based on historical experience  at the time of grant and revise our estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
results of operations the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of operations and sets forth our historical operating results as a percentage of net revenue for each of the fiscal years indicated in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended february  of net revenue january  of net revenue january  of net revenue net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs impairment of goodwill impairment of acquired intangible assets impairment of ip and design tools gain on acquisition total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net impairment of investment income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss net revenue our net revenue for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal net revenue benefited million from the addition of the dtv product line  resulting from our acquisition of certain assets from trident microsystems inc  or trident  in the second quarter of fiscal excluding dtv  our net revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal this net revenue decrease was primarily due to a change in product mix to our lower average selling price  or asp  products resulting in a decline in asp per chipset  partially offset by an increase in units shipped 
the change in product mix  excluding dtv  was primarily due to the significant decrease in revenue in our iptv and connected media player cmp markets  only partially offset by the increase in revenue of our lower asp home networking market and to a lessor extent our home control and energy management market 
additionally  asps continued to decline in all of our target markets year over year  due to competitive pressures 
the increase in units shipped was comprised primarily of a increase for our home networking products and a increase for our home control and energy management products  primarily due to increased deployments of our hpna product line and ongoing market expansion for our z wave solution 
the decrease in units shipped in our other markets was due to a combination of new product transition timing and loss of market share 
net revenues in our other market during fiscal include technology license revenue of million 
technology license revenue was less than million in fiscal we expect our revenue to fluctuate in future periods based on a shift in market factors and product mix 
our net revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in units shipped and a decline in asp 
the decrease in units shipped was comprised primarily of a decline for our media processor products and a decline for our home networking products 
the decrease in asps was primarily due to the increase  as a percentage of net revenue  of sales of our home networking and home control and energy management products and newer generation media processor products compared to sales of our older generation media processor products because asps for our home networking and home control and energy management products and lower priced newer generation media processor products are lower than our older generation media processor products 
the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to competitive factors  the timing of new product introductions at telecommunications service providers and other consumer electronics companies and inventory levels at contract manufacturers who manufacture equipment incorporating our products 
net revenue by target market we sell our products into six primary target markets  which are the dtv market  home networking market  iptv media processor market  home control and energy management market  prosumer and industrial audio video market  and connected media player market 
we also have license revenue and sell a small amount of our chipsets into other markets  such as the digital signage  projection tv and pc based add in markets  which we refer to as our other market 
the following table sets forth our net revenue by target market and the percentage of net revenue represented by our product sales to each target market in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended february  of net revenue january  of net revenue january  of net revenue dtv home networking iptv media processor home control and energy management prosumer and industrial audio video connected media player license and other net revenue dtv market our acquisition of the dtv assets from trident microsystems in the second quarter of fiscal allowed us to expand our participation in the dtv market  which previously had not been significant and had been included in the license and other category 
we believe dtv products complement our existing iptv media processor and connected media player products  which will provide substantial research and development leverage and improved operating scale to augment our ability to develop innovative solutions for the anticipated convergence of ip video delivery across any device within the home networking market 
net revenue from sales of our products into the dtv market was million or of total net revenue 
we expect that our dtv business may experience some seasonality common to consumer electronics markets as trident typically experienced slower dtv sales in the first quarter of the calendar year and strongest dtv sales in the third calendar quarter 
we expect our net revenue from the dtv market to continue to be a significant percentage of net revenue but will fluctuate in future periods as we develop and introduce new products for this market 
home networking market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the home networking market increased million  or  compared to fiscal excluding dtv net revenue  our net revenue from the home networking market as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal was  an increase of percentage points  compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue was primarily the result of a higher volume of units shipped due to our expansion into south america and continued growth in asia 
we expect our net revenue from the home networking market to fluctuate in future periods based on changes in inventory levels at contract manufacturers who manufacture equipment incorporating our products for deployment by telecommunication providers 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the home networking market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal as a result of decreases in asp and units shipped 
the decrease in asp was primarily the result of transitions to our newer generation lower asp products and also certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our older generation products 
the decrease in units shipped was the result of a decrease in demand from contract manufacturers who manufacture equipment incorporating our products for deployment by telecommunication providers due to their management of their inventory levels 
iptv media processor market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the iptv media processor market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline of in units shipped as a result of reduced demand for our chipsets in the iptv media processor market as a result of competitive factors in connection with product transitions at telecommunications service providers to the next generation iptv media processor solutions 
excluding dtv net revenue  our net revenue from the iptv media processor market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the decrease in demand for our chipsets in the iptv media processor market 
demand decreased during fiscal due to a combination of customer product transitions and market share loss in both set top box and connected media player segments 
we expect our net revenue from the iptv media processor market to fluctuate in future periods as this net revenue is dependent on design wins of our newer and future generations of our technology with iptv service providers 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the iptv media processor market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline of in units shipped as a result of reduced demand for our chipsets in the iptv media processor market as a result of competitive factors in connection with product transitions at telecommunications service providers to the next generation iptv media processor solutions 
our net revenue from the iptv media processor market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the decrease in demand for our chipsets in the iptv media processor market 
home control and energy management market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the home control and energy management market increased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily in north america 
excluding dtv net revenue  our net revenue from the home control and energy management market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal was an increase of percentage points compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue was primarily the result of a increase in unit shipments partially offset by slightly lower asps 
we expect our net revenue from the home control and energy management market to continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
net revenue from our home control and energy management market was not significant in fiscal prosumer and industrial audio video market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the prosumer and industrial audio video market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal the overall decrease was attributable to a decrease in asp on relatively flat units shipped 
units shipped decreased in asia due to lower demand from our customers located in asia who manufacture high end audio video prosumer electronics and video conferencing products 
this decrease was offset by higher quantities of units shipped at lower asps in north america due to a shift in product mix to our lower asp next generation products 
excluding dtv net revenue  our net revenue from sales into the prosumer and industrial audio video market as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal was unchanged at compared to fiscal we expect our net revenue from the prosumer and industrial audio video market to fluctuate based on our ability to obtain design wins in our customers newer generation products  broad economic trends affecting business spending on video conferencing and high end audio video products and also discretionary consumer spending 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the prosumer and industrial audio video market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease was attributable to both a decrease in asp and a decrease in units shipped 
the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to lower demand from our customers who manufacture high end audio video prosumer electronics and video conferencing products 
the decrease in asp was primarily due to a change in customer mix 
our net revenue from sales into the prosumer and industrial audio video market as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal connected media player market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the connected media player market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal  as a result of decreases of in units shipped and in asp  primarily in asia 
excluding dtv net revenue  our net revenue from the connected media player market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal decreased percentage points compared to fiscal the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to competitive factors 
the decrease in asp was primarily due to certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our older generation products and also transitions to our newer generation lower asp products 
we expect our net revenue from the connected media player market to fluctuate in future periods primarily due to the timing and nature of new product introductions by consumer electronics companies that incorporate our products and their transition to our newer generation products 
additionally  due to decreases in the asps of our newer generation products relative to our older generation products  we must increase unit shipments of our products substantially in order to increase our net revenue 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the connected media player market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal  as a result of decreases of in units shipped and in asp 
the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to competitive factors 
the decrease in asp was primarily due to certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our older generation products and also transitions to our newer generation lower asp products 
our net revenue from the connected media player market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the overall decrease in units shipped into the iptv media processor market 
license and other markets our other markets consist of technology license revenue  pc add in boards  development contracts  services and other ancillary markets 
the net revenue derived from our other markets was not a significant portion of our total net revenue 
the increase in net revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of million of technology license revenue in fiscal net revenue by product group our primary product group consists of our chipsets 
our chipsets are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume designer and manufacturer customers building products for the dtv  iptv media processor  home networking  home control and energy management  connected media player  and prosumer and industrial audio video consumer electronic markets 
sales of our chipsets accounted for approximately  and of our net revenue for fiscal  and  respectively

for fiscal and  our net revenue generated outside north america was and of our net revenue  respectively 
the overall trend has been for companies located in north america who incorporate our products into their finished products to move their production orders to large designers and manufacturers located in the asia region 
we expect our net revenue from north america in any given year to fluctuate depending on whether our customers place their orders locally or through overseas manufacturers who incorporate our products into their finished products 
our net revenue from north america decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower demand in north america for our chipset solutions across all of our target markets 
for fiscal and  our net revenue generated outside north america was of our net revenue for both periods

gross profit and gross margin the following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin in thousands  except percentages for fiscal years ended february  change january  change january  gross profit gross margin the million  or  increase in gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the addition of the dtv product line  resulting from our acquisition of certain assets from trident in the second quarter of fiscal  which generated million of our gross profit for fiscal excluding dtv  our gross profit decreased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower asps from pricing pressure on declining volume products  partially offset by an increase in units shipped  primarily in home networking  plus license revenue 
our gross margin declined percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the addition of the lower margin dtv product line which reduced overall gross margin by percentage points 
excluding dtv  our gross margin was  an increase of percentage points compared to fiscal this increase was primarily a result of an increase in the volume of our home networking products with reduced average cost per unit  or acu  the license revenue we recognized in fiscal with no corresponding license revenue in fiscal and lower fixed costs absorbed in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in acu was primarily due to cost reduction efforts to offset declines in asp and product mix  and was partially offset by a decreased percentage of fixed costs per unit due to an increase in units shipped 
excluding dtv shipments  units shipped increased in fiscal compared to fiscal our fixed costs include items such as depreciation and amortization and compensation costs for operations 
the decrease in gross margin primarily due to the dtv product mix was partially offset by a reduction of million in the amount of inventory write downs we had in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a million provision for excess inventory primarily in connection with the end of life of certain products 
during fiscal  and we benefited from the sale of approximately million  million and million  respectively  of inventory that had been previously written down 
our gross profit decreased million and our gross margin decreased by percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases were primarily due to a decline in our asp and decrease in units shipped  which were partially offset by an decline in acu 
the decrease in asp was primarily due to the increase  as a percentage of total net revenue  of sales of our home networking and home control and energy management automation products and our new generation media processor products compared to sales of our older generation media processor products which had higher asps 
the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to competitive factors and the timing of new product introductions at telecommunications service providers and other consumer electronics companies 
the decrease in acu was primarily due to the same reasons noted for our asp decline and was partially offset by an increased percentage of fixed costs per unit due to the decrease in units shipped 
fixed costs include such items as depreciation and amortization and compensation costs for operations 
the decrease in gross profit was also impacted by a million provision recorded for excess inventory primarily in connection with our die bank of selected soc devices during fiscal compared to million recorded in fiscal the provisions for these soc devices were triggered by customer notifications of a product transition taking place 
during fiscal  we benefited from the sale of approximately million of inventory that had been previously written down

however  our selling expenses can fluctuate on a quarterly basis with changes in revenue and our marketing expenses can increase in a quarter due to the timing of marketing programs and events 
for fiscal  compared to fiscal  our sales and marketing expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in compensation and benefits due to an increase in headcount to support new product introduction and promotion as well as salary increases for existing employees 
depreciation and amortization decreased primarily due to lower amortization of acquired intangible assets as a result of related acquired intangible assets impairment charges recorded in our third quarter of fiscal trade shows  travel and entertainment expenses increased primarily due to increased participation in trade shows to introduce and promote our new products 
external commissions decreased due to lower net revenue for our products sold through external sales representatives

for fiscal  we expect our general and administrative expense to decrease in dollars and as a percentage of our net revenue compared to fiscal  as a result of our restructuring plan 
however  fluctuations in professional services can cause an increase in any particular quarter 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  compensation and benefits increased due to an overall increase in headcount and salary increases 
outside services decreased due to a reduction in spending for recruiting 
facilities and it infrastructure costs increased due to increased investments to update and support our worldwide systems and to support the increased headcount 
restructuring costs as a result of the challenging competitive environment and decrease in margin of certain products  during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal we adopted company wide cost saving measures in response to these factors  resulting in the termination of a total of employees to be effective through april   the early termination of certain office space lease agreements  impairment of certain long lived assets and the cancellation of certain engineering development projects 
the purpose of this restructuring program was to realign resources with the then current business outlook and to lower our cost structure 
as a result of the restructuring program  we recognized total restructuring costs of million in fiscal the charges include the impairment charge of long lived assets with a carrying amount of million related to abandoned facilities identified as part of the restructuring plan 
in addition  during the first quarter of fiscal we reduced our headcount by employees  resulting in an estimated restructuring cost of million

the results of this review indicated that certain purchased ip incorporated into discontinued products and products in development were impaired  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge for purchased ip of million 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge for certain software  equipment and leasehold improvements and prepaid licenses associated with such discontinued products of million and million  respectively 
the impairment related to developed products of million was recorded in cost of revenue and the impairment related to products in development of million was recorded in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we performed an impairment review and concluded that the carrying value of our goodwill and acquired ip r d was fully impaired  which resulted in an impairment charge of million and million  respectively  in fiscal subsequent to january   we have not capitalized any goodwill or ip r d 
additionally  we performed an impairment review of our intangible assets  other than goodwill and ip r d  and concluded that two of our intangible asset groups  consisting primarily of certain developed technology and customer relationship intangibles related to our coppergate acquisition  were not fully recoverable  resulting in an impairment charge of million in fiscal we classify our expense from the amortization of acquired developed technology and purchased ip for deployed products of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  as cost of revenue

the amortization period is based on the expected vesting term of the awards 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to stock options that became fully vested during the year  partially offset by an increase in awards for newly hired and existing employees compared to the prior fiscal year 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with any acquisitions 
gain on acquisition on may   we completed our acquisition of certain assets from trident microsystems  inc and certain of its subsidiaries collectively referred to as trident used in or related to trident s digital television and pc television businesses the dtv business for a purchase price of million  subject to adjustments based on the closing asset balance of the dtv business  plus the assumption of certain employee related liabilities pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated march  the purchase agreement 
trident filed for voluntarily petition under chapter bankruptcy on january  in april  we were selected as the successful bidder to acquire trident s dtv business 
the purchase price of the trident acquisition was paid in cash 
in connection with the trident acquisition  we acquired all of trident s dtv business products  certain licensed intellectual property rights  specified tangible assets and other assets specified in the purchase agreement 
we also acquired the right to use certain facilities of trident and hired approximately employees whose services are used in the dtv business 
the addition of trident industry leading dtv media processor system on a chip  or soc  products for next generation internet enabled digital televisions is expected to significantly expand our served available market 
dtv products complement our existing iptv set top box and connected media player soc solutions and will augment our ability to develop innovative solutions for the anticipated convergence of ip video delivery across any device within the home 
the total purchase price of million was allocated to the net tangible and identified intangible assets based upon fair values as of may   closing date

our fiscal effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily because our net loss for fiscal was either in a foreign tax jurisdiction with a zero tax rate where no tax benefit could be realized or in jurisdictions where the losses were not deductible for tax purposes 
our fiscal effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the foreign tax differential benefit resulting from the nature of our international operations of million and the federal research and development tax credits of million that became available during the last quarter of the fiscal year 
we benefit from tax incentives granted by local tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the economic development board of singapore granted development and expansion incentives to our wholly owned subsidiary in singapore in for a period of four years ended march  contingent on meeting specified requirements 
absent such tax incentives  the corporate income tax rate in singapore would have been from fiscal to fiscal the impact of this tax holiday was to increase net income by approximately million or per diluted share in fiscal  million or per diluted share in fiscal and million or per diluted share in fiscal to date we have not complied with all of the operating conditions required by the tax incentives  and we could lose the related tax benefits prospectively and could be required to refund potentially material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive  subject to negotiation with the singapore authorities

during  accounts receivable and inventory decreased as a result of lower revenue which resulted in lower billings to customers and lower inventory purchases from suppliers 
inventory also decreased due to the million provision for excess inventory primarily as a result of product transitions by customers 
our annual average day s sales outstanding increased to days at january  compared to days at january   primarily due to timing of shipments and customer mix 
accounts payable decreased primarily due to the timing of payment for inventory purchases 
accrued liabilities decreased primarily due to a decrease of million in accrued rebates as a result of payments made and lower revenue which led to less new rebate accruals  and a decrease of million as a result of payouts of the coppergate acquisition contingent bonus pool

during  the increase in inventory was the result of an increase in our die bank and finished goods as a result of an easing in supply of wafers and an increase in our die bank for our newer generation products to meet forecasted demand 
despite the increase in inventory  our annualized rate of inventory turns increased to times per year for fiscal compared to times per year for fiscal as a result of the overall increase in shipments in fiscal the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payment for inventory 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of decreased product shipments and timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal our annual average day s sales outstanding increased to days at january  compared to days at january   primarily due to timing of shipments and customer mix 
cash flows from our operating activities will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow net revenues while reducing our costs through our restructuring efforts and managing the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us  the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products

while we generated cash from operations for fiscal  we consumed cash in operations during fiscal and and it is possible that our operations will consume additional cash in future periods 
based on our current anticipated cash needs  we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements  obligations  capital expenditures  strategic investments and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
during fiscal  we adopted a restructuring plan  which included targeted reductions in labor costs through headcount reduction and other related actions and targeted reductions in other operating expenses such as consulting  travel and subletting excess office space 
we also plan to migrate to lower cost manufacturing components and processes 
we expect to execute the restructuring plan in several phases 
during fiscal we executed the first phase 
we anticipate we will reduce cash consumed by operations and we will likely incur additional restructuring costs in future periods as we continue to implement our plan 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance strategic investments or other activities during or beyond the next months and our future capital requirements may vary significantly from those currently planned 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable security balances will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow revenue  the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us and the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
from time to time  we may also increase our long term investments  which will cause our marketable securities balances to decrease 
as of february   million of the million of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
approximately million of these funds are directly or indirectly owed to the us based parent organization by our foreign subsidiaries to settle intercompany loans 
if the remaining amount of million of these funds is needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
we are not aware of any trends  demands or uncertainties as a result of this policy that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business  as a whole or that may be relevant to our financial flexibility 
our marketable securities primarily include corporate commercial paper  corporate bonds  money market funds  municipal bonds and notes  fixed income mutual funds and us agency discount notes 
we monitor all of our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have had a decline in fair value  we may need to use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration of any impairment  iii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we would recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
contractual obligations and commitments we generally do not have guaranteed price or quantity commitments from any of our suppliers 
additionally  we generally acquire products for sale to our customers based on purchase orders received as well as forecasts from such customers 
purchase orders with delivery dates greater than twelve weeks are typically cancelable without penalty to our customers 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase semiconductor wafers  other materials and finished goods from our suppliers on an eight to sixteen week lead time basis 
the following table sets forth the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of february  in thousands payments due by period fiscal fiscal fiscal total operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we have investments in privately held companies  which we review annually to determine if they should be accounted for as variable interest entities 
for the year ended february   we evaluated our investments in these privately held companies and concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest from investment entities 
as a result  we account for these investments on a cost basis and do not consolidate the activity of these investee entities 
certain events can require a reassessment of our investments in privately held companies to determine if they meet the criteria for variable interest entities and to determine which stakeholders in such entities will be the primary beneficiary 
in the event of a reassessment  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities in future periods 
as of february   we had no off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our operations and financial condition 
to mitigate some of the foreign currency exchange rate risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity as of february  and january   we held approximately million and million  respectively  of cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities 
if short term interest rates were to decrease  the decreased interest income associated with these cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would not have a significant impact on our net income loss and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity we transact our revenue in us dollars 
the us dollar is our reporting currency 
the us dollar is our functional currency except for our subsidiaries in canada  china  denmark  france  japan  taiwan and vietnam where the canadian dollar  chinese yuan  danish krone  euro  japanese yen  taiwanese dollar and vietnamese dong are the functional currencies  respectively 
additionally  significant portions of our israel subsidiary s expenses are payroll related and are denominated in israeli shekels 
this foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the us dollar against the israeli shekel 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against the israeli shekel  our israeli subsidiary will experience a negative impact on its results of operations 
as of february   with the exception of our israel operation  we had not entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and inter company balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
for our israel operation  we do hedge portions of our forecasted expenses that are denominated in the israeli shekel with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as of february   we had foreign exchange contracts with notional values of approximately million that mature on or before december  these hedges of cash flow exposures will only mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange exposure 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rates at february   the notional value of our derivative instruments would decline and we would record a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
we maintain certain cash balances denominated in the canadian dollar  chinese yuan  danish krone  euro  japanese yen  hong kong dollar  israeli shekel  singapore dollar  taiwanese dollar and vietnamese dong 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rates at february   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline and we would record a charge of approximately million
