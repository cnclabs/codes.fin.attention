item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
this md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements notes 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december fiscal years  and each consisted of weeks and ended on december   december  and january   respectively 
all references to years in this md a represent fiscal years unless otherwise noted 
management overview our revenues are primarily derived by selling  implementing and supporting software solutions  clinical content  hardware  devices and services that give health care providers secure access to clinical  administrative and financial data in real time  allowing them to improve quality  safety and efficiency in the delivery of health care 
our fundamental strategy centers on creating organic growth by investing in research and development r d to create solutions and services for the health care industry 
this strategy has driven strong growth over the long term  as reflected in five and ten year compound annual revenue growth rates of or more 
this growth has also created an important strategic footprint in health care  with cerner solutions licensed by approximately  facilities around the world  including more than  hospitals   physician practices   physicians  ambulatory facilities  such as laboratories  ambulatory centers  behavioral health centers  cardiac facilities  radiology clinics and surgery centers  home health facilities  employer sites and  retail pharmacies 
selling additional solutions back into this client base is an important element of our future revenue growth 
we are also focused on driving growth through market share expansion by strategically aligning with health care providers that have not yet selected a supplier and by displacing competitors in health care settings that are looking to replace their current supplier 
we expect to drive growth through new initiatives and services that reflect our ongoing ability to innovate and expand our reach into health care 
examples of these include our careaware health care device architecture and devices  employer services  cerner itworks services  cerner revworks services  and solutions on our healthe intent platform 
finally  we believe there is significant opportunity for growth outside of the united states  with many non us markets focused on hcit as part of their strategy to improve the quality and lower the cost of health care 
beyond our strategy for driving revenue growth  we are also focused on earnings growth 
similar to our history of growing revenue  our net earnings have increased at compound annual rates of more than over the most recent five and ten year periods 
we expect to drive continued earnings growth through ongoing revenue growth coupled with margin expansion  which we expect to achieve through efficiencies in our implementation and operational processes and by leveraging r d investments and controlling general and administrative expenses 
we are also focused on continuing to deliver strong levels of cash flow  which we expect to do by continuing to grow earnings and prudently managing capital expenditures 
results overview the company delivered strong levels of bookings  revenues  earnings and cash flows in new business bookings revenue in  which reflects the value of executed contracts for software  hardware  professional services and managed services  was billion  which is an increase of compared to billion in our revenues increased to billion compared to billion in the year over year increase in revenue reflects improved economic conditions  ongoing demand related to the hitech act  and increased contributions form new initiatives  such as device resale  cerner itworks and cerner revworks 
our net earnings increased to million compared to million in diluted earnings per share increased to compared to in the and net earnings and diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of stock based compensation expense 
the effect of these expenses reduced the net earnings and diluted earnings per share by million and  and the earnings and diluted earnings per share by million and  respectively 
the growth in net earnings and diluted earnings per share was driven primarily by strong revenue growth and continued progress with our margin expansion initiatives  including efficiencies in our implementation and operational 
table of contents processes  leveraging r d investments and controlling general and administrative expenses 
our full year operating margin of reflects an increase of basis points compared to  which was driven by strong margin expansion in our core business that was somewhat offset by record levels of lower margin technology resale 
we had cash collections of receivables of billion in compared to billion in days sales outstanding was days for the fourth quarter compared to days for the third quarter and days for the fourth quarter 
operating cash flows for were strong at million compared to million in health care information technology market outlook we have provided a detailed assessment of the health care information technology market under health care and health care it industry in part i  item business

support and maintenance revenues increased to million in compared to million during the same period in this increase was attributable to continued success at selling cerner millennium applications and implementing them at client sites 
we expect that support and maintenance revenues will continue to grow as the base of installed cerner millennium systems grows 

table of contents services revenue  which includes professional services  excluding installation  and managed services  increased to billion in from billion for the same period in this increase was driven by growth in cernerworks managed services as a result of continued demand for our hosting services and an increase in professional services due to increased implementation activities and growth in cerner itworks services 
contract backlog  which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue  increased in when compared to this increase was driven by growth in new business bookings during the past four quarters  including continued strong levels of managed services and cerner itworks services bookings that typically have longer contract terms 
a summary of total backlog at the end of and follows in thousands contract backlog support and maintenance backlog total backlog costs of revenue cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues was in  compared to in the same period of the higher cost of revenues as a percent of revenue was driven by a higher mix of technology resale  which carries a higher cost of revenue 
cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense  sales commissions  third party consulting services and subscription content and computer hardware  devices and sublicensed software purchased from manufacturers for delivery to clients 
it also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers 
such costs  as a percent of revenues  typically have varied as the mix of revenue software  hardware  devices  maintenance  support  services and reimbursed travel carrying different margin rates changes from period to period 
cost of revenues does not include the costs of our client service personnel who are responsible for delivering our service offerings 
such costs are included in sales and client service expense 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased to billion in  compared with billion in sales and client service expenses as a percent of total revenues were in  compared to in the same period of these expenses increased to billion in  from billion in the same period of sales and client service expenses include salaries of sales and client service personnel  depreciation and other expenses associated with our cernerworks managed service business  communications expenses  unreimbursed travel expenses  expense for share based payments  sales and marketing salaries and trade show and advertising costs 
the decrease as a percent of revenue reflects ongoing efficiencies in our implementation and operational processes 

table of contents software development expenses as a percent of revenue were in  compared to in expenditures for software development reflect ongoing development and enhancement of the cerner millennium platform  including investments in the next evolution of cerner millennium  millennium  which leverages the cloud and enables greater mobility 
the reduction as a percentage of revenue reflects our efforts to control spending relative to revenue growth 
because of the strong platform we have built  we are able to continue advancing our solutions and investing in new solutions without large increases in spending 
expense was also limited by a higher percentage of our software development investments being capitalized  which we expect to continue  as a higher percent of our development initiatives are focused on new functionality versus maintenance 
a summary of our total software development expense in and is as follows for the years ended in thousands software development costs capitalized software costs capitalized costs related to share based payments amortization of capitalized software costs total software development expense general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues were in  compared to in these expenses increased to million in  from million for the same period in general and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate  financial and administrative staffs  utilities  communications expenses  professional fees  transaction gains or losses on foreign currency and expense for share based payments 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase in corporate personnel costs  as we have continued to increase such personnel to support our overall revenue growth 
non operating items interest income increased to million in from million in due primarily to growth in investments 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in due primarily to payments on our long term debt  offset by increased capital lease obligations 
other income in also includes a million gain recognized on the disposition of one of our cost method investments 
our effective tax rate decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to an increase in net favorable permanent differences  along with a favorable adjustment to our unrecognized tax benefits  partially offset by the expiration of the research and development tax credit on december  we do not expect the favorable impact of permanent differences to be as significant in we also do not expect any significant favorable adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits in refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our effective tax rate 
in january  the american taxpayer relief act of act became law 
the act reinstates the research and development tax credit retroactively from january  to december  in the first quarter of  we will recognize the research and development tax credit related to as a favorable discrete item 
research and development tax credits generated in will be recognized pro rata over that year as a component of the overall effective tax rate

other  net these expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased costs in software development  increased corporate and development personnel costs  increased stock compensation costs  and growth in other professional services 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is influenced by many factors  including the amount and timing of our revenues  our cash collections from our clients and the amount we invest in software development  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents  which consist of money market funds and time deposits 
table of contents with original maturities of less than days  and short term investments 
at the end of  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at the end of approximately of our aggregate cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december   were held outside of the united states 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign operations  however  should the earnings of our foreign operations be repatriated  we would accrue and pay tax on such earnings  which may be material 
additionally  we maintain a million multi year revolving credit facility  which expires in february the facility provides an unsecured revolving line of credit for working capital purposes  along with a letter of credit facility 
interest is payable at a rate based on prime  libor  or the us federal funds rate  plus a spread that varies depending on the leverage ratios maintained 
the agreement provides certain restrictions on our ability to borrow  incur liens  sell assets and pay dividends and contains certain cash flow and liquidity covenants 
as of the end of  we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
as of the end of  we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement  however  we had million of outstanding letters of credit  which reduced our available borrowing capacity to million 
we believe that our present cash position  together with cash generated from operations  short term investments and  if necessary  our available line of credit  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during the following table summarizes our cash flows in  and for the years ended in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash total change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period free cash flow non gaap cash from operating activities for the years ended in thousands cash collections from clients cash paid to employees and suppliers and other cash paid for interest cash paid for taxes  net of refund total cash from operations cash flow from operations increased million in compared to and million in compared to due primarily to the increase in cash impacting earnings  along with cash provided by working capital changes 
during  and  we received total client cash collections of billion  billion and billion  respectively  of which  and  respectively  were received from third party client financing arrangements and non recourse payment assignments 
days sales outstanding was days in the fourth quarter of  days in the third quarter of and days in the fourth quarter of revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements represent recurring cash flows 
support and maintenance revenues increased in and in we expect these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed cerner millennium systems grows 
cash from investing activities 
table of contents for the years ended in thousands capital purchases capitalized software development costs purchases of investments  net of sales and maturities other  net total cash flows from investing activities cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of capital spending and our short term investment activities 
capital spending consists of capitalized equipment purchases primarily to support growth in our cernerworks managed services business  building and improvement purchases to support our facilities requirements and capitalized spending to support our ongoing software development initiatives 
capital spending is expected to increase in  primarily due to capital purchases associated with new office space and spending related to software development initiatives  however  we still expect strong levels of free cash flow 
short term investment activity consists of the investment of cash generated by our business in excess of what is necessary to fund operations 
we expect to continue such short term investment activity in  as we expect strong levels of cash flow 
during  we completed our acquisition of anasazi software  inc for million  net of cash acquired 
during  we completed our acquisitions of resource systems  inc and clairvia  inc 
for approximately million and million  net of cash acquired  respectively 
during  we completed our acquisition of imc health care  inc for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
we expect to continue seeking and completing strategic business acquisitions that are complementary to our business 
cash from financing activities for the years ended in thousands repayment of long term debt and capital lease obligations cash from option exercises including excess tax benefits other  net total cash flows from financing activities cash inflows from stock option exercises are dependent on a number of factors  including the price of our common stock  grant activity under our stock option and equity plans  and overall market volatility 
we expect cash inflows from stock option exercises to continue in based on the number of exercisable options at the end of and our current stock price 
free cash flow for the years ended in thousands cash flows from operating activities gaap capital purchases capitalized software development costs free cash flow non gaap free cash flow increased million from to and million from to  which we believe reflects continued strength in our earnings 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure used by management along with gaap results to analyze our earnings quality and overall cash generation of the business 
the presentation of free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation  nor as a substitute for  or superior to  gaap results and investors should be aware that non gaap measures have inherent limitations and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
free cash flow may also be different from similar non gaap financial measures used by other companies and may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
we believe free cash flow is important to enable investors to better understand 
table of contents and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allows for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial  operational and economic performance  because free cash flow takes into account the capital expenditures necessary to operate our business 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table represents a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of  except short term purchase order commitments arising in the ordinary course of business

refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the construction 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k 
the effects of inflation on our business during  and were insignificant 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving our judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  software development  potential impairments of goodwill  and income taxes 
these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this md a 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue within our multiple element arrangements  including software and software related services  using the residual method 
key factors in our revenue recognition model are our assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of our software  whereas implementation services are not  and the length of time it takes for us to achieve the delivery and installation milestones for our licensed software 
if our business model were to change such that implementation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of our software  the period of time over which our licensed software revenue would be recognized would lengthen 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of our licensed software over two key milestones  delivery and installation  based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation 
generally  both milestones are achieved in the quarter the contracts are executed 
if the period of time to achieve our delivery and installation milestones for our licensed software were to lengthen  our milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for our licensed software could materially change 

table of contents we also recognize revenue for certain projects using the percentage of completion method 
our revenue recognition is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the direct labor hours to complete a project which generally can span several years 
we utilize our historical project experience and detailed planning process as a basis for our future estimates to complete current projects 
significant delays in completion of the projects  unforeseen cost increases or penalties could result in significant reductions to revenue and margins on these contracts 
the actual project results can be significantly different from the estimated results 
when adjustments are identified near or at the end of a project  the full impact of the change in estimate is recognized in that period 
this can result in a material impact on our results for a single reporting period 
software development costs costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design  which is when we determine that technological feasibility has been established 
thereafter  all software development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are available for general release  and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
because the development of projected net future revenues related to our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates  a significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the recovery of our capitalized software development costs 
we historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in computing the net realizable value of our software solutions and the difference between the net realizable value and the unamortized cost has grown over the past three years 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
if we missed our estimates of net future revenues by  the amount of our capitalized software development costs would not be impaired 
capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution 
we are amortizing capitalized costs over five years 
the five year period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized is an estimate based upon our forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs 
historically  use of our software programs by our clients has exceeded five years and is capable of being used a decade or more 
we expect that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the health care industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the hcit market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit  where it is subject to an annual impairment assessment 
we assess goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of each fiscal year and evaluate impairment indicators at each quarter end 
we assessed our goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of and and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
the assessment consisted of a qualitative analysis in accordance with new guidance effective in the assessment consisted of a quantitative analysis  in which the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by a significant margin 
we used a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing level inputs  to determine the fair value of the reporting units in goodwill amounted to million and million at the end of and  respectively 
if future anticipated cash flows from our reporting units that recognized goodwill do not materialize as expected  our goodwill could be impaired  which could result in significant charges to earnings 
income taxes we make a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the appropriate amount of expense to record for income taxes 
these assumptions and estimates consider the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate as well as current tax regulations 
accruals are established for estimates of tax effects for certain transactions  business structures and future projected profitability of our businesses based on our interpretation of existing facts and circumstances 
if these assumptions and estimates were to change as a result of new evidence or changes in circumstances  the change in estimate could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our 
table of contents board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure contained herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use a foreign currency denominated debt instrument to reduce our foreign currency exchange rate exposure in the uk as of the end of  we designated all of our great britain pound gbp denominated long term debt million gbp as a net investment hedge of our uk operations 
because the borrowing is denominated in pounds  we are exposed to movements in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar usd and the gpb 
we estimate that a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the usd and gbp would have impacted the unrealized loss  net of related income tax effects  of the net investment hedge recognized in other comprehensive income in by approximately million  as compared to million in the model assumes an exchange rate of at december  and a tax rate of 
the hypothetical decrease in other comprehensive income in from is a result of a lower amount of gbp denominated debt outstanding 
actual results may differ
