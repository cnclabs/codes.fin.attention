market area prior to acquiring branch offices of ncb  mcb and fnb  we conducted operations primarily in western georgia and eastern alabama  through our main office in west point  georgia troup county  a branch in valley  alabama chambers county  three branches in lagrange  georgia troup county  a branch in opelika  alabama lee county  and two branch offices in auburn  alabama lee county  for a total of eight branch offices 
we acquired four branches in georgia  along the i corridor  in the ncb acquisition in june  and closed one branch 
in march  we acquired four branches of mcb and subsequently closed three of these branches  further expanding our presence in west central georgia with an office in carrollton carroll county 
in september  we acquired eight branches of fnb and we subsequently closed five of these branches in northwest florida 
we kept two branches located in santa rosa county and one branch in escambia county 
the acquisitions have complemented the corporate expansion we have achieved in recent years both through de novo branching and acquisitions 
management believes that the acquisitions are key components to building our retail franchise  as we now have branches on the i corridor and adjacent areas between newnan  georgia and auburn  alabama  and in the florida panhandle 
according to the us census  population in our georgia market area has increased from to  with growth rates of    and for carroll  coweta  fayette  harris  and troup counties  respectively 
as of  the georgia market area s median household income of  was above both the national and state levels 
consistent with national trends  unemployment in the majority of our georgia market areas decreased in from levels 
as of october  the unemployment rate for carroll  coweta  fayette  harris  and troup counties was    and  respectively  compared to    and  respectively  as of october according to the us census  from to  our alabama market area population decreased in chambers county by while increasing in lee county by and the median household income of  was below both the national and alabama state levels as of our alabama market area has seen its unemployment rate in decrease from levels  with the chambers county and lee county unemployment rate at and  respectively  as of october compared to and  respectively  as of october in our florida market area  population increased and for santa rosa county and escambia county  respectively  from to according to the us census 
median household income in our florida market area for was  which was below the national level but above the florida level 
our florida market area has seen its unemployment rate in decrease from levels  with the santa rosa and escambia county unemployment rate at and  respectively  as of october  compared to and  respectively  as of october 
table of contents the outlook for our market area is for modest growth supported by a billion kia motors assembly plant  which opened in february in west point  georgia 
as of november  the million square foot automobile manufacturing plant and its nearby suppliers have created more than  jobs in the area 
the outlook for modest growth is also supported by a military base realignment which has added significantly to employment at fort benning in columbus  georgia 
additionally  in the spring of  point university  formerly known as atlanta christian college  moved their main campus from east point  georgia to west point  georgia  and with it  its students and numerous facility and staff 
however  the market area is significantly overbanked  especially newnan and coweta county 
this has limited our ability to expand organically  thus making growth more dependent upon acquisitions and de novo branching into new markets 
we will seek to take advantage of the profitable growth opportunities presented within our expanded market area  and capitalize on our expanded retail footprint resulting from acquisitions 
the economy of the florida panhandle is primarily dependent upon tourism and hospitality  farming  forestry  paper mills  import export shipping  shipbuilding  and commercial fishing 
over the next five years  our florida markets are projected to experience moderate growth in terms of total population and number of households 
the outlook for our florida panhandle market is affected by the heavy influences of military bases and tourism 
competition we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
west central georgia  east central alabama and the florida panhandle have a high concentration of financial institutions  many of which are branches of large money center  super regional  and regional banks that have resulted from the consolidation of the banking industry in georgia  alabama  and florida 
many of these competitors have greater resources than we do and may offer services that we do not provide 
our competition for loans comes from commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking firms  credit unions  finance companies  credit card banks  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
our most direct competition for deposits historically has come from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  and mutual funds 
we face additional competition for deposits from short term money market funds and other corporate and government securities funds  from brokerage firms  insurance companies and non traditional financial institutions  including non depository financial services providers 
fdic assisted acquisitions neighborhood community bank 
on june   charterbank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with the fdic to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of ncb  a full service commercial bank headquartered in newnan  georgia 
the ncb acquisition extended our retail branch footprint as part of our efforts to increase our retail deposits and reduce our reliance on brokered deposits and borrowings as a significant source of funds

lending activities we offer a broad range of loan products with a variety of rates and terms 
our lending operations consist of the following major segments commercial real estate lending  single family residential mortgage lending for retention in our portfolio  construction lending  and residential mortgage lending for resale in the secondary mortgage market  generally on a servicing released basis 
to a lesser extent  we also originate consumer loans including home equity loans and other forms of consumer installment credit  and commercial business loans 
this strategy is consistent with our community bank orientation 
we have pursued loan diversification with the objective of lowering credit concentration risk  enhancing yields and earnings  and improving the interest sensitivity of our assets 
historically  we have focused our lending activities on residential and commercial mortgage loans as well as consumer loans  primarily to local customers 
we also have initiated retail and commercial business lending in the markets formerly served by ncb  mcb and fnb branches 
commercial real estate loans 
commercial real estate lending is an integral part of our operating strategy and we intend to continue to take advantage of opportunities to originate commercial real estate loans  especially in our newest markets of carroll  coweta and fayette counties in georgia and santa rosa and escambia counties in florida 
commercial real estate loans typically have higher yields  better interest rate risk characteristics and larger loan balances compared to residential mortgage loans 
commercial real estate lending also has provided us with another means of broadening our range of customer relationships 
as of september   non covered commercial real estate loans totaled million  or of our total non covered loan portfolio 
additionally  at september   we had million contractual amount of commercial real estate loans covered by fdic loss sharing agreements  or of total covered loans 
commercial real estate loans are generally made to georgia  alabama or florida borrowers and are secured by properties in these states 
commercial real estate loans are generally made for up to of the value of the underlying real estate 
our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by offices  hotels  strip shopping centers  warehouses distribution facilities  land  or convenience stores located principally in georgia  alabama and florida 
multi family mortgage loans  which we categorize as a subset of our commercial real estate loans  are originated for both new and existing properties and are made on apartment buildings with a wide range of tenant income levels 
many of our multi family mortgage loans are secured by properties located near college campuses 
commercial real estate lending involves additional risks compared to one to four family residential lending 
repayment of commercial real estate loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers  and commercial 
table of contents real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans 
to compensate for the increased risk  our commercial real estate loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter maturities than our residential mortgage loans 
we offer commercial real estate loans at fixed rates and adjustable rates tied to the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal 
however  the interest rates on a portion of our commercial real estate loan portfolio are tied to libor 
we currently offer fixed rate terms of years  however  in prior years we originated fixed rate loans with maturities of up to years 
our underwriting criteria for commercial real estate loans include maximum loan to value ratios  debt coverage ratios  secondary sources of repayment  guarantor requirements  net worth requirements and quality of cash flow 
as part of our loan approval and underwriting of commercial real estate loans  we undertake a cash flow analysis  and we generally require a debt service coverage ratio of at least times 
our capacity to expand this portfolio may be tempered by lack of demand from qualified borrowers  intense competition for good loans  and possible loan concentrations 
residential mortgage loans 
we originate first and second mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties within georgia  florida and alabama 
we currently originate mortgages in all of our markets  but utilize centralized processing at our corporate office 
as of september   non covered residential mortgage loans totaled million  or of total non covered loans 
as of september   covered residential mortgage loans totaled million contractual amount  or of total covered loans 
we originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
fixed rate  year  conforming loans are generally originated for resale into the secondary market on a servicing released basis 
previously  we originated year fixed rate loans and retained them in our portfolio 
going forward  it is our intent to originate these year fixed rate loans for resale into the secondary market 
we generally retain in our portfolio loans that are non conforming due to property exceptions and loans that have adjustable rates 
as of september   approximately of our one to four family loan portfolio consisted of fixed rate mortgage loans and consisted of either adjustable rate mortgage loans arms or hybrid loans with fixed interest rates for the first one  three  five or seven years of the loan  and adjustable rates thereafter 
after the initial term  the interest rate on arms generally adjusts on an annual basis at a fixed spread over the monthly average yield on united states treasury securities  the prime interest rate as listed in the wall street journal  or libor 
the interest rate adjustments are generally subject to a maximum increase of per adjustment period and over the life of the loan 
charterbank originates one to four family loans with loan to values of up to 
we will occasionally originate loans with loan to values in excess of with private mortgage insurance 
the substantial portion of our one to four family residential mortgage loans are secured by properties in georgia  alabama and florida 
the amount of subprime loans held by charterbank is not material 
we consider subprime loans to be loans originated to borrowers having credit scores below at the time of origination 
as of september   the company had total subprime loans of million 
we do not  and have not  originated low documentation or no documentation loans  option arm loans  or other loans with special or unusual payment arrangements 
we modify residential mortgage loans when it is mutually beneficial to us and the borrower  and on terms that are appropriate to the circumstances 
we have no non covered loans in government modification programs 
covered loans have fdic modification programs available  these programs are outlined in their respective purchase and assumption agreements 
construction loans 
consistent with our community bank strategy  construction lending has been an integral part of our overall lending strategy 
construction loans represent an important segment of the loan portfolio  totaling million  or of non covered loans at september  we have no remaining construction loans covered by loss sharing as construction loans have a short maturity and generally  a shorter resolution time than many other loans 
we make loans primarily for the construction of one to four family residences but also for multi family and nonresidential real estate projects on a select basis 
we offer construction loans to builders including both speculative unsold and pre sold loans to pre approved local builders 
the number of speculative loans that we will extend to a builder at one time depends upon the financial strength and credit history of the builder 
our construction loan program is expected to remain a modest portion of our loan volume 
we generally limit the number of outstanding loans on unsold homes under construction within a specific area and or to a specific borrower 
commercial loans and consumer loans 
to a much lesser extent  we also originate non mortgage loans  including commercial business and consumer loans 
at september   non covered commercial loans totaled million  or of total non covered loans  and non covered consumer and other loans totaled million  or of non covered loans 
additionally  at september   we had million contractual amount of commercial loans and million contractual amount of consumer and other loans covered by fdic loss sharing agreements 

table of contents our consumer loans are loans on deposits  second mortgage loans  home equity lines of credit  automobile loans and various other installment loans 
we primarily offer consumer loans excluding second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit as an accommodation to customers 
consumer loans tend to have a higher credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they may be secured by rapidly depreciable assets  or may be unsecured 
our consumer lending generally follows accepted industry standards for non subprime lending  including credit scores and debt to income ratios 
we offer home equity lines of credit as a complement to our one to four family residential mortgage lending 
we believe that offering home equity credit lines helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross marketing opportunities 
home equity credit lines have adjustable rates and are secured by a first or second mortgage on owner occupied one to four family residences located primarily in georgia  alabama and florida 
home equity credit lines enable customers to borrow at rates tied to the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal 
the underwriting standards applicable to home equity credit lines are similar to those for one to four family residential mortgage loans  except for slightly more stringent credit to income and credit score requirements 
home equity loans are generally limited to of the value of the underlying property unless the loan is covered by private mortgage insurance or a loss sharing agreement 
at september   we had million of home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans not covered by the fdic 
we had million of unfunded home equity line of credit commitments not covered by the fdic at september  our commercial business loans are generally limited to terms of five years or less 
we typically attempt to collateralize these loans with a lien on commercial real estate or  occasionally  with a lien on business assets and equipment 
we also generally require the personal guarantee of the business owner 
interest rates on commercial business loans are generally higher than interest rates on residential or commercial real estate loans due to the risk inherent in this type of loan 
commercial business loans are generally considered to have more risk than residential mortgage loans or commercial real estate loans because the collateral may be in the form of intangible assets and or readily depreciable inventory 
commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers  with the repayment of such loans typically dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower or guarantors 
such risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions 
in addition  commercial business lending generally requires substantially greater supervision efforts by our management compared to residential mortgage or commercial real estate lending 
loan origination and approval procedures and authority 
the following describes our current lending procedures for residential mortgage loans and home equity loans and lines of credit 
upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower  we order a credit report and verify other information 
if necessary  we obtain additional financial or credit related information 
we require an appraisal for all residential mortgage loans  except for home equity loans or lines where a valuation may be used to determine the loan to value ratio 
appraisals are performed by licensed or certified third party appraisal firms and are reviewed by our lending department 
we require title insurance or a title opinion on all mortgage loans 
we require borrowers to obtain hazard insurance and we may require borrowers to obtain flood insurance prior to closing 
for properties with a private sewage disposal system  we also require evidence of compliance with applicable laws on residential mortgage loans 
further  we generally require borrowers to advance funds on a monthly basis together with each payment of principal and interest to a mortgage escrow account from which we make disbursements for items such as real estate taxes  hazard insurance  flood insurance  and private mortgage insurance premiums  if required 
commercial loans are approved through charterbank s management loan committee process 
the management loan committee consists of the chief executive officer  the president  the chief financial officer and certain other senior lending and credit officers 
commercial loan relationships of million or less may be approved outside the committee process by two senior officers who have commercial loan authority 
commercial loan relationships greater than million are approved by the management loan committee 
loan originations  participations  purchases and sales 
most of our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our banking office locations and corporate headquarters 
all loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures 
while we originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans  our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks  thrifts  credit unions  and mortgage banking companies 
our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates  and  accordingly  the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period 
consistent with our interest rate risk strategy  in the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years  we have sold almost all fixed rate  year conforming one to four family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market generally on a servicing released basis while retaining commercial real estate loans and non conforming or year fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans for retention in our portfolio 
we sold million of loans in fiscal 
table of contents infrequently  we have purchased loan participations in commercial loans in which we are not the lead lender that are secured by real estate or other assets 
with regard to all loan participations  we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies  and although we may be only approving and servicing a portion of the loan  we underwrite the loan request as if we had originated the loan to ensure cash flow and collateral are sufficient 
at september   our loan participations totaled million  or  of our non covered loan portfolio 
as of september   all of our loan participations were performing in accordance with their terms 
during fiscal we purchased one loan participation in the amount of million that is reflected in our loan balance at september  investments the board of directors reviews and approves our investment policy 
the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as authorized by the board  implement this policy based on the established guidelines within the written investment policy  and other established guidelines  including those set periodically by the asset liability management committee 
the primary goal of our investment policy is to invest funds in assets with varying maturities that will result in the best possible yield while maintaining the safety of the principal invested and assisting in managing our interest rate risk 
we also seek to use our strong capital position to maximize our net income by investing in higher yielding mortgage related securities funded by borrowings 
we also consider our investment portfolio as a source of liquidity 
the broad objectives of our investment portfolio management are to minimize the risk of loss of principal or interest  generate favorable returns without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk  manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities  meet daily  cyclical and long term liquidity requirements while complying with our established policies and regulatory liquidity requirements  provide a stream of cash flow  diversify assets and address maturity or interest repricing imbalances  and provide collateral for pledging requirements 
in determining our investment strategies  we consider our interest rate sensitivity  yield  credit risk factors  maturity and amortization schedules  asset prepayment risks  collateral value and other characteristics of the securities to be held 
sources of funds deposits are the major source of balance sheet funding for lending and other investment purposes 
additional significant sources of funds include liquidity  repayment of loans  loan sales  maturing investments  and borrowings 
we believe that our standing as a sound and secure financial institution and our emphasis on the convenience of our customers will continue to contribute to our ability to attract and retain deposits 
we offer extended hours at the majority of our offices and alternative banking delivery systems that allow customers to pay bills  transfer funds and monitor account balances at any time 
we also offer competitive rates as well as a competitive selection of deposit products  including checking  now  money market  regular savings and term certificate accounts 
in addition  we offer a rewards checking product that offers a higher rate on deposit balances up to  if certain conditions are met 
these conditions include receiving only electronic statements  having at least one monthly ach transaction and ten or more point of sale transactions per month 
for accounts that do not meet these conditions in any given month  the rate paid on the balances is reduced 
we also rely on advertising and long standing relationships to maintain and develop depositor relationships  while competitive rates are also paid to attract and retain deposits 
furthermore  the ncb  mcb  and fnb acquisitions continue to enhance customer convenience by broadening the markets currently served by charterbank 
we continually evaluate opportunities to enhance deposit growth 
potential avenues of growth include de novo branching and branch or institution acquisitions 
additionally  to the extent additional funds are needed  we may employ available collateral to reduce borrowings  which are expected to consist primarily of federal home loan bank advances 
based on asset limitations we have million available at the federal home loan bank of atlanta at september  based on available collateral we are limited to million at september  however  we have reduced and intend to continue to reduce our reliance on wholesale funds 
we have a source of emergency liquidity with the federal reserve  and at september  we had collateral pledged that provided access to approximately million of discount window borrowings 

table of contents employees as of september   we had full time employees and part time employees 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group 
management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees 
subsidiary activities charter financial has no direct or indirect subsidiaries other than charterbank 
supervision and regulation general charter financial is a savings and loan holding company  and is required to file certain reports with  and is subject to examination by  and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board or frb 
charter financial is also subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission under the federal securities laws 
the bank is a federal savings bank  examined and supervised by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and is subject to examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic s deposit insurance fund and depositors 
under this system of federal regulation  financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy  assets  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates 
following completion of its examination  the federal agency critiques the institution s operations and assigns its rating known as an institution s camels rating 
under federal law  an institution may not disclose its camels rating to the public 
the bank also is a member of and owns stock in the fhlb of atlanta  which is one of the twelve regional banks in the federal home loan bank system 
the bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the frb  governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters 
the occ examines the bank and prepares reports for the consideration of the bank s board of directors on any operating deficiencies should any arise 
the bank s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and  to a much lesser extent  state law  especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of the bank s mortgage documents 
any change in these laws or regulations  whether by the fdic  the occ  the frb or congress  could have a material adverse impact on charter financial  the bank and their operations 
certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the bank and charter financial are described below 
this description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank and charter financial and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations 
federal legislation the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act  has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending  investment  trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act eliminated our former primary federal regulator  the office of thrift supervision  and required the bank to be regulated by the occ the primary federal regulator for national banks 
the dodd frank act also authorized the frb to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies 
the dodd frank act also created a new consumer financial protection bureau with substantial power to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as the bank  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
banks and savings institutions with billion or less in assets such as the bank will continue to be examined by their applicable federal bank regulators 
the legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings banks  and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws 
the legislation broadened the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a depository institution instead of aggregate deposits 
the dodd frank act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  and non interest bearing transaction accounts had unlimited deposit insurance through december  the dodd frank act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and so called golden parachute payments 
the legislation also directed the frb to 
table of contents promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded 
the dodd frank act provided for originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans  directed the frb to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act have delayed effective dates and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years 
although the complete substance and scope of these regulations cannot be completely determined at this time  it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations will increase our operating and compliance costs 
federal banking regulation business activities 
a federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act  as amended and federal regulations 
under these laws and regulations  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential real estate without limitations as a percentage of assets  and may invest in non residential real estate loans up to of capital in the aggregate  commercial business loans up to of assets in the aggregate and consumer loans up to of assets in the aggregate 
the bank may also invest in certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
a bank also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for a bank  including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage 
the dodd frank act authorized depository institutions to commence paying interest on business checking accounts  effective july  capital requirements 
federal regulations require savings associations to meet three minimum capital standards a tangible capital ratio  a leverage ratio for savings associations receiving the highest rating on the camels rating system and meeting certain other requirements and an risk based capital ratio 
in addition  the prompt corrective action standards discussed below also establish  in effect  a minimum tangible capital standard  a leverage ratio for institutions receiving the highest rating on the camels financial institution rating system and  together with the risk based capital standard itself  a tier risk based capital standard 
federal regulations also require that in meeting the tangible  leverage and risk based capital standards  institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities that are not permissible for a national bank 
the risk based capital standard for savings associations requires the maintenance of tier core and total capital which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital to risk weighted assets of at least and  respectively 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  including certain off balance sheet assets  are multiplied by a risk weight factor of to or for certain residual interests in transferred assets  assigned by the applicable regulatory agency  based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset 
core capital is defined as common shareholders equity including retained earnings  certain non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships 
the components of supplementary capital currently include cumulative preferred stock  long term perpetual preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock  the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets and up to of net unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values 
overall  the amount of supplementary capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed of core capital 
additionally  a savings association that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale may be required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the recourse back to the savings association 
in assessing an institution s capital adequacy  the occ takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors  and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary 
in july   the occ and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk weighted assets  to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the basel committee on banking supervision and certain provisions of the dodd frank act 
the final rule applies to all depository institutions  top tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of million or more  and top tier savings and loan holding companies banking organizations 
among other things  the rule establishes a new common equity tier minimum capital requirement of risk weighted assets  increases the minimum tier capital to risk based assets requirement from to of risk weighted assets and assigns a higher risk weight to exposures that are more than days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition  development or construction of real property 
the final rule also limits a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of of common equity tier capital to risk weighted assets 
the final rule becomes effective for us on january  the capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning january  and ending january   when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective 

table of contents at september   the bank s capital exceeded all applicable requirements 
loans to one borrower 
generally  a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of unimpaired capital and surplus 
an additional amount may be loaned  equal to of unimpaired capital and surplus  if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral  which generally does not include real estate 
as of september   the bank was in compliance with the loans to one borrower limitations 
qualified thrift lender test 
as a federal savings bank  the bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender  or qtl  test 
under the qtl test  the bank must maintain at least of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including mortgage backed securities in at least nine months of the most recent month period 
portfolio assets generally means total assets of a savings institution  less the sum of specified liquid assets up to of total assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association s business 
the bank also may satisfy the qtl test by qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in the internal revenue code 
a savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions 
under the dodd frank act  non compliance with the qtl test may subject the bank to agency enforcement action for a violation of law 
at september   the bank satisfied the qtl test 
capital distributions 
federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank  which include cash dividends  stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings association 
a federal savings bank must file an application with the occ for approval of a capital distribution if the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association s net income for that year to date plus the savings association s retained net income for the preceding two years that is still available for dividends  the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution  the distribution would violate any applicable statute  regulation  agreement or condition imposed by a regulator  or the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings 
even if an application is not otherwise required  every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company must still file a notice with the frb at least days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution 
the occ and the frb have established similar criteria for approving an application or a notice and may disapprove a notice or application if the savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns  or the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute  regulation or agreement 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution  if the institution would be undercapitalized after the distribution 
liquidity 
a federal savings bank is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation 
community reinvestment act and fair lending laws 
all savings associations have a responsibility under the community reinvestment act and federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in connection with its examination of a federal savings bank  the occ is required to assess the savings association s record of compliance with the community reinvestment act 
in addition  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes 
a savings association s failure to comply with the provisions of the community reinvestment act could  at a minimum  result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers  or in restrictions on its activities 
the failure to comply with the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act could result in enforcement actions by the occ  as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the department of justice 
the bank received a satisfactory community reinvestment act rating in its most recent federal examination 
transactions with related parties 
a federal savings bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by frb regulations and by sections a and b of the federal reserve act and its implementing regulation w 
an affiliate is a company that controls  is controlled by  or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the bank 

table of contents charter financial is an affiliate of the bank 
in general  loan transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements 
in this regard  transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are limited to of the institution s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions with any one affiliate and of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions in the aggregate with all affiliates 
collateral in specified amounts ranging from to of the amount of the transaction must usually be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the savings association 
in addition  federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate  other than a subsidiary 
finally  transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices  not involve low quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non affiliates 
savings associations are required to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates 
the bank s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers and shareholders  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is currently governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the federal reserve act and regulation o of the frb 
among other things  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders subject to certain exceptions for loan law programs made available to all employees  be made on terms that are substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features  and not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons  individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of the bank s capital 
in addition  extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the bank s board of directors 
enforcement 
the occ has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all institution affiliated parties  including shareholders  and attorneys  appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution 
formal enforcement action by the occ may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order  to removal of officers and or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions  and range up to  per day  unless a finding of reckless disregard is made  in which case penalties may be as high as million per day 
the fdic also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the occ that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution 
if action is not taken by the occ  the fdic has authority to take action under specified circumstances 
standards for safety and soundness 
federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions 
these standards relate to  among other things  internal controls  information systems and audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  compensation  and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate 
the federal banking agencies adopted interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines  the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan 
prompt corrective action regulations 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the occ is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings associations 
for this purpose  a savings association is placed in one of the following five categories based on the savings association s capital well capitalized at least leverage capital  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  and is not subject to any written agreement  order  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive issued by the occ or the office of thrift supervision under certain statutes and regulations  to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  adequately capitalized at least leverage capital for associations with a composite camels rating of  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  undercapitalized less than leverage capital except as noted in the bullet point above  tier risk based capital or total risk based capital  significantly undercapitalized less than leverage capital  tier risk based capital or total risk based capital  and critically undercapitalized less than tangible capital 

table of contents generally  the occ is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings association that is critically undercapitalized within specific time frames 
the regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the occ within days of the date a savings association receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
the criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include  among other things  the establishment of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis  procedures for ensuring compliance with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations  the identification of the types and levels of activities the savings association will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect  and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not appreciably increase the current risk profile of the savings association 
any holding company for a savings association required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to of the savings association s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the occ  or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status 
this guarantee remains in place until the occ notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters  and the occ has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee 
failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the savings association  such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends  pay executive compensation and management fees  and increase assets or expand operations 
the occ may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized associations  including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors 
at september   the bank met the criteria for being considered well capitalized 
the recently adopted final rule that will increase regulatory capital requirements will adjust the prompt corrective action categories accordingly 
insurance of deposit accounts 
the dodd frank act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor 
the fdic assesses deposit insurance premiums on all insured depository institutions 
under the fdic s risk based assessment system  insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by fdic regulations  with institutions deemed less risky to the deposit insurance fund paying lower rates 
assessment rates inclusive of possible adjustments currently range from to basis points of each institution s total assets less tangible capital 
the fdic may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly  except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base assessment rate without notice and comment rulemaking 
the fdic s current system represents a change  required by the dodd frank act  from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution s aggregate deposits 
the dodd frank act increased the minimum target ratio for the deposit insurance fund from of estimated insured deposits to of estimated insured deposits  and the fdic must achieve the ratio by september  insured institutions with assets of billion or more are required to fund the increase 
the dodd frank act also eliminated the maximum fund ratio  and instead gives the discretion of the fdic the discretion to determine the maximum fund ratio 
the fdic has exercised that discretion by establishing a long term fund ratio of 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action  condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance 
all fdic insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on obligations issued by the financing corporation fico for anticipated payments  issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the fico in the s to recapitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the bonds issued by the fico are due to mature in through for the quarter ended september   the annualized financing corporation assessment was equal to basis points of total assets less tangible capital 
assessments related to the fico bond obligations were not subject to the december  prepayment 
for the fiscal year ended september   the bank paid  related to the fico bonds and was assessed  pertaining to deposit insurance assessments 
deposit insurance assessments were prepaid in december  for calendar years through  while fico bond payments were prepaid  one quarter in advance 
prohibitions against tying arrangements 
federal savings banks are prohibited  subject to some exceptions  from extending credit to or offering any other service  or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service  on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution

as of september   charter financial corporation has not elected to be a financial holding company 
the home owners loan act prohibits a savings and loan holding company  including charter financial  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries  from acquiring more than of another savings institution or holding company thereof  without prior written approval of the frb 
it also prohibits the acquisition or retention of  with certain exceptions  more than of a non subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the home owners loan act or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured

the states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions 
capital 
savings and loan holding companies are not currently subject to specific regulatory capital requirements 
the dodd frank act  however  requires the frb to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent  both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital  than those applicable to depository institutions themselves 
instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities will no longer be includable as tier capital  as is currently permitted for bank holding companies 
instruments issued prior to may  will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of billion or less 
the final capital rule discussed above implements consolidated capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies effective january  dividends and repurchases 
the frb has issued guidance regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well 
in general  the guidance provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial 
table of contents condition 
the guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances  such as where the company s net income for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid over that period  is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall financial condition 
the ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized 
the guidance also provides for regulatory consultation prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred 
these regulatory policies could affect the ability of the company to pay dividends  repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions 
source of strength 
the dodd frank act extended the source of strength doctrine to savings and loan holding companies 
the regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital  liquidity and other support in times of financial stress 
sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of addresses  among other issues  corporate governance  auditing and accounting  executive compensation  and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information

change in control regulations 
under the change in bank control act  no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company such as charter financial unless the frb has been given days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition  taking into consideration certain factors  including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition 
control  as defined under federal law  means ownership  control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than of any class of voting stock  control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution s directors  or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power  directly or indirectly  to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution

first charter  mhc and charter federal were  and charterbank and charter financial are  subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations  with some exceptions discussed below 
the following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to charter federal  charter financial or charterbank 
method of accounting 
for federal income tax purposes  charter federal reported its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and used a tax year ending september for filing its federal and state income tax returns 
similarly  for federal income tax purposes  charter financial reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending september for filing its federal and state income tax returns 
bad debt reserves 
historically  charterbank has been subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves 
tax law changes were enacted in  pursuant to the small business protection act of the act  that eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after and required recapture into taxable income over a six year period all bad debt reserves accumulated after charterbank has recaptured its reserves accumulated after 
table of contents currently  the charter financial consolidated group uses the specific charge off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes 
taxable distributions and recapture 
prior to  bad debt reserves created prior to were subject to recapture into taxable income if charterbank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions 
tax law changes in eliminated thrift related recapture rules 
however  under current law  pre tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if charterbank makes certain non dividend distributions  repurchases any of its common stock  pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits  or fails to qualify as a bank for tax purposes 
at september   the total federal pre base year bad debt reserve of charterbank was approximately million 
alternative minimum tax 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences  less any available exemption 
the alternative minimum tax is imposed to the extent it exceeds the regular income tax 
net operating losses can offset no more than of alternative taxable income 
certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years 
charter federal consolidated group has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover 
net operating loss carryovers 
generally  a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding taxable years 
however  subject to certain limitations  the carryback period for net operating losses incurred in or but not both years was expanded to five years 
neither charterbank nor charter financial had a loss carryforward at september  corporate dividends received deduction 
charter federal excluded from its federal taxable income of dividends received from charterbank as a wholly owned subsidiary by filing consolidated tax returns 
the corporate dividends received deduction is when the corporation receiving the dividend owns at least of the stock of the distributing corporation

item a 
risk factors if we are unable to replace the revenue we expect to derive from the interest income and continued realization of accretable discounts on our acquired loans and the fdic receivable with new loans and other interest earning assets  our financial condition and earnings may be adversely affected 
as a result of the three fdic assisted acquisitions that we have made and the asset discount bids associated with each acquisition  a significant portion of our income has been derived from the interest income and continued realization of accretable discounts on the loans that we purchased in our fdic assisted acquisitions and from the fdic receivable 
for the year ended september   we recognized million of interest and accretion income on covered loans  with million due to loan accretion 
we have million remaining of discount accretion to be recognized in income over the next three years 
during the period  if we are unable to replace our acquired loans and the related accretion with new performing loans at a similar yield and other interest earning assets due to such reasons as a decline in loan demand or competition from other financial institutions in our markets  our financial condition and earnings  including our interest rate spread  may be adversely affected 

table of contents our business may continue to be adversely affected by downturns in our national and local economies 
our operations are significantly affected by national and local economic conditions 
substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in west central georgia  east central alabama and the florida panhandle 
all of our branches and most of our deposit customers are also located in these areas 
a continuing decline in the economies in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  georgia  alabama and florida have experienced home price declines  increased foreclosures and high unemployment rates 
a further deterioration or minimal improvement in economic conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations demand for our loans  deposits and services may decline  loan delinquencies  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  weak economic conditions may continue to limit the demand for loans by creditworthy borrowers  limiting our capacity to leverage our retail deposits and maintain our net interest income  collateral for our loans may decline further in value  and the amount of our low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease 
we may incur additional losses due to downward revisions to our preliminary estimates of the value of assets acquired in our fdic assisted acquisitions  the expiration of the loss sharing agreements or due to higher than expected charge offs with respect to the assets acquired  which may not be supported by our loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
we acquired approximately million  million and million of assets in connection with the ncb  mcb and fnb acquisitions  respectively 
we marked down these assets to fair value at the date of each acquisition based on preliminary estimates 
there is no assurance that the assets acquired in the ncb  mcb and fnb acquisitions will not suffer further deterioration in value after the date of acquisition  which would require additional charge offs 
we entered into loss sharing agreements with the fdic that provide that of losses related to the acquired loans and other real estate owned covered assets up to million in losses with respect to the million of ncb covered assets  up to million in losses with respect to the million of mcb covered assets will be borne by the fdic and thereafter the fdic will bear of losses on ncb and mcb covered assets 
we also entered into a loss sharing agreement with the fdic that provides that of losses related to the covered assets of million acquired in the fnb transaction will be borne by the fdic 
however  we are not protected from all losses resulting from charge offs with respect to such covered assets 
internal costs incurred to collect and otherwise resolve covered assets are borne by us and not subject to loss sharing reimbursement 
further  the loss sharing agreements have limited terms ranging from five years for commercial loans to ten years for residential mortgage loans 
therefore  any charge offs or related losses that we experience after the expiration of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the fdic  including the write down of the fdic indemnification asset  and would reduce our net income 
finally  if we fail to comply with the terms of the loss sharing agreements  we could lose the right to receive payments on a covered asset from the fdic under the agreements 
see our ability to continue to receive benefits of our loss share arrangements with the fdic is conditioned upon our compliance with certain requirements under the agreements  below 
we may not be able to collect all of the fdic indemnification asset from the fdic due to the fdic s policy on the administration of certain loss sharing claims 
there may be some assets covered by loss sharing that we are unable to collect the loss reimbursement from the fdic before the loss sharing reimbursement period ends 
in many cases the basis for reimbursement is an appraisal of real estate for a proposed sale 
many of the loss share assets are real estate located in geographic areas where there is still not an orderly market with willing buyers and willing sellers which frequently results in appraisals with values for properties that attract no buyers 
the fdic will only pay loss sharing claims that approximate a current appraisal 
if the company is unable to sell real estate covered by loss sharing at prices that approximate the property s appraisal  the company may incur the loss without loss sharing which would reduce its net income 

table of contents our non covered commercial real estate  real estate construction  and commercial business loans increase our exposure to credit risks 
over the last several years  we have increased our non residential lending in order to improve the yield and reduce the average duration of our assets 
at september   our portfolio of non covered commercial real estate  real estate construction  and commercial business loans totaled million  or of total non covered loans  compared to million  or of total loans all of which were non covered at september  at september   the amount of non covered non performing commercial real estate and commercial business loans was million 
at september   our largest non covered non residential real estate borrowing relationship was million  consisting of a borrower whose collateral was multiple one to four family residential real estate construction loans 
these loans may expose us to a greater risk of non payment and loss than residential real estate loans because  in the case of commercial loans  repayment often depends on the successful operation and earnings of the borrowers and  in the case of consumer loans  the applicable collateral is subject to rapid depreciation 
additionally  commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans 
if loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired  then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest due on the loan  which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
if the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms  and the collateral  if any  securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
we may experience significant loan losses  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  which would require additions to the allowance 
additions to the allowance would decrease our net income 
at september   our allowance for loan losses for non covered loans was million  or of total non covered loans and of non covered non performing loans  compared to million  or of total non covered loans and of non covered non performing loans at september  at september   million of nonperforming loans were not covered by loss sharing 
our level of commercial real estate  real estate construction and commercial business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating the allowance for loan losses 
these loans may require increased provisions for loan losses in the future  which would decrease our earnings 
bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase to the provision for loan losses or further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs would decrease our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition 
we could record future losses on our securities portfolio 
for the year ended september   we recorded  in other than temporary impairment charges on non government agency collateralized mortgage obligations 
there were no other than temporary impairment charges for the year ended september  at september   our securities portfolio totaled million  which included million of non government agency collateralized mortgage obligations with net unrealized losses of  a number of factors or combinations of factors could require us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to these securities constitutes an impairment that is other than temporary  which would result in additional losses that could be material 
these factors include  but are not limited to  a continued failure by the issuer to make scheduled interest payments  an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security  an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions and or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value 
in addition  the fair values of securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of some of the underlying borrowers deteriorate 
these securities have limited liquidity and additional impairment charges may be required in future periods 
deterioration in private label securities or changes in regulatory capital requirements may reduce our regulatory capital or increase classified assets 

table of contents if our problem assets increase  our earnings will decrease 
at september   our non performing assets which consist of non accrual loans  loans days or more delinquent  and foreclosed real estate assets not covered by loss sharing agreements consisted of million of loans and million of foreclosed real estate 
as of september   we also had covered foreclosed real estate of million 
in addition  our non covered classified assets consisting of substandard loans and securities  doubtful loans and loss assets totaled million at september  our problem assets adversely affect our net income in various ways 
we do not record interest income on non accrual loans or real estate owned 
based on our estimate of the level of allowance for loan losses required  we record a provision for loan losses as a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level 
from time to time  we also write down the value of properties in our real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values 
additionally  there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes  insurance and maintenance related to our real estate owned 
further  the resolution of problem assets requires the active involvement of management  which could detract from the overall supervision of our operations 
finally  if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate  we will have to increase the allowance accordingly 
our ability to continue to receive the benefits of our loss share arrangements with the fdic is conditioned upon our compliance with certain requirements under the agreements 
our ability to recover a portion of our losses and retain the loss share protection is subject to our compliance with certain requirements imposed on us in the loss share agreements with the fdic 
these requirements relate primarily to our administration of the assets covered by the agreements  as well as our obtaining the consent of the fdic to engage in certain corporate transactions that may be deemed under the agreements to constitute a transfer of the loss share benefits 
for example  any merger or consolidation of charterbank with another financial institution would require the consent of the fdic under the loss share agreements relating to the ncb  mcb and fnb transactions 
in instances where the fdic s consent is required under the loss share agreements  the fdic may withhold its consent to such transactions or may condition its consent on terms that we do not find acceptable 
if the fdic does not grant its consent to a transaction we would like to pursue  or conditions its consent on terms that we do not find acceptable  this may cause us not to engage in a corporate transaction that might otherwise benefit our shareholders or we may elect to pursue such a transaction without obtaining the fdic s consent  which could result in termination of our loss share agreements with the fdic 
we may fail to realize any benefits from  and may incur unanticipated losses related to  the assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed from neighborhood community bank  mcintosh commercial bank and the first national bank of florida 
the success of the ncb  mcb and fnb acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to successfully combine the businesses and assets we acquired with our business  and our ability to successfully manage the significant loan portfolios that were acquired 
it may take longer to successfully liquidate the nonperforming assets that were acquired in the ncb  mcb and fnb transactions 
as with any acquisition involving a financial institution  there may also be business and service changes and disruptions that result in the loss of customers or cause customers to close their accounts and move their business to competing financial institutions 
it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees  the disruption of ongoing business  or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients  customers  depositors and employees  or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions 
successful integration may also be hampered by differences between our organization and the ncb  mcb and fnb organizations 
the loss of key employees of ncb  mcb and or fnb could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct business in the markets in which ncb  mcb and fnb operated  which could adversely affect our financial results 
integration efforts will also divert attention and resources from our management 
in addition  general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our ability to successfully integrate these operations 
if we experience difficulties with the integration process  the anticipated benefits of the transactions may not be realized fully  or at all  or may take longer to realize than expected 
finally  any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings 

table of contents acquisitions  including any additional fdic assisted acquisitions  could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results 
on june  we entered into an agreement with the fdic to acquire assets from neighborhood community bank with a fair value of approximately million and assume liabilities from such bank with a fair value of approximately million 
we also acquired four branches of ncb in the transaction  one of which has been closed 
on march   we entered into an agreement with the fdic to acquire assets of mcintosh commercial bank with a fair value of approximately million and assume liabilities from such bank with a fair value of approximately million 
we also acquired four branches of mcb in the transaction  three of which have been closed 
on september   we entered into an agreement with the fdic to acquire assets of first national bank of florida with a fair value of approximately million and assume liabilities from such bank with a fair value of approximately million 
we also acquired eight branches of fnb in the transaction  five of which have been closed 
we expect to continue to grow by acquiring other financial institutions  related businesses or branches of other financial institutions that we believe provide a strategic fit with our business  which may or may not include loss sharing transactions 
to the extent that we grow through acquisitions  we may not be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth 
in addition  such acquisitions may involve the issuance of securities  which may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share 
acquiring banks  bank branches or businesses involves risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities we acquire  exposure to potential asset quality problems of the acquired financial institutions  businesses or branches  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of financial institutions  businesses or branches we acquire  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of financial institutions  businesses or branches we acquire  difficulty in safely investing any cash generated by the acquisition  inability to utilize potential tax benefits from such transactions  difficulty in estimating the fair value of the financial institutions  businesses or branches to be acquired which affects the profits we generate from the acquisitions  and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the financial institutions or businesses to be acquired 
our management team s strategies for the enhancement of shareholder value may not succeed 
our management team is taking actions to enhance shareholder value  including consolidating branches  reviewing personnel  developing new products  and continuing to review fdic assisted acquisition opportunities 
in addition  we intend to focus on opportunities for cross selling products to existing customers in an effort to deepen our share of wallet 
these actions may not enhance shareholder value 
as a community bank  our recruitment efforts may not be sufficient enough to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations 
as we continue to grow  we may find our recruiting efforts more challenging 
if we do not succeed in attracting  hiring  and integrating experienced or qualified personnel  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
additionally  we may be unable to grow efficiently and effectively 
we are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance 
our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business 
as such  we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation 
this is done  in part  by recruiting  hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve  delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates 
if our reputation is negatively affected  by the actions of our employees or otherwise  our business and  therefore  our operating results may be materially adversely affected 

table of contents historically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability 
during the past five years it has been the policy of the board of governors of the federal reserve system to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
historically  our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest earning assets 
as a result  rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities have decreased more quickly than the rates we pay on the loans we have originated and the securities we have purchased 
consequently  our interest rate spreads have increased in the short term 
however  our ability to reduce our interest expense is now highly limited compared to the ability for average yields on our interest earning assets to continue to decrease 
the frb has indicated its intention to maintain low interest rates in the near future 
accordingly  our interest rate spreads and our net interest income the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities may decrease  which would adversely affect our profitability 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
because our interest bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest earning assets  a sustained increase in interest rates generally would tend to reduce our interest income 
changes in interest rates may also affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
also  increases in interest rates may extend the life of fixed rate assets  which would restrict our ability to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives  and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive on a new investment 
changes in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest earning securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates 
at september   the fair value of our portfolio of investment securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations totaled million 
net unrealized losses on these securities totaled million at september  additionally  a majority of our single family mortgage loan portfolio is comprised of adjustable rate loans 
any rise in market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable rate mortgage loans  which would increase the possibility of default 
strong competition and changing banking environment may limit growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere  and non traditional financial institutions  including non depository financial services providers 
many of these competitors whether regional or national institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
additionally  non traditional financial institutions may not have the same regulatory requirements or burdens as we do even while playing a rapidly increasing role in the financial services industry  which could ultimately limit our growth  profitability and shareholder value 
our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market areas and adapt to the ever changing banking environment 
financial reform legislation has  among other things  eliminated the office of thrift supervision  tightened capital standards and created a new consumer financial protection bureau  and will result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations  and consequently many of the details and much of the impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for many months or years 
among other things  as a result of the dodd frank act 
table of contents the office of the comptroller of the currency became the primary federal regulator for federal savings banks such as charterbank replacing the office of thrift supervision  and the frb now supervises and regulates all savings and loan holding companies that were formerly regulated by the office of thrift supervision  including charter financial  effective july   the federal prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits has been eliminated  thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts 
this change has increased our interest expense  the frb is required to set minimum capital levels for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries  and the components of tier capital are required to be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be tier capital for insured depository institutions 
there is a five year transition period from the july  effective date of the dodd frank act before the capital requirements will apply to savings and loan holding companies 
however  the new rule for savings and loan holding companies has set january  as the date the new capital requirements will begin to apply  the federal banking regulators are required to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off balance sheet activities and other risks  including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives  a new consumer financial protection bureau has been established  which has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
banks and savings institutions with billion or less in assets  like charterbank  will be examined by their applicable bank regulators  and federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings banks have been weakened  and state attorneys general have the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws 
in addition to the risks noted above  we expect that our operating and compliance costs  and possibly our interest expense  could increase as a result of the dodd frank act and the implementing rules and regulations 
the need to comply with additional rules and regulations  as well as state laws and regulations to which we were not previously subject  will also divert management s time from managing our operations 
higher capital levels would require us to maintain higher levels of assets that earn less interest and dividend income and returns on shareholders equity would suffer 
we will become subject to more stringent capital requirements  which may adversely impact our return on equity  require us to raise additional capital  or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares 
in july  the occ and the federal reserve board approved a new rule that will substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to charterbank and charter financial 
the final rule implements the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the dodd frank act 
the final rule includes new minimum risk based capital and leverage ratios  which will be effective for charterbank and charter financial on january   and refines the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating these ratios 
the new minimum capital requirements will be i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier to risk based assets capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of 
the final rule also establishes a capital conservation buffer of  and will result in the following minimum ratios i a common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier to risk based assets capital ratio of  and iii a total capital ratio of 
the new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in january at of risk weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in january an institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends  engaging in share repurchases  and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount 
these limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions 
the application of more stringent capital requirements for charterbank and charter financial could  among other things  result in lower returns on equity  require the raising of additional capital  and result in regulatory actions such as the inability to pay dividends or repurchase shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements 
new regulations could restrict our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans 
the consumer financial protection bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the dodd frank act  which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower s ability to repay a mortgage 
loans that meet this qualified mortgage definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability to repay standard 
under the consumer financial protection bureau s rule  a qualified mortgage loan must not contain certain specified features  including 
table of contents excessive upfront points and fees those exceeding of the total loan amount  less bona fide discount points for prime loans  interest only payments  negative amortization  and terms longer than years 
also  to qualify as a qualified mortgage  a borrower s total monthly debt to income ratio may not exceed 
lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years  taking into account all applicable taxes  insurance and assessments 
the consumer financial protection bureau s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers  or could make it more expensive and or time consuming to make these loans  which could limit our growth or profitability 
our stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market 
however  the average daily trading volume in charter financial s common stock has been relatively small  averaging less than approximately  shares per day during as a result  trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock  and it may be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price 
government responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our operations  financial condition and earnings 
the dodd frank act has changed the bank regulatory framework  created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies  and established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies 
bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations 
ongoing uncertainty and adverse developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets  and the effect of the dodd frank act and regulatory actions  may adversely affect our operations by increasing ongoing compliance costs and restricting our business activities  including our ability to originate or sell loans  modify loan terms  or foreclose on property securing loans 
these risks could affect the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios  which also would negatively affect our financial performance 
if the frb increases the federal funds rate  overall interest rates will likely rise  which may negatively impact the housing markets and the us economic recovery 
in addition  deflationary pressures  while possibly lowering our operating costs  could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers  especially our business borrowers  and the values of underlying collateral securing loans  which could negatively affect our financial performance 
changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income 
in response to the financial crisis of and early  congress has taken actions that are intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in financial institutions  and the fdic has taken actions to increase insurance coverage on deposit accounts 
in addition  there have been proposals made by members of congress and others that would reduce the amount delinquent borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay on their mortgage loans and limit an institution s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral 
moreover  bank regulatory agencies have responded aggressively to concerns and trends identified in examinations  and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements 
bank regulatory agencies  such as the office of the comptroller of the currency and the fdic  govern the activities in which we may engage  primarily for the protection of depositors  and not for the protection or benefit of potential investors 
in addition  new laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs of regulatory compliance and costs of doing business  and otherwise affect our operations 
new laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the markets for and value of our loans and investments  the fees we can charge  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
for example  recent regulatory changes to our overdraft protection programs could decrease the amount of fees we receive for these services 
for the years ended september  and  overdraft protection fees totaled million and million  respectively 
further  legislative proposals limiting our rights as a creditor could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
regulations limit interchange fees for banks with assets of more than billion 
it is unclear whether in the future these limits will apply to smaller banks such as charterbank 

table of contents we hold certain intangible assets that in the future could be classified as either partially or fully impaired  which would reduce our earnings and the book values of these assets 
pursuant to applicable accounting requirements  we are required to periodically test our goodwill and core deposit intangible assets for impairment 
the impairment testing process considers a variety of factors  including the current market price of our common shares  the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions 
future impairment testing may result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill or core deposit intangible assets  or both 
if an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period  our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment 
any requested or required changes in how we determine the impact of loss share accounting on our financial statements could have a material or adverse effect on our reported results 
our financial results are significantly based on loss share accounting  which is subject to assumptions and judgments made by us 
loss share accounting is a complex accounting methodology 
many of the decisions management makes regarding the application of this accounting methodology may be revised at the request of various regulatory agencies to whom we report 
as such  any financial information generated through the use of loss share accounting is subject to change 
any significant change in such information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our previously reported results 
because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions  we face significant operational risks 
we operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions 
operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including but not limited to  the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees errors relating to transaction processing and technology  breaches of the internal control systems and compliance requirements  and business continuation and disaster recovery 
insurance coverage may not be available for such losses  or where available  such losses may exceed insurance limits 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards  adverse business decisions or their implementation  and customer attrition due to negative publicity 
in the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems  improper operation of systems or improper employee actions  we could suffer financial loss  face regulatory action  and suffer damage to our reputation 
we may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
system failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
the computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event  as well as from security breaches  denial of service attacks  viruses  worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers 
any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
computer break ins  phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  which may result in violations of consumer privacy laws including the gramm leach bliley act  cause significant liability to us and give reason for existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us 
although we  with the help of third party service providers  intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage and potential liability  there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful 
in addition  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data 
a failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents hurricanes or other adverse weather events would negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations  which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
our market area is located in the southeastern region of the united states and is susceptible to natural disasters  such as hurricanes  tornadoes  tropical storms  other severe weather events and related flooding and wind damage  and man made disasters 
these natural disasters could negatively impact regional economic conditions  cause a decline in the value or destruction of mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies  foreclosures or loss on loans originated by us  damage our banking facilities and offices and negatively impact our growth strategy 
such weather events can disrupt operations  result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where they operate 
we cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future hurricanes or tornadoes will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas  but such weather events could negatively impact economic conditions in these regions and result in a decline in local loan demand and loan originations  a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies  foreclosures or loan losses 
our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of natural or manmade disasters

the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the high and low sales prices of our common stock

as of november   there were approximately holders of record of our common stock 
dividends 
the company started paying a quarterly cash dividend in september beginning with the dividend paid for the quarter ended march   we reduced our quarterly dividend from per share to per share 
the reduction of the dividend reflected our decision to pursue opportunities for deployment of capital in fdic assisted transactions such as the neighborhood community bank  mcintosh commercial bank and the first national bank of florida transactions 
the dividend rate and the continued payment of dividends will primarily depend on our earnings  alternative uses for capital  such as capital requirements  acquisition opportunities  our financial condition and results of operations  statutory and regulatory limitations affecting dividends and the policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb and  to a lesser extent  tax considerations and general economic conditions 
the company briefly discontinued the quarterly cash dividend following the dividend paid in may but reinstated the quarterly cash dividend in may under the rules of the office of comptroller of the currency and the frb  charterbank is not permitted to make a capital distribution if  after making such distribution  it would be undercapitalized 
for information concerning additional federal laws and regulations regarding the ability of charterbank to make capital distributions  including the payment of dividends to charter financial  see part i  item business taxation federal taxation and supervision and regulation federal banking regulation 
unlike charterbank  charter financial is not restricted by office of the comptroller of the currency regulations on the payment of dividends to its shareholders 
however  the frb has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has also made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well 
in general  the frb s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
frb guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company s net income for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid over that period  is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall financial condition 

table of contents the ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized 
these regulatory policies could affect the ability of charter financial to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions 
in addition  the source of dividends that may be paid by charter financial depends on the net proceeds retained by it and earnings thereon  and dividends from charterbank 
in addition  pursuant to applicable regulations  during the three year period following our conversion and stock offering in april   we will not take any action to declare an extraordinary dividend to shareholders that would be treated by recipients as a tax free return of capital for federal income tax purposes

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  investment securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and other interest earning assets primarily cash and cash equivalents  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
our business is affected by prevailing general and local economic conditions  particularly market interest rates  and by government policies concerning  among other things  monetary and fiscal affairs and housing 
in addition  we are subject to extensive regulations applicable to financial institutions  lending and other operations  privacy  and consumer disclosure 
as a result of our loan underwriting policies  management believes that we have not suffered the same level of loan losses during the recent economic downturn as many financial institutions in our market area 
consequently  we have been able to take advantage of attractive low risk opportunities to enhance our banking franchise through the purchase of distressed banking franchises from the fdic 
on april   we completed our conversion from the mutual holding company to the stock holding company form of organization 
as a result of the stock offering  we received gross proceeds of million 
our net income increased million and totaled million for the year ended september   from million for the year ended september  the increase in net income for fiscal resulted primarily from decreases in noninterest expense and provision for loan losses and was partially offset by a decrease in net interest income and an increase in income tax expense 
net interest income decreased million to million for the year ended september  due primarily to a decrease in average loan balances and was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit and borrowings 
noninterest income decreased million to million for the year ended september  due primarily to decreases in fdic indemnification asset income and gain on sale of securities available for sale  partially offset by increased fee income on deposits 
most of the reduction in the fdic indemnification asset income was due to amortization of impairment 
during the year ended september   we reduced income by million and based on september  estimates of cash flows  have million remaining to be amortized 
our provision for non covered loan losses was million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  this decrease in the provision for non covered loan loss was a result of a decrease in net charge offs for the year ended september  as compared to a million charge off of specific allowances of impaired loans as required by the office of the comptroller of the currency policy for the year ended september  as we converted to being regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency instead of the office of thrift supervision 
noninterest expense decreased million to million for the year ended september  due primarily to a decrease in cost of real estate owned reo and decreases in compensation expense and marketing expense both due to increased costs related to acquisitions 
our net income increased million and totaled million for the year ended september   from million for the year ended september  the increase in net income for fiscal resulted primarily from increases in net interest income  noninterest income and a reduction in income tax expense  partially offset by an increase in our provision for non covered loan losses and an increase in noninterest expense 
net interest income increased million to million for the year ended september  due to the covered loans acquired in the fnb acquisition in september and a reduction in the cost of funds as a result of the low interest rate environment and a reduction in fhlb borrowings 
noninterest income increased million to million for the year ended september  due primarily to a million reduction in other than temporary impairment charges and an increase of million in fees on checking accounts 
our provision for non covered loan losses was million for the year ended september  as compared to million for the year ended september  as a result of an increase in net charge offs due in part to million in charge offs of specific allowances of impaired loans as required by office of the comptroller of the currency policy 
noninterest expense increased million to million for the year ended september  due primarily to the cost of operating  integrating and managing the assets acquired from the fdic as receiver of fnb in september business strategy our business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized and profitable community bank dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our individual and business customers 
we believe that we have a competitive advantage in the markets we serve because of our knowledge of the local marketplace and our long standing history of providing superior  relationship based customer service 
this year history in the community  combined with management s extensive experience and adherence to 
table of contents conservative underwriting standards through numerous business cycles  has enabled us to maintain a strong capital position with favorable credit quality metrics despite the economic downturn 
on april   we completed our conversion from the mutual holding company form of organization to the fully public stock holding company form of organization and raised million in gross offering proceeds from the related stock offering 
the company intends to continue to manage its capital position in order to provide value to its shareholders through actions such as paying cash dividends and  when permitted  repurchasing shares of the company s common stock 
the company currently pays a quarterly cash dividend of per share and paid a special dividend of per share to shareholders on july  under federal reserve board regulations  the company is generally prohibited from repurchasing shares of its stock during the first year following the completion of the conversion  except to fund restricted stock awards under an equity incentive plan 
the board of directors of the company will evaluate the relative benefits of initiating a stock repurchase plan when permitted under federal regulations 
we believe that the current economic and financial services environment presents a significant opportunity for us to grow our retail banking operations 
through our fdic assisted acquisitions in june  march and september  we acquired sixteen full service branch offices  of which seven were retained 
we also acquired deposits of million in the three transactions 
in each of the fdic assisted acquisitions  we participated in a competitive bid process in which we offered an asset discount bid on net assets acquired and no deposit premium 
we also entered into loss sharing agreements with the fdic which cover a majority of the assets acquired referred to as covered assets and provide for substantial protection on losses associated with the covered assets 
see fdic assisted acquisitions below 
based on the persistent challenges presented by the economic and regulatory climate along with increased compliance costs and an accelerated need for economies of scale  we expect there to be a significant amount of unassisted consolidation in our banking markets which we intend to explore as opportunities arise 
we believe that our strong financial condition and capital position are desirable traits for smaller community banking institutions seeking a merger partner 
as a result  while we will continue to analyze opportunities for fdic assisted transactions  these transactions will not be available for an indefinite period of time and therefore we will also look to fill out the franchise through conservatively structured unassisted transactions 
our knowledge of the marketplace and our experienced management team  together with our experience in managing problem assets acquired from the fdic in the ncb  mcb  and fnb transactions position us to take advantage of future opportunities to acquire troubled and other financial institutions in our market area through unassisted transactions 
key aspects of our business strategy include the following leverage capital through disciplined acquisitions 
the economy and banking industry in our market area of west central georgia  east central alabama and the florida panhandle continue to face significant challenges as many banks have experienced capital and liquidity losses as a result of significant charge offs associated with troubled loan credits 
these challenges have created strategic growth opportunities for us 
our discipline and selectivity in identifying target franchises  along with our successful history of working with the fdic  such as in the ncb  mcb and fnb transactions  and the additional capital raised through our second step conversion provide us an advantage in pursuing and consummating future acquisitions 
we intend to leverage our capital base and acquisition experience to selectively pursue conservatively structured unassisted transactions of select franchises that present attractive risk adjusted returns 
in addition  future acquisitions will enable us to further utilize our substantial infrastructure devoted to the workout of special assets 
expand our retail banking franchise 
our focus is on growing our retail banking presence throughout the markets in west central georgia  east central alabama  and the florida panhandle  including our expanded retail footprint resulting from the ncb  mcb and fnb acquisitions  while reducing reliance on wholesale funding sources 
since september  we have reduced fhlb borrowings by million and certificates of deposit by million in our efforts to fund our balance sheet with core deposits comprised of transaction  savings and money market accounts 
over this same time period we have increased core deposits from million to million while lowering our cost of funds from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  these deposits provide a low cost source of funds for our lending operations  as well as a potential source of fee income 
we intend to build a diversified balance sheet to position us as a full service community bank that offers both retail and commercial loan and deposit products to all markets within the i corridor and the adjacent and other markets resulting from our acquisitions of ncb  mcb  and fnb 
moreover  we expect that the high level of customer service and expanded product offerings we provide  as well as our capital strength and financial position in an otherwise distressed banking market  will also facilitate organic growth and an opportunity to increase market share 
provide quality customer service and convenience 
in order to proactively address the needs of our clients  we continue to make and build out investments in infrastructure and technology to improve transactional efficiencies and minimize the amount of time required for customers to complete regular banking activities  such as making a deposit at a branch drive thru 
in addition  the customer experience is enhanced for in branch transactions as unique amenities such as child friendly 
table of contents play areas  coffee cafes and change counters combine banking activities with everyday realities 
to further emphasize convenience for our customers  we offer extended hours at the majority of our offices and alternative banking delivery systems  such as internet banking  that allow customers to pay bills  transfer funds and monitor account balances at any time 
additionally  we strive to create tailored products and services that are designed to meet the changing needs of our customers  such as our rewards checking program discussed under the heading item i  business sources of funds 
maintain strong asset quality 
we emphasize a disciplined credit culture based on intimate market knowledge  close ties to our customers  sound underwriting standards and experienced loan officers 
while the challenging operating environment which began a few years ago contributed to an increase in problem assets  management s primary objective has been to expeditiously reduce the level of nonperforming and classified assets through diligent monitoring and aggressive resolution efforts  including problem covered assets of ncb  mcb and fnb 
the results of this effort are evidenced by our asset quality at september   with million of non performing assets not covered by loss sharing which represented of total non covered assets 
this is compared to million  or of total non covered assets  and million  or of total non covered assets  of non performing assets not covered by loss sharing at september  and september   respectively 
our ratio of allowance for loan losses to non covered non performing loans was at september  we have established a dedicated problem asset resolution team with experienced leadership to resolve nonperforming assets and classified assets acquired in the ncb  mcb and fnb transactions 
while the majority of these nonperforming assets do not pose a significant credit risk because they are substantially covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic  reducing the amount of contractually non performing assets acquired in the ncb  mcb and fnb acquisitions will reduce the cost of carrying these assets 
covered loans are generally considered accruing and performing loans as the loans accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan when cash flows are reasonably estimable 
accordingly  covered loans that are contractually past due are still considered to be accruing and performing loans 
see asset quality for additional detail 
focus on relationship driven banking 
we are focused on meeting the financial needs of our customer base through offering a full complement of loan  deposit and online banking solutions ie internet banking and mobile banking 
over the years we have introduced new products and services in order to more fully serve and deepen the relationship with customers which has enabled us to grow our core deposit base  which generally represents a customer s primary banking relationship 
our quality customer relationships and core competencies provide opportunities for cross selling products to existing customers in an effort to deepen our share of wallet and we intend to actively develop such opportunities 
scalable operating platform 
we have committed significant resources to establish a scalable platform to accommodate future growth 
the investments made thus far in systems and personnel will enable us to achieve improved operational efficiencies  with minimal additional investments  as we continue to integrate the assets and liabilities from recent acquisitions 
in particular  our investment in operations required to integrate and manage the assets and liabilities acquired in fdic assisted transactions are largely fixed  allowing us to leverage existing systems and personnel to drive a higher return on similar investments in the future 
our acquisitions of ncb in june  mcb in march  and fnb in september highlight our ability to capitalize on opportunities that offer attractive risk adjusted returns and provide a template for future acquisitions 
we have closed branch locations  nine of which were acquired in fdic acquisitions  since as part of efforts to improve operational efficiency and will continue to focus our attention on other initiatives to increase franchise value

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following are the accounting policies that we believe are critical 
for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that become uncollectible  based on evaluations of the collectability of loans 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  historical loss rates  
table of contents overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a borrower s ability to repay 
we segment our allowance for loan losses into the following three major categories general allowances for classified watch loans  general allowances for loans with satisfactory ratings  and an unallocated amount 
risk ratings are initially assigned in accordance with our loan and collection policy 
a department independent from our loan origination staff reviews risk grade assignments on an ongoing basis 
management reviews current information and events regarding a borrowers financial condition and strengths  cash flows available for debt repayment  the related collateral supporting the loan and the effects of known and expected economic conditions 
when the evaluation reflects a greater than normal risk associated with the individual loan  management classifies the loan accordingly 
if the loan is determined to be impaired  management allocates a portion of the allowance for loan losses for that loan based on the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is considered collateral dependent  as the measure for the amount of the impairment 
impaired and classified watch loans are aggressively monitored 
the allowances for loans by credit grade are further subdivided by loan type 
we have developed specific quantitative allowance factors to apply to each loan grade which considers loan charge off experience over the most recent two years by loan type 
in addition  we apply loss estimates for certain qualitative allowance factors that are subjective in nature and require considerable judgment on the part of management 
such qualitative factors include economic and business conditions  the column of past due loans  changes in the value of collateral in collateral dependent loans  and other economic uncertainties 
an unallocated component of the allowance is also for losses that specifically exist in the remainder of the portfolio  but have yet to be identified 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions or changes in accounting guidance on reserves 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
at september   we had of our total non covered loan portfolio secured by real estate  with one to four family residential mortgage loans comprising of the total non covered loan portfolio  commercial real estate loans comprising of the total non covered loan portfolio  and construction loans comprising of the total non covered loan portfolio 
we carefully monitor our commercial real estate loans since the repayment of these loans is generally dependent upon earnings from the collateral real estate or the liquidation of the real estate and is affected by national and local economic conditions 
for many owner occupied commercial real estate loans  debt service may be dependent upon cash flow from business operations 
the residential category represents those loans we choose to maintain in our portfolio rather than selling into the secondary market 
the residential loans held for sale category comprises loans that are in the process of being sold into the secondary market 
the credit has been approved by the investor and the interest rate and purchase price fixed so we take no credit or interest rate risk with respect to these loans 
relating to the fdic assisted acquisitions of the loans of ncb  mcb  and fnb  we have established an allowance for loan losses for loans covered by loss sharing agreements and such allowance for loan losses was million at september  management believes this allowance for covered loans is adequate 
through the fdic assisted acquisitions of the loans of ncb  mcb  and fnb  we established nonaccretable discounts for the acquired impaired loans and we also established nonaccretable discounts for all other loans of mcb 
these nonaccretable discounts were based on estimates of future cash flows 
subsequent to the acquisition dates  we continue to assess the experience of actual cash flows on a quarterly basis compared to our estimates 
when we determine that nonaccretable discounts are insufficient to cover expected losses in the applicable covered loan portfolios  an allowance for covered loans is recorded with a corresponding provision for covered loan losses as a charge to earnings and an increase in the applicable fdic receivable based on additional future cash expected to be received from the fdic due to loss sharing indemnification 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and the establishment of a new cost basis for that security 
in connection with the assessment for other than temporary impairment of investment securities  mortgage backed securities  and collateralized mortgage obligations  management obtains fair value estimates by independent quotations  assesses current credit ratings and related trends  reviews relevant delinquency and default information  assesses expected cash flows and coverage ratios  reviews average credit score data of underlying mortgages  and assesses other current data 
the severity and duration of an impairment and the likelihood of potential recovery of an impairment is considered along with the intent and ability to hold any impaired security to maturity or recovery of carrying value 
see risk factors we could record future losses on our securities portfolio in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 

table of contents real estate owned 
real estate acquired through foreclosure  consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  is reported on an individual asset basis at the lower of cost or fair value  less disposal costs 
fair value is determined on the basis of current appraisals  comparable sales  and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources 
when properties are acquired through foreclosure  any excess of the loan balance at the time of foreclosure over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is recognized and charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent write downs are charged to a separate allowance for losses pertaining to real estate owned  established through provisions for estimated losses on real estate owned which are charged to expense 
based upon management s evaluation of the real estate acquired through foreclosure  additional expense is recorded when necessary in an amount sufficient to reflect any declines in estimated fair value 
gains and losses recognized on the disposition of the properties are recorded in noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets include costs in excess of net assets acquired and deposit premiums recorded in connection with the acquisitions 
in accordance with accounting requirements  we test our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as circumstances and events may warrant 
no impairment charges have been recognized through september  deferred income taxes 
management estimates income tax expense using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the amount of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases 
in estimating the liabilities and corresponding expense related to income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of various tax positions considering statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance 
because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations  interpretation is difficult and subject to differing judgments 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
management s determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income  reversing temporary differences which may offset  and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management has determined that no valuation allowances were necessary relating to the realization of its deferred tax assets 
changes in the estimate of income tax liabilities occur periodically due to changes in actual or estimated future tax rates and projections of taxable income  interpretations of tax laws  the complexities of multi state income tax reporting  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and the impact of newly enacted legislation or guidance as well as income tax accounting pronouncements 
receivable from fdic under loss sharing agreements 
under loss sharing agreements with the fdic  we recorded a receivable from the fdic equal to percent or percent  as applicable  of the estimated losses in the covered loans and other real estate acquired in an fdic assisted transaction 
the receivable was recorded at the present value of the estimated cash flows at the date of the acquisition and is reviewed and updated prospectively as loss estimates related to covered loans and other real estate acquired through foreclosure change 
most third party expenses on other acquired real estate and covered impaired loans are covered under the loss sharing agreements and the cash flows from the reimbursable portion are included in the estimate of the fdic receivable when incurred 
estimation of fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to certain of our assets  including investment securities available for sale  other real estate owned  assets and liabilities subject to acquisition accounting and the value of loan collateral for impaired loans 
these are all recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  generally accepted accounting principles require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  liquidity considerations  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
for additional information relating to the fair value of our financial instruments  see note fair value of financial instruments and fair value measurement in the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of financial condition at september  and assets 
total assets increased million  or  to billion at september   compared to billion at september  assets increased primarily due to increases of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in securities available for sale  partially offset by a decline in total loans of million 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at september   up from million at september  this increase was primarily due to an increase in interest earning deposits in other financial institutions from the net proceeds of our conversion and stock offering completed on april  loans 
at september   total loans were million  or of total assets 
during the year ended september   our total loan portfolio decreased by million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction of balances of acquired loan portfolios covered by loss sharing agreements  which was partially offset by an increase of million  or  in loans not covered by loss sharing agreements 
of the million in net loans as of september   million were covered by fdic loss sharing agreements

there were no other than temporary impairment charges in we review our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment 
in addition to management s intent and ability to hold the investments to maturity or recovery of carrying value  the review for impairment includes analyzing the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been lower than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer 
our review of mortgage securities includes loan geography  loan to value ratios  credit scores  types of loans  loan vintage  credit ratings  loss coverage from tranches less senior than our investment tranche and cash flow analysis 
our investments are evaluated using our best estimate of future cash flows 
if  based on our estimate of cash flows  we determine that an adverse change has occurred  other than temporary impairment would be recognized for the credit loss 
at september   we held one private label security which had a cumulative  other than temporary impairment charge recorded in prior years

we analyze our non agency collateralized mortgage securities for other than temporary impairment at least quarterly 
we use a multi step approach using bloomberg analytics considering market price  ratings  ratings changes  and underlying mortgage performance including delinquencies  foreclosures  deal structure  underlying collateral losses  prepayments  loan to value ratios  credit scores  and loan structure and underwriting  among other factors 
we apply the bloomberg default model  and if the bond shows no losses we consider it not other than temporarily impaired 
if a bond shows losses or a break in yield with the bloomberg default model  we create a probable vector of loss severities and defaults and if it shows a loss we consider it other than temporarily impaired 
cash flow analysis indicates that the yields on all of the private label securities noted above are maintained 
the unrealized losses may relate to general market liquidity and  in the securities with the larger unrealized losses  weakness in the underlying collateral  market concerns over foreclosure levels  and geographic concentration 
we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary impairment losses primarily because cash flow analysis indicates that there are continued sufficient levels of credit enhancements and credit coverage levels of less senior tranches 
as of september   the private label securities were classified as available for sale and a  other than temporary impairment charge had been recorded in prior periods 
based on the analysis performed by management as of september   we deemed it probable that all contractual principal and interest payments other than the single security identified above as being other than temporarily impaired  will be collected and therefore there is no other than temporary impairment

these reports include information on delinquent loans and foreclosed real estate  and our actions and plans to cure the delinquent status of the loans and to dispose of the foreclosed property

one position on the committee  the chairman  is permanent  and the other two positions alternate between four outside directors 
we generally stop accruing interest income when we consider the timely collectability of interest or principal to be doubtful 
we generally stop accruing for loans that are days or more past due unless the loan is well secured and we determine that the ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt 
when we designate loans as nonaccrual  we reverse all outstanding interest that we had previously credited 
these loans remain on nonaccrual status until a regular pattern of timely payments is established 
impaired loans are individually assessed to determine whether the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows to be received 
smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold 
when real estate is acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure  it is recorded at the lower of the related loan balance or its fair value as determined by an appraisal  less estimated costs of disposal 
if the value of the property is less than the loan  less any related specific loan loss reserve allocations  the difference is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
any subsequent write down of real estate owned or loss at the time of disposition is charged against earnings 
management has taken several steps to resolve the nonperforming and classified assets acquired in the ncb  mcb  and fnb transactions  including the following established a special assets department with experienced leadership that continues to actively manage the nonperforming and classified assets acquired in the fdic assisted transactions 

table of contents senior management reviews and updates resolution strategy quarterly  updates appraisals periodically  has an external appraisal review and validates expected cash flow through any other sources available 
through september   we had received million from the fdic for reimbursements associated with the fdic loss sharing agreements 
we have a remaining indemnification asset of million of which million is related to the ncb acquisition for which the loss share reimbursement period ends june as of september  our nonperforming assets not covered by loss sharing totaled million  or of total assets not covered by loss sharing 
real estate owned covered by loss sharing totaled million 
loans covered by loss sharing were performing as anticipated due to the discount accretion and therefore are considered performing  however  million of these covered loans are contractually delinquent 
we are also continuing to review the ncb  mcb and fnb loan portfolios with the objective of aggressively classifying all loans appropriately so that resolution plans can be established and delinquent assets can be returned to performing status 
non performing assets 
the table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non covered non performing assets at the dates indicated

loss sharing agreements cover any losses upon disposition of such assets at either or 

table of contents non performing assets not covered by loss share declined million during the year ended september  due to a decrease of  in commercial real estate owned not covered by loss share  a decrease of  in non performing one to four family residential real estate not covered by loss share and a decrease of  in one to four family residential real estate loans that are delinquent days or greater and still accruing 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in one to four family residential real estate owned not covered by loss share and a  increase in non performing commercial real estate not covered by loss share 
we have non covered loans that remain non performing at september   and the largest non performing non covered loan had a balance of  at september  and was secured by commercial real estate 
for the years ended september  and  interest income recognized on such loans for the years ended september  and was  and  respectively 
additional gross interest income that would have been recorded had our non accruing non covered loans been current in accordance with their original terms was  and  respectively 
troubled debt restructurings 
loans are classified as restructured when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers 
we only restructure loans for borrowers in financial difficulty that have presented a viable business plan to fully pay off all obligations  including outstanding debt  interest  and fees  either by generating additional income from the business or through liquidation of assets 
generally  these loans are restructured to provide the borrower additional time to execute upon their plans 
the concessions granted on troubled debt restructurings generally include terms to reduce the interest rate or extend the term of the debt obligation 
loans on nonaccrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings 
at september   we had  in nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings 
loans on accruing status at the date of concession are initially classified as accruing troubled debt restructurings if the loan is reasonably assured of repayment and performance is expected in accordance with its modified terms 
at september   we had million in accruing troubled debt restructurings 
such loans may be designated as nonaccrual loans subsequent to the concession date if reasonable doubt exists as to the collection of interest or principal under the restructuring agreement 
troubled debt restructurings are returned to accruing status when there is economic substance to the restructuring  there is documented credit evaluation of the borrower s financial condition  the remaining balance is reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with its modified terms  and the borrower has demonstrated sustained repayment performance in accordance with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time generally a minimum of six months 
as of september   no loans that were modified as troubled debt restructurings within the previous twelve months defaulted after their restructure

our policies  consistent with regulatory guidelines  provide for the classification of loans considered to be of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful  or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible so that their continuance 
table of contents as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets that do not expose the savings institution to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but which possess some weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention 
nonperforming non covered loans at september  balance in thousands we regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
we regularly monitor the value of underlying collateral on classified and nonperforming loans 
this monitoring involves physical site inspection  consultation with real estate professionals  our knowledge of our markets  and assessing appraisal trends 
potential problem loans are non covered loans as to which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present repayment terms 
management classifies potential problem loans as either special mention or substandard 
potential problem loans aggregated million and million at september  and  respectively  with million and million classified special mention and million and million classified substandard 
the following table sets forth the aggregate amount of our classified assets at the dates indicated 
classified assets as of september   and have been divided into those assets that were acquired in connection with the ncb  mcb and fnb transactions and are covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic  and those assets that are not covered by the loss sharing agreements

covered assets represent only the portion of the asset that is not covered by fdic loss sharing agreements 
the remaining portion of the covered assets is not shown because they are covered by fdic loss sharing agreements  and therefore cannot be considered classified assets 
our largest substandard loan relationship at september  was an million loan relationship 
as of september   all loans in the relationship are current and interest and taxes due have been paid 
the loan relationship is collateralized by income producing properties in alabama and was recently strengthened by the borrower pledging additional collateral 
we believe we are adequately collateralized  even at lower current real estate values 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable loan losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans with particular emphasis on impaired  non accruing  past due and other loans that management believes require special attention 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy 

table of contents additions to the allowance for loan losses are made periodically to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision for loan losses is determined by an evaluation of the level of loans outstanding  loss risk as determined based on a loan grading system  the level of non performing loans  historical loss experience  delinquency trends  the amount of losses charged to the allowance in a given period  and an assessment of economic conditions 
management believes the current allowance for loan losses is adequate based on its analysis of the losses in the portfolio 
during  we did not make significant changes to our methodology for determining the loan loss allowance 
our allowance for loan loss methodology is a loan classification based system 
our allowance for loan losses is segmented into the following four major categories specific reserves  general allowances for classified watch loans  general allowances for loans with satisfactory ratings  and an unallocated amount 
we base the required reserve on a percentage of the loan balance for each type of loan and classification level 
loans may be classified manually and are automatically classified if they are not previously classified when they reach certain levels of delinquency 
unclassified loans are reserved at different percentages based on our loan loss history for the last two years 
reserve percentages are also adjusted based upon our estimate of the effect that the current economic environment will have on each type of loan 
we have no loans for which there is known information about possible credit problems of borrowers that causes management to have serious doubts about their ability to comply with present loan repayment terms that are not currently disclosed as non accrual  past due  classified  underperforming  restructured or potential problem 
as of september  and  allowances of million and million  respectively  had been established for loan losses on covered loans acquired in the ncb transaction 
in addition  and million in allowances had been established for expected losses incurred on fnb loans as of september  and  respectively 
the nonaccretable discounts for covered loans amounted to million and million at september  and  respectively 
no allowance was established for loans acquired in the mcb or fnb acquisition at the time of acquisition as accounting standards prohibit carrying over an allowance for loan losses for loans purchased in those acquisitions 
these loans were recorded at fair value through establishing nonaccretable discounts 
if credit deterioration is observed subsequent to the acquisition dates  such deterioration will be accounted for pursuant to our revised estimates of expected cash flows on covered loans and a provision for loan losses will be charged to earnings for our loss share with an increase to the fdic receivable for the fdic indemnification amount 
amounts expected to be recovered from the fdic under loss sharing agreements are separately disclosed as the fdic receivable 
the following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated

charterbank s primary regulator changed from the office of thrift supervision to the office of the comptroller of the currency during the latter part of the fiscal year 
the office of the comptroller of the currency s policy is for the immediate charge off of specific allowances on impaired loans  which increased our charge offs by million in does not include loans held for sale or deferred fees

the following tables set forth the allowance for loan losses for non covered loans allocated by loan category and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated 
loans covered by the loss sharing agreement with the fdic are excluded from the table 
an unallocated allowance is generally maintained in a range of to of the total allowance in recognition of the imprecision of the estimates 
in times of greater economic downturn and uncertainty  the higher end of this range is provided 
lower allocations in the real estate construction portfolio in the last two years reflected decreased nonperforming loans  decreased charge offs in the recent two year period  and improved credit quality of those loans 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories

our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  advances from the federal home loan bank  loan payments and prepayments  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations repayments and maturities and sales of loans and other securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
at september  and  we had access to immediately available funds of approximately million and million  respectively  including overnight funds  fhlb borrowing capacity and a federal reserve line of credit 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are subject to our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at september  at september   we had million in advances from the fhlb outstanding 
however  based on available collateral other than cash  million in additional advances would be available 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements 
at september   we had million of new loan commitments outstanding  and million of unfunded construction and development loans 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had million of unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and federal home loan bank advances 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before september  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities 
during the year ended september   we originated million of loans and purchased million of securities 
financing activities consist primarily of additions to deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we experienced a net decrease in total deposits of million for the year ended september  this decrease represented reductions in our time deposits 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 

table of contents liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank  which provides an additional source of funds 
federal home loan bank of atlanta advances decreased by million to million during the year ended september  federal home loan bank advances have been used primarily to fund loan demand and to purchase securities 
our current asset liability management strategy has been to pay off federal home loan bank of atlanta advances as cash is available and the advances mature 
cash receipts arising from payments on covered loans and loss sharing collections from the fdic are providing and are expected to continue to provide positive net cash flows in periods following the wholesale funding outflows 
charterbank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at september   charterbank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
charterbank is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines

as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by us 
we consider commitments to extend credit in determining our allowance for loan losses 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at september  the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments

gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk as a financial institution  we face risk from interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates affect both our level of income and expense on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates also affect the market value of all interest earning assets 
the primary goal of our interest rate risk management strategy is to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable interest rate risk profile 
we seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that  under changing interest rate scenarios  portfolio equity and net interest income remain within an acceptable range 
we have emphasized commercial real estate lending  and to a lesser extent  one to four family residential lending 
our sources of funds include retail deposits  federal home loan bank advances and wholesale deposits 
we employ several strategies to manage the interest rate risk inherent in our mix of assets and liabilities  including selling fixed rate mortgages we originate to the secondary market  generally on a servicing released basis  maintaining the diversity of our existing loan portfolio by originating commercial real estate and consumer loans  which typically have adjustable rates and shorter terms than residential mortgages  emphasizing investments with adjustable interest rates  maintaining fixed rate borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta  and increasing retail transaction deposit accounts  which typically have long durations 
changes in market interest rates have a significant impact on the repayment and prepayment of loans 
prepayment rates also vary due to a number of other factors  including the regional economy in the area where the loans were originated  seasonal factors  demographic changes  the assumability of the loans  related refinancing opportunities and competition 
we monitor interest rate 
table of contents sensitivity so that we can attempt to adjust our asset and liability mix in a timely manner and thereby minimize the negative effects of changing rates 
extension risk  or lower prepayments causing loans to have longer average lives  is our primary exposure to higher interest rates 
faster prepayment of loans and investing the funds from prepayments in mortgage loans and securities at lower interest rates results in a lower net interest income and is our primary exposure to declining market interest rates 
interest risk measurement 
we compute the amounts by which the difference between the present value of an institution assets and liabilities the institution net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
our simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis to measure the interest rate sensitivity of npv 
depending on current market interest rates we historically have estimated the economic value of these assets and liabilities under the assumption that interest rates experience an instantaneous and sustained increase of   or basis points  or a decrease of and basis points 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
given the current relatively low level of market interest rates  a npv calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points has not been prepared 
the table below sets forth  as of september   our calculation of the estimated changes in charterbank s net portfolio value that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve 
change in interest rates bp 
estimated npv 
estimated increase decrease in npv percentage change in npv npv ratio as a percent of present value of assets 

increase decrease in npv ratio as a percent or present value of assets 
dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the difference between the present value of an institution s assets and liabilities 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
the table above indicates that at september   in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net portfolio value 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net portfolio value 
additionally  our internal policy states that our minimum npv of estimated present value of assets and liabilities shall range from a low of for a basis point change in rates to for no change in interest rates 
as of september   we were in compliance with our board approved policy limits 
the effects of interest rates on net portfolio value and net interest income are not predictable 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  deposit run off  and prepayments  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in these computations 
although some assets and liabilities may have similar maturity or periods of repricing  they may react at different times and in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
after a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in making the calculations set forth above 
additionally  increased credit risk may result if our borrowers are unable to meet their repayment obligations as interest rates increase
