item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other as part of the continuing environmental investigation by federal  state  and local governments of waste disposal sites  we have entered into a number of settlement agreements requiring us to participate in the investigation and cleanup of a number of sites 
under the terms of such settlements and related agreements  we may be required to manage or perform one or more elements of a site cleanup  or to manage the entire remediation activity for a number of parties  and subsequently seek recovery of some or all of such costs from other potentially responsible parties prps 
in many cases  we do not know the ultimate costs of our settlement obligations at the time of entering into particular settlement agreements  and our liability accruals for our obligations under those agreements are often subject to significant management judgment on an ongoing basis 
those cost accruals are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our accounting policies set forth in the environmental matters section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we  and our subsidiaries  are defendants in various other legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
at december  and  our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for these legal actions of million and million  respectively 
these liabilities do not include costs associated with legal representation 
based on our analysis  and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation  we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business background our operations are concentrated in three business segments chlor alkali products  chemical distribution and winchester 
chlor alkali products and winchester are both capital intensive manufacturing businesses 
chlor alkali operating rates are closely tied to the general economy 
each segment has a commodity element to it  and therefore  our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment s business that is strictly commodity 
our chlor alkali products and chemical distribution businesses are commodity businesses where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large  global commodity market 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply demand  can be abrupt and significant and  given capacity in our chlor alkali products business  can lead to very significant changes in our overall profitability 
winchester also has a commodity element to its business  but a majority of winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance 
while competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important  it is not the only factor in product selection 
recent developments and highlights year ka steel acquisition on august   we acquired privately held ka steel  on a debt free basis  for million in cash  after receiving the final working capital adjustment of million 
the purchase price is still subject to certain post closing adjustments related to a contingent liability 
as of the date of acquisition  ka steel had cash and cash equivalents of million 
ka steel is one of the largest distributors of caustic soda in north america and manufacturers and sells bleach in the midwest 
as part of the acquisition  we expensed million of acquisition costs during for segment reporting purposes  ka steel comprises the newly created chemical distribution segment 
our results for the year ended december  include ka steel sales of million and million of segment income  which includes depreciation and amortization expense of million  primarily associated with the acquisition fair valuing of ka steel 
as a result of acquiring ka steel  we anticipate realizing approximately million of annual synergies at the end of three years 
these synergies include opportunities to sell additional volumes of products we produce such as caustic soda  bleach  hydrochloric acid and potassium hydroxide through ka steel and to optimize freight cost and logistics assets between chlor alkali products and ka steel 
also  under the terms of the acquisition  both parties agreed to make an election under section h of the us internal revenue code us irc that is expected to result in cash tax benefits to us that have a net present value of approximately million 
financing in august  we sold million of senior notes notes with a maturity of august  the notes were issued at par value 
interest will be paid semi annually beginning on february  the acquisition of ka steel was partially financed with proceeds of million  after expenses of million  from the notes 
in june  we redeemed million of industrial development and environmental improvement tax exempt bonds industrial revenue bonds due in we paid a premium of million to the bond holders  which was included in interest expense 
we also recognized a million deferred gain in interest expense related to the interest rate swaps  which were terminated in march  on these industrial revenue bonds 
in december  we repaid million due under the annual requirements of the sunbelt notes 
on april   we entered into a new million five year senior revolving credit facility  which replaced the million senior revolving credit facility and a million letter of credit facility 
the new credit facility will expire in april borrowing options and restrictive covenants are similar to those of our previous million senior revolving credit facility 
the million senior revolving credit facility includes a million letter of credit subfacility and a million canadian subfacility 
restructurings on december   our board of directors approved a plan to eliminate our use of mercury in the manufacture of chlor alkali products 
under the plan  the  tons of mercury cell capacity at our charleston  tn facility will be converted to  tons of membrane capacity capable of producing both potassium hydroxide and caustic soda 
the board of directors also approved a plan to reconfigure our augusta  ga facility to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda  while discontinuing chlor alkali manufacturing at this site 
we based our decision to convert and reconfigure on several factors 
first  during and we had experienced a steady increase in the number of customers unwilling to accept our products manufactured using mercury cell technology 
second  there was federal legislation passed in governing the treatment of mercury that significantly limits our recycling options after december  we concluded that exiting mercury cell technology production after represented an unacceptable future cost risk 
further  the conversion of the charleston  tn plant to membrane technology will reduce the electricity usage per ecu produced by approximately 
the decision to reconfigure the augusta  ga facility to manufacture bleach and distribute caustic soda removes the highest cost production capacity from our system 
mercury cell chlor alkali production at the augusta  ga facility was discontinued at the end of september  and the conversion at charleston  tn was completed in the second half of with the successful start up of two new membrane cell lines 
these actions reduced chlor alkali capacity by  tons 
the completion of these projects eliminates our chlor alkali production using mercury cell technology 
on november   we announced that we had made the decision to relocate the winchester centerfire pistol and rifle ammunition manufacturing operations from east alton  il to oxford  ms 
this relocation  when completed  is forecast to reduce winchester s annual operating costs by approximately million 
we expect the centerfire relocation project to generate winchester operating cost savings of million to million in consistent with this relocation decision we initiated an estimated million five year project  which includes approximately million of capital spending 
the state of mississippi and local governments have provided incentives which should offset approximately percent of the capital spending 
in october  we opened the new centerfire pistol and rifle production facility in oxford  ms and the pistol and rifle ammunition manufacturing equipment continues to be in the process of being relocated and started up 
during  approximately of winchester s pistol ammunition was manufactured in oxford  ms 
we currently expect to complete this relocation by the end of once completed  winchester expects to have the most modern centerfire ammunition production facility in north america 
our total restructuring charges for  and related to these actions were million  million and million  respectively 
the restructuring charges included write off of equipment and facility costs  acceleration of asset retirement obligations  employee severance and related benefit costs  non cash pension and other postretirement benefits curtailment charges  lease and other contract termination costs  employee relocation costs  and facility exit costs 
we expect to incur approximately million of additional restructuring charges associated with these actions through the end of other highlights in  chlor alkali products segment income was million  an increase of compared to segment income was higher than the prior year  as a result of higher product prices and the ownership of sunbelt for the full period 
these increases were partially offset by decreased chlorine and caustic soda volumes 
operating rates in chlor alkali products for and were 
our ecu netbacks of approximately were higher than the netbacks of approximately due to higher caustic soda prices partially offset by lower chlorine prices 
in the first quarter of  a caustic soda price increase was announced of per ton and a chlorine price increase was announced of per ton 
in the second quarter of  we announced an additional per ton caustic soda price increase 
in the third quarter of  an additional caustic soda price increase was announced of per ton 
finally  in the fourth quarter of  an additional caustic soda price increase was announced for per ton 
the fourth quarter of weakness in chlorine demand resulted in a chlorine price that declined from the third quarter level 
chlorine prices in our system have declined for six consecutive quarters and we expect an additional decline from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of the chlorine price decline in the fourth quarter of from the third quarter of was more than offset by improved caustic soda pricing 
in the fourth quarter  caustic soda prices in the olin system reached the highest level since the second quarter of as a result  ecu netbacks improved from approximately in the third quarter of to approximately in the fourth quarter of while the success of the fourth quarter caustic soda price increase is not yet known  we do not believe this caustic soda price increase will have a meaningful impact on our first quarter ecu netbacks 
as a result of the anticipated lower chlorine prices  we expect first quarter ecu netbacks to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter level 
winchester segment income was million in compared to million in the increase in segment income compared to last year reflects the impact of higher selling prices and increased volumes  partially offset by higher operating costs and incremental costs associated with our ongoing relocation of the centerfire operations to oxford  ms 
other operating income in included million of insurance recoveries for business interruption related to an outage of one of our chlor alkali customers in the first half of income before taxes for and included million and million  respectively  of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
income tax expense for included million of tax benefits associated with the agricultural chemicals security tax credit under section o of the us irc section o  which were partially offset by million of tax expense associated with remeasurement of deferred taxes  changes in tax contingencies and tax expense associated with previously undistributed earnings from our winchester australia limited subsidiary 
income tax expense for included million of adjustments associated with a remeasurement of deferred taxes due to an increase in state tax effective rates  the expiration of statutes of limitation in federal and state jurisdictions  and the finalization of our domestic and canadian income tax returns 
income tax expense for also included a discrete deferred tax expense of million related to the tax effect of the gain recorded on the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in sunbelt 
capital spending of million for included million for the conversion of our charleston  tn facility from mercury cell technology to membrane technology  million for the construction of low salt  high strength bleach facilities at our mcintosh  al  henderson  nv  and niagara falls  ny chlor alkali sites and million for our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations 
the conversion of our charleston  tn facility was completed in the second half of with the successful start up of two new membrane cell lines and we also completed low salt  high strength bleach facilities at mcintosh  al and niagara falls  ny in the first and third quarters of  respectively 
year sunbelt acquisition on february   we acquired polyone s interest in sunbelt for million in cash plus the assumption of a polyone guarantee related to the sunbelt notes 
with this acquisition  olin now owns of sunbelt 
the sunbelt chlor alkali plant  which is located within our mcintosh  al facility  has approximately  tons of membrane technology capacity 
we also agreed to a three year earn out  which has no guaranteed minimum or maximum  based on the performance of sunbelt 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we consolidated the sunbelt notes with a fair value of million for the remaining principal balance of million as of february  during  our consolidated results included million of sunbelt sales and million of additional sunbelt pretax income million included in chlor alkali products segment income  less million of acquisition costs  million of interest expense and million of expense for our earn out liability on the interest we acquired 
finally  the results included a one time pretax  non cash gain of million associated with the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in sunbelt 
in conjunction with this remeasurement  a discrete deferred tax expense of million was recorded 
other highlights in  chlor alkali products segment income was million  which more than doubled compared with chlor alkali products segment income included million of additional income from the acquisition of the remaining interest in sunbelt 
chlor alkali products also realized improved product prices for compared to operating rates in chlor alkali products for and were and  respectively 
the combination of planned multi month outages by two chlorine customers and a weakening of chlorine demand negatively impacted shipment volumes in our ecu netbacks of approximately were higher than the netbacks of approximately in the first quarter of  three caustic soda price increases were announced totaling per ton 
in march  we also announced a per ton chlorine price increase 
in the third quarter of  an additional caustic soda price increase was announced for per ton  which replaced a late second quarter announced caustic soda price increase of per ton 
finally  in the fourth quarter of  an additional caustic soda price increase was announced for per ton 
the fourth quarter ecu netbacks were approximately  which was the first decline in price since the low point in our system in the third quarter of ecu netbacks in the fourth quarter declined slightly from the third quarter levels of approximately as chlorine prices weakened  driven by a reduced level of chlorine demand  which more than offset increases in caustic soda prices 
winchester segment income was million in compared to million in the winchester segment income declined from the surge levels of and the decrease in compared to reflected the impact of higher commodity metals and other material costs  higher manufacturing costs and incremental costs associated with our ongoing relocation of the centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations to oxford  ms  partially offset by higher selling prices 
other operating income for included a gain of million on the sale of a former manufacturing site and million of insurance recoveries related to our oxford  ms and st 
gabriel  la facilities 
income before taxes for and included million and million  respectively  of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods

income tax expense for also included a discrete deferred tax expense of million related to the tax effect of the gain recorded on the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in sunbelt 
income tax expense for included million of favorable adjustments associated with the expiration of statutes of limitation in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and a reduction in expense related to the release of a valuation allowance recorded against the foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset generated by our canadian operations 
in december  we repaid the million senior notes notes issued in  and million due under the annual requirements of the sunbelt notes 
these were redeemed using cash 
also during december  we drew the remaining million of variable rate go zone bonds that were issued in the associated cash was classified as a restricted long term asset 
on december   there was a million restricted cash balance that is required to be used to fund capital projects in alabama  mississippi  and tennessee 
capital spending of million for included million for our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations and million for the conversion of our charleston  tn facility from mercury cell technology to membrane technology 
the capital spending for the ongoing winchester relocation of million was partially financed by million of grants received by the state of mississippi and local governments 
the full amounts of these grants were received in the capital spending also included million for the construction of low salt  high strength bleach facilities at our mcintosh  al  henderson  nv  and niagara falls  ny chlor alkali sites 
year in  chlor alkali products segment income was million  a decrease of compared with chlor alkali products began to experience improved chlorine and caustic soda demand during and experienced an increased level of bleach sales 
volumes for chlorine and caustic soda improved compared to  while volumes for bleach improved 
operating rates in chlor alkali products for and were and  respectively 
our ecu netbacks of approximately were lower than the netbacks of approximately  however  the pricing trend was positive throughout as ecu netbacks increased sequentially from the low level of approximately in the third quarter of the fourth quarter of ecu netbacks were approximately as business conditions improved throughout  our quarterly chlor alkali operating rates improved year over year reaching a operating rate during the summer demand season 
a significant portion of the north american chlor alkali demand improvement came from exports of products made from chlorine  driven by the energy advantage the north american chemical producers enjoy by using natural gas as compared to crude oil 
with demand for both chlorine and caustic soda improving  price increases were announced throughout the year 
during february  an per ton caustic soda price increase was announced 
we began realizing a portion of this price increase in caustic soda in the second quarter of caustic soda demand continued to improve  and as a result  during the third quarter of  three additional caustic soda price increases were announced totaling per ton 
we began realizing the benefits from these price increases and from contracts that re set on an annual basis in the first half of winchester segment income of million in  which represented the second highest level of segment income in at least the last two decades  declined compared to segment income of million 
the higher than normal levels of commercial demand that began in the fourth quarter of continued through the second quarter of beginning with the third quarter of  winchester began to experience a decline in commercial demand from the levels 
however  the second half of commercial demand remained stronger than levels 
commercial volumes  excluding rimfire  for decreased approximately from levels 
income before taxes for included million of recoveries from third parties for environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
income tax expense for included million of favorable adjustments associated with the expiration of statutes of limitation in domestic and foreign jurisdictions and a reduction in expense related to the release of a valuation allowance recorded against the foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset generated by our canadian operations 
in september  we redeemed industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with maturity dates of february and march we paid a premium of million to the bond holders  which was included in interest expense 
we also recognized a million deferred gain in interest expense related to the interest rate swaps  which were terminated in april  on these industrial revenue bonds 
in october  we redeemed additional industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with a maturity date of october in october  we completed a financing of go zone and recovery zone tax exempt bonds totaling million due we had the option to borrow up to the entire million in a series of draw downs through december  during  we drew million of these bonds 
the proceeds from these bonds are required to be used to fund capital project spending at our mcintosh  al facility 
in december  we completed a financing of recovery zone tax exempt bonds totaling million due in and during  we drew the entire million of the bonds 
the proceeds from the bonds are required to be used to fund the charleston  tn facility mercury cell conversion and our ongoing winchester relocation 
of the million drawn from the go zone and recovery zone bonds as of december   million of the associated cash was classified as a noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash  until such time as we could request reimbursement of qualifying amounts used to fund the capital projects in alabama  mississippi and tennessee 
the patient protection and affordable healthcare act was signed into law on march  and the healthcare and education reconciliation act of was signed into law on march  collectively the healthcare acts 
the impact of the healthcare acts did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and chlor alkali products pricing in accordance with industry practice  we calculate chlor alkali products prices on an ecu netbacks basis  reporting and analyzing prices net of the cost of transporting the products to customers to allow for a comparable means of price comparisons between periods and with respect to our competitors 
for purposes of determining our ecu netbacks  we use prices that we realize as a result of sales of chlorine and caustic soda to our customers  and we do not include the value of chlorine and caustic soda that is incorporated in other products that we manufacture and sell 
quarterly and annual average ecu netbacks for   and were as follows  which include sunbelt ecu netbacks subsequent to february first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter annual average as business conditions improved throughout  our quarterly chlor alkali operating rates improved year over year reaching a operating rate during the summer demand season

the new law changes the mechanism for determining interest rates to be used for calculating minimum defined benefit pension plan funding requirements 
interest rates are determined using an average of rates of a year period  which can have the effect of increasing the annual discount rate  reducing the defined benefit pension plan obligation  and potentially reducing or eliminating the minimum annual funding requirement 
the new law also increased premiums paid to the pbgc 
based on our plan assumptions and estimates  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan at least through and under the new law may not be required to make any additional contributions for at least the next five years

outlook net income in the first quarter of is projected to be in the to per diluted share range compared with per diluted share in the first quarter of in chlor alkali products  the first quarter of segment earnings are expected to decrease compared with the first quarter of earnings of million 
the expected decline in segment earnings anticipates lower ecu netbacks and lower chlorine and caustic soda shipment volumes 
the fourth quarter of weakness in chlorine demand resulted in a chlorine price that declined from the third quarter level 
chlorine prices in our system have declined for six consecutive quarters and we expect an additional decline from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of the chlorine price decline in the fourth quarter of from the third quarter of was more than offset by improved caustic soda pricing 
in the fourth quarter  caustic soda prices in the olin system reached the highest level since the second quarter of as a result  ecu netbacks improved from approximately in the third quarter of to approximately in the fourth quarter of while the success of the fourth quarter caustic soda price increase is not yet known  we do not believe this caustic soda price increase will have a meaningful impact on our first quarter ecu netbacks 
as a result of the anticipated lower chlorine prices  we expect first quarter ecu netbacks to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter level 
chemical distribution first quarter segment earnings are expected to increase compared with the fourth quarter of earnings of million 
as a result of acquiring ka steel  we anticipate realizing approximately million of annual synergies at the end of three years and million to million of synergies in these synergies include opportunities to sell additional volumes of products we produce such as caustic soda  bleach  hydrochloric acid and potassium hydroxide through ka steel and to optimize freight cost and logistics assets between the chlor alkali products and ka steel businesses 
winchester first quarter segment earnings are expected to improve significantly compared with the first quarter of segment earnings of million 
higher commercial volumes and increased selling prices are forecast to positively impact the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of beginning around the time of the november presidential election  consumer purchases of ammunition surged significantly above normal demand levels 
the surge in demand has been across all of winchester s commercial product offerings 
the increase in commercial demand can be illustrated by the increase in winchester s commercial backlog  which was million at january  compared to million at december  and million at january  winchester anticipates that higher than normal levels of demand for its commercial customers will continue at least into the third quarter of winchester also anticipates that the price of commodity metals in will be comparable with in october  winchester opened the new centerfire pistol and rifle production facility in oxford  ms and the pistol and rifle ammunition manufacturing equipment continues to be in the process of being relocated and started up 
during  approximately of winchester s pistol ammunition was manufactured in oxford  ms 
this relocation  which is forecast to be completed in  is forecast to reduce winchester s annual operating costs by approximately million 
we expect the centerfire relocation project to generate winchester operating costs savings of million to million in we anticipate that charges for environmental investigatory and remedial activities will be in the million to million range 
we do not believe that there will be recoveries of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods in we expect defined benefit pension plan income in to be similar to the level 
based on our plan assumptions and estimates  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan in and under the new law  we may not be required to make any additional contributions for at least five years 
we do have a small canadian defined benefit pension plan to which we made contributions of million in both and  and we anticipate cash contributions of less than million in during the first quarter of  we are anticipating pretax restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily associated with our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations from east alton  il to oxford  ms and exiting the use of mercury cell technology in the chlor alkali manufacturing 
we are expecting total pretax restructuring charges for related to these projects to be approximately million 
we expect to incur additional restructuring charges through totaling approximately million related to our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations from east alton  il to oxford  ms 
in  we expect our capital spending to be in the million to million range  which includes spending for a low salt high strength bleach facility and a hydrochloric acid expansion project at our henderson  nv chlor alkali site and spending for our ongoing relocation of winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations

environmental matters years ended december  cash outlays receipts in millions remedial and investigatory spending charged to reserve recoveries from third parties capital spending plant operations charged to cost of goods sold total cash outlays cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
total environmental related cash outlays in increased compared to  primarily driven by decreased recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
total environmental related cash outlays in increased compared to  primarily driven by remedial and investigatory spending due to the implementation of a remedial action plan at a former waste disposal site in  partially offset by increased recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
total environmental related cash outlays for are estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts  approximately million on capital projects and approximately million on normal plant operations 
remedial and investigatory spending is anticipated to be lower in than due to completing a remedial action plan at a former waste disposal site in historically  we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects  and normal plant operations are expected to range between million to million over the next several years  million to million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts  which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental related cash outlays  there is always the possibility that such an increase may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
our liabilities for future environmental expenditures were as follows december  in millions beginning balance charges to income remedial and investigatory spending currency translation adjustments ending balance in the united states  the establishment and implementation of federal  state  and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use  and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances  and remediation of contaminated sites  has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs 
our canadian facility is governed by federal environmental laws administered by environment canada and by provincial environmental laws enforced by administrative agencies 
many of these laws are comparable to the us laws described above 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites 
we are party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages 
with respect to unasserted claims  we accrue liabilities for costs that  in our experience  we may incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims 
our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to million at december  with respect to asserted claims  we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation  feasibility study  remedial action and operation  maintenance and monitoring om m expenses that  in our experience  we may incur in connection with the asserted claims 
required site om m expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding years  which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long term site om m 
charges or credits to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in  and and may be material to operating results in future years 
environmental provisions charged credited to income  which are included in cost of goods sold  were as follows years ended december  in millions charges to income recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods total environmental expense these charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
our total estimated environmental liability at the end of was attributable to sites  of which were usepa national priority list npl sites 
ten sites accounted for of our environmental liability and  of the remaining sites  no one site accounted for more than of our environmental liability 
at seven of the ten sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long term om m stage 
at two of these ten sites  a remedial investigation is being performed 
the one remaining site is in long term om m 
all ten sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites 
none of the ten largest sites represents more than of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures 
our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   of which million and million  respectively  were classified as other noncurrent liabilities 
our environmental liability amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
of the million included on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures  we currently expect to utilize million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next years  million for expenditures to years in the future  and million for expenditures beyond years in the future 
these estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  as described in item a risk factors environmental costs 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps  our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we estimate it is reasonably possible that we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve 
legal matters and contingencies we  and our subsidiaries  are defendants in various legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
we describe some of these matters in item legal proceedings 
at december  and  our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for these legal actions of million and million  respectively 
these liabilities do not include costs associated with legal representation 
based on our analysis  and considering the inherent uncertainties associated with litigation  we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that these legal actions will materially adversely affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
during the ordinary course of our business  contingencies arise resulting from an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible gain contingency 
in certain instances such as environmental projects  we are responsible for managing the cleanup and remediation of an environmental site 
there exists the possibility of recovering a portion of these costs from other parties 
we account for gain contingencies in accordance with the provisions of asc contingencies asc and therefore do not record gain contingencies and recognize income until it is earned and realizable

the conversion of our charleston  tn facility was completed in the second half of with the successful start up of two new membrane cell lines 
we also completed low salt  high strength bleach facilities at mcintosh  al and niagara falls  ny in the first and third quarters of  respectively  and expect the remaining low salt  high strength facility at henderson  nv to be completed during the first quarter of these three new facilities will increase total bleach manufacturing capacity by an additional over capacity 
these low salt  high strength bleach facilities manufacture bleach with approximately twice the concentration  which should significantly reduce transportation costs 
in  we expect our capital spending to be in the million to million range  which includes spending for a low salt  high strength bleach facility and a hydrochloric acid expansion project at our henderson  nv chlor alkali site and spending for our ongoing relocation of winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations

liquidity and other financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  cash flow from operations  and short term borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
additionally  we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations is variable as a result of both the seasonal and the cyclical nature of our operating results  which have been affected by seasonal and economic cycles in many of the industries we serve  such as the vinyls  urethanes  bleach  ammunition and pulp and paper 
the seasonality of the ammunition business  which is typically driven by the fall hunting season  and the seasonality of the vinyls and bleach businesses  which are stronger in periods of warmer weather  typically cause working capital to fluctuate between million to million over the course of the year 
cash flow from operations is affected by changes in ecu selling prices caused by the changes in the supply demand balance of chlorine and caustic soda  resulting in the chlor alkali business having significant leverage on our earnings and cash flow 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant and internal consumption remains approximately the same  a per ecu selling price change equates to an approximate million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit when we are operating at full capacity 
for  cash provided by operating activities increased by million from  primarily due to higher earnings and a decrease in working capital in for  working capital decreased million compared to an increase of million in the decrease in was primarily due to decreased inventories of million  primarily at winchester 
the cash from operations was also impacted by a million decrease in cash tax payments 
capital spending was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
capital spending for and included million and million  respectively  for the conversion of our charleston  tn facility from mercury cell technology to membrane technology and million and million  respectively  for the construction of low salt  high strength bleach facilities at our mcintosh  al  henderson  nv and niagara falls  ny chlor alkali sites 
capital spending for and also included million and million  respectively  for our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations 
the capital spending for the ongoing winchester relocation was partially financed by million of grants provided by the state of mississippi and local governments 
the full amounts of these grants were received in capital spending in included bleach manufacturing and bleach shipping by railroad expansion projects at three of our chlor alkali facilities 
capital spending was   and of depreciation in  and  respectively 
the conversion of our charleston  tn facility was completed in the second half of with the successful start up of two new membrane cell lines 
we also completed low salt  high strength bleach facilities at mcintosh  al and niagara falls  ny in the first and third quarters of  respectively  and expect the remaining low salt  high strength facility at henderson  nv to be completed during the first quarter of these three new facilities will increase total bleach manufacturing capacity by an additional over capacity 
these low salt  high strength bleach facilities manufacture bleach with approximately twice the concentration  which should significantly reduce transportation costs 
in  we expect our capital spending to be in the million to million range  which includes spending for a low salt high strength bleach facility and a hydrochloric acid expansion project at our henderson  nv chlor alkali site and spending for our ongoing relocation of winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations 
we expect the henderson  nv projects to be completed during the first half of the overall use of cash of million in primarily reflects the acquisition of ka steel and capital spending for the conversion of our charleston  tn facility  our low salt  high strength bleach facilities  and our ongoing relocation of our winchester centerfire ammunition manufacturing operations  partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
based on our december  unrestricted cash balance of million  the restricted cash balance of million  and the availability of approximately million of liquidity from our senior revolving credit facility  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our short term and long term needs 
additionally  we believe that we have access to the debt and equity markets 
on july   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million shares of common stock that will terminate in three years for any remaining shares not yet repurchased 
we purchased and retired million shares in and under this program  at a cost of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had purchased a total of million shares under this program and million shares remained authorized to be purchased 
the repurchases will be effected from time to time on the open market  or in privately negotiated transactions 
in august  we sold million of notes with a maturity date of august  the notes were issued at par value 
interest will be paid semi annually beginning on february  the acquisition of ka steel was partially financed with proceeds of million  after expenses of million  from these notes 
in june  we redeemed industrial revenue bonds totaling million with a maturity date of we paid a premium of million to the bond holders  which was included in interest expense 
we also recognized a million deferred gain in interest expense related to the interest rate swap  which was terminated in march  on these industrial revenue bonds 
pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated december   sunbelt sold million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series o  and million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series g 
we refer to these notes as the sunbelt notes 
the sunbelt notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on each june and december beginning on december  and each year through  sunbelt is required to repay million of the sunbelt notes  of which million is attributable to the series o notes and of which million is attributable to the series g notes

we also recognized a million deferred gain in interest expense related to the interest rate swaps  which were terminated in april  on these industrial revenue bonds 
in october  we redeemed additional industrial revenue bonds totaling million  with a maturity date of october on april   we entered into a new million five year senior revolving credit facility  which replaced the million senior revolving credit facility and a million letter of credit facility 
the new senior revolving credit facility will expire in april  at december   we had million available under our million senior revolving credit facility  because we had issued million of letters of credit under a million subfacility 
the new senior revolving credit facility also has a million canadian subfacility 
under the senior revolving credit facility  we may select various floating rate borrowing options

the facility includes various customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio and the ratio of earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense coverage ratio 
compliance with these covenants is determined quarterly based on the operating cash flows for the last four quarters 
we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under all our outstanding credit agreements as of december  and  and no event of default had occurred that would permit the lenders under our outstanding credit agreements to accelerate the debt if not cured 
in the future  our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows  among other factors  will determine the amounts available to be borrowed under these facilities 
as of december   there were no covenants or other restrictions that limited our ability to borrow 
at december   we had total letters of credit of million outstanding  of which million were issued under our million senior revolving credit facility

in conjunction with the st 
gabriel  la conversion and expansion project  which was completed in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a twenty year brine and pipeline supply agreement with petrologistics olefins  llc petrologistics 
petrologistics installed  owns and operates  at its own expense  a pipeline supplying brine to the st 
gabriel  la facility 
beginning november  we are obligated to make a fixed annual payment over the life of the contract of million for use of the pipeline  regardless of the amount of brine purchased 
we also have a minimum usage requirement for brine of million over the first five year period of the contract 
we have met or exceeded the minimum brine usage requirements since the inception of the contract 
after the first five year period  the contract contains a buy out provision exercisable by us for million 
our long term contractual commitments  including the on and off balance sheet arrangements  consisted of the following payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions debt obligations interest payments under debt obligations and interest rate swap agreements a contingent tax liability qualified pension plan contributions b non qualified pension plan payments postretirement benefit payments off balance sheet commitments noncancelable operating leases purchasing commitments raw materials capital expenditures utilities total a for the purposes of this table  we have assumed for all periods presented that there are no changes in the principal amount of any variable rate debt from the amounts outstanding on december  and that there are no changes in the rates from those in effect at december  which ranged from to 
b these amounts are only estimated payments assuming an annual expected rate of return on pension plan assets of  and a discount rate on pension plan obligations of 
these estimated payments are subject to significant variation and the actual payments may be more than the amounts estimated 
given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit pension plans  no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year 
based on the current funding requirements  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan at least through we do have a small canadian defined benefit pension plan to which we made million of cash contributions in and and we anticipate less than million of cash contributions in see discussion on moving ahead for progress in the st century act in pension plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item non cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs 
for losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable  we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the table above  we have various commitments and contingencies including defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans as described below  environmental matters see environmental matters included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and litigation claims see item legal proceedings 
we have several defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as described in the pension plans note in notes to consolidated financial statements in item we fund the defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate 
we have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees and their beneficiaries  as described in the postretirement benefits note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item these other postretirement plans are not pre funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred 
we also have standby letters of credit of million of which million have been issued through our senior revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million available under our senior revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability  environmental  restructuring and other unusual items  litigation  income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances  pension  postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
on january   we adopted accounting standards update asu testing goodwill for impairment asu  which permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test and are considered as part of the qualitative assessment that could trigger the two step impairment test include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate  a significant adverse legal judgment  adverse cash flow trends  an adverse action or assessment by a government agency  unanticipated competition  decline in our stock price  and a significant restructuring charge within a reporting unit 
we define reporting units at the business segment level or one level below the business segment  which for our chlor alkali products segment are the us operations and canadian operations 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit 
based upon our qualitative assessment  it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are greater than their carrying amounts as of december  no impairment charges were recorded for  or in and  prior to the adoption of asu  we used a discounted cash flow approach to develop the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
management judgment was required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
we also corroborated our discounted cash flow analysis by evaluating a market based approach that considers earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples from a representative sample of comparable public companies in the chemical industry 
an impairment would be recorded if the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value 
the discount rate  profitability assumptions  terminal growth rate and cyclical nature of our chlor alkali business were the material assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
the discount rate reflected a weighted average cost of capital  which was calculated based on observable market data 
some of these data such as the risk free or treasury rate and the pretax cost of debt were based on the market data at a point in time 
other data such as the equity risk premium were based upon market data over time for a peer group of companies in the chemical manufacturing industry with a market capitalization premium added  as applicable 
the discounted cash flow analysis required estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events 
our analysis used our internally generated long range plan 
our discounted cash flow analysis used the assumptions in our long range plan about terminal growth rates  forecasted capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit 
the long range plan reflects management judgment  supplemented by independent chemical industry analyses which provide multi year chlor alkali industry operating and pricing forecasts 
we believe the assumptions used in our goodwill impairment analysis are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the implied fair value of each reporting unit 
however  given the economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing  will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future 
if our assumptions regarding future performance are not achieved  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
environmental accruals charges to income for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these amounts  which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties  are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available 
environmental costs are capitalized if the costs increase the value of the property and or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations 
environmental costs and recoveries are included in costs of goods sold 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  changes in regulatory authorities  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
pension and postretirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by asc these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the financial impact of changes to the plan and actuarial assumptions over the average remaining service lives of the employees in the plan 
changes in liability due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  rate of compensation increases and mortality  as well as annual deviations between what was assumed and what was experienced by the plan are treated as gains or losses 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their average remaining service lives on a relatively smooth basis and  therefore  the accounting for benefits earned under the pension or non pension postretirement benefits plans should follow the same relatively smooth pattern 
substantially all defined benefit pension plan participants are no longer accruing benefits  therefore  actuarial gains and losses are amortized based upon the remaining life expectancy of the inactive plan participants 
for the years ended december  and  the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants in the defined benefit pension plan was years 
one of the key assumptions for the net periodic pension calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  used to determine the market related value of assets 
the market related value of assets recognizes differences between the plan s actual return and expected return over a five year period 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on the market related value of plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and  therefore  result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
as differences between actual and expected returns are recognized over five years  they subsequently generate gains and losses that are subject to amortization over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive plan participants  as described in the preceding paragraph 
we use long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets  and future estimates of long term investment returns and inflation by reference to external sources to develop the expected long term rate of return on plan assets as of december the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments on december of each year 
the rate of compensation increase is based upon our long term plans for such increases 
for retiree medical plan accounting  we review external data and our own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions resulting from economic events 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease or increase in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the defined benefit pension plan income by approximately million 
holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have decreased pension income by million and increased the projected benefit obligation by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for and the projected benefit obligation as of december  would have increased pension income by million and decreased the projected benefit obligation by million

this update did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments asc derivatives and hedging asc required an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we use hedge accounting treatment for substantially all of our business transactions whose risks are covered using derivative instruments 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 
all derivatives recognized in earnings impact the expense line item on our consolidated statement of operations that is consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item 
we enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally canadian dollar and australian dollar 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december  and  we had no forward contracts to buy or sell foreign currencies 
we use cash flow hedges for certain raw material and energy costs such as copper  zinc  lead  electricity  and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials and energy costs used in our manufacturing process 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized as a component of other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized into earnings 
gains and losses on the derivatives representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized currently in earnings 
losses on settled futures contracts were million million  net of taxes in  which were included in cost of goods sold 
gains on settled futures contracts were million million  net of taxes  and million million  net of taxes in and  respectively  which were included in cost of goods sold 
at december   we had open positions in futures contracts through totaling million million 
if all open futures contracts had been settled on december   we would have recognized a pretax gain of million 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a gain  net of taxes  in fair value on commodity forward contracts of million 
if commodity prices were to remain at the levels they were at december   approximately million of deferred gains  net of tax  would be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months 
the actual effect on earnings will be dependent on commodity prices when the forecasted transactions occur 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss  net of taxes  in fair value on commodity forward contracts of million 
we use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on the hedge designation and whether the hedge is effective in offsetting changes in fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability being hedged 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings 
we include the gain or loss on the hedged items fixed rate borrowings in the same line item  interest expense  as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps 
as of december  and  the total notional amount of our interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges were zero and million  respectively 
in march  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates

we have agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement is also citibank 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized through as of december   million of this gain was included in long term debt 
in october  we de designated our million interest rate swaps that had previously been designated as fair value hedges 
the million variable interest rate swaps and the million fixed interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting

we have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks 
energy costs including electricity used in our chlor alkali products segment  and certain raw materials and energy costs  namely copper  lead  zinc  electricity  and natural gas used primarily in our winchester and chemical distribution segments are subject to price volatility 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into futures contracts and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
as of december   we maintained open positions on futures contracts totaling million million at december  
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  which are currently hedged  as of december   we would experience a million million at december  increase in our cost of inventory purchased  which would be substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities 
the effect of interest rates on investing activity is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our current debt structure is used to fund business operations  and commitments from banks under our senior revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million million at december  of which million million at december  was issued at variable rates 
in june  we terminated million of interest rate swaps with wells fargo that had been entered into on the sunbelt notes in may the result was a gain of million which will be recognized through as of december   million of this gain was included in long term debt 
in march  citibank terminated million of interest rate swaps on our industrial revenue bonds due in the result was a gain of million  which would have been recognized through in june  the industrial revenue bonds were redeemed by us  and as a result  the remaining million deferred gain was recognized in interest expense during in april  citibank terminated million of interest rate swaps on our industrial revenue bonds due in the result was a gain of million  which would have been recognized through in september  the industrial revenue bonds were redeemed by us  and as a result  the remaining million gain was recognized in interest expense in in march  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements is citibank 
in october  we entered into million of interest rate swaps with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes 
we have agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement is also citibank 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which will be recognized through as of december   million of this gain was included in long term debt 
in october  we de designated our million interest rate swaps that had previously been designated as fair value hedges 
the million variable interest rate swaps and the million fixed interest rate swaps do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
all changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are recorded currently in earnings 
in and  we entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying fixed rate debt obligations  whereby we agreed to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  paid us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements was citibank 
in january  we entered into a million fixed interest rate swap with equal and opposite terms as the million variable interest rate swaps on the notes 
we agreed to pay a fixed rate to a counterparty who  in turn  paid us variable rates 
the counterparty to this agreement was bank of america  a major financial institution 
the result was a gain of million on the million variable interest rate swaps  which was recognized through assuming no changes in the million of variable rate debt levels from december   we estimate that a hypothetical change of basis points in the libor interest rates from would impact annual interest expense by million 
the following table reflects the swap activity related to certain debt obligations underlying debt instrument swap amount date of swap december  in millions olin pays floating rate  due march a  due march a olin receives floating rate  due october a  due october a a actual rate is set in arrears 
we project the rate will fall within the range shown 
these interest rate swaps reduced interest expense by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the actual change in interest or commodities pricing is substantially different than expected  the net impact of interest rate risk or commodity risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
