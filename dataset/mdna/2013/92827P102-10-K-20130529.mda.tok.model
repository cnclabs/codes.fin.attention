business overview we are a global information technology services company 
we use an offshore delivery model to provide a broad range of it services  including it consulting  technology implementation and application outsourcing 
using our enhanced global delivery model  innovative platforming approach and industry expertise  we provide cost effective services that enable our clients to use it to enhance business performance  accelerate time to market  increase productivity and improve customer service 
headquartered in massachusetts  we have offices in the united states  the united kingdom  germany and 
table of contents singapore and global delivery centers in hyderabad  chennai and bangalore  india  colombo  sri lanka and budapest  hungary 
at march   we had  employees  or team members  an increase from  at march  for the fiscal year ended march   we had revenue of million and income from operations of million 
in our fiscal year ended march   our revenue increased by million  or  to million  as compared to million in our fiscal year ended march  our net income increased from million in our fiscal year ended march  to million in our fiscal year ended march  the key drivers of the increase in revenue in our fiscal year ended march   as compared to our fiscal year ended march   were as follows broad based revenue growth among our clients existing at march   particularly our top ten clients collectively broad based revenue growth from clients in our banking  financial services and insurance bfsi and media and information m i industries broad based growth in all geographies  led by north america and europe the key drivers of our increase in net income in our fiscal year ended march   as compared to our fiscal year ended march   were as follows higher revenue contribution from existing clients increased efficiencies partially offset by higher costs related to an increased percentage of onsite work  annual compensation increases  and an increased use of subcontractors further reduced by higher tax expense due to change in the geographical mix of profits high repeat business and client concentration are common in our industry 
during the fiscal year ended march   of our revenue was derived from clients who had been using our services for more than one year 
accordingly  our global account management and service delivery teams focus on expanding client relationships and converting new engagements to long term relationships to generate repeat revenue and expand revenue streams from existing clients 
we also have a dedicated business development team focused on generating engagements with new clients to continue to expand our client base and  over time  reduce client concentration 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  we generated   and  respectively  of revenue from application outsourcing and  and  respectively  of revenue from consulting services 
we perform our services under both time and materials and fixed price contracts 
revenue from fixed price contracts was   and of total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the revenue earned from fixed price contracts reflects our clients preferences during the fiscal years ended march   and at march   we had cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments of million as compared to million at march  the increase related primarily to our growth in income from operations 
for the fiscal year ending march   we expect the following factors  among others  to affect our business and our operating results global economic conditions continued uncertainty in overall demand for global it services foreign currency volatility impact of an increased effective income tax rate as a result of a higher tax rate in india and geographical mix of our profits 

table of contents for the fiscal year ending march   we plan to continue to invest in our talent base  including new onsite campus recruitment programs implement resource and operating optimization initiatives to improve operating efficiencies continue our focus on client acquisition and expansion of revenue gained from existing clients invest in healthcare regulatory compliance solutions as well as leverage our expertise in customer relations management and business process management deepen our domain expertise in our service offerings related to mobile applications  social media and cloud computing broaden our consulting and solutions capabilities related to our service offerings pursue opportunistic acquisitions that would improve or broaden our overall service delivery capabilities  domain expertise and or service offerings as an it services company  our revenue growth has been  and will continue to be  highly dependent on our ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain skilled it professionals 
for the fiscal year ended march   we finished the fiscal year with a total headcount of  as compared with a total headcount of  for the fiscal year ended march  there is intense competition for it professionals with the skills necessary to provide the type of services we offer 
we closely monitor our overall attrition rates and patterns to ensure our people management strategy aligns with our growth objectives 
for the last twelve months ended march   our voluntary attrition rate was  while our involuntary attrition rate was 
the majority of our attrition occurs in india and sri lanka  and is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff 
in response to higher attrition and as part of our retention strategies  we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs  which may continue in the future 
however  we try to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs  the mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies 
if our attrition rate increases or is sustained at higher levels  our growth may slow and our cost of attracting and retaining it professionals could increase 
we have continued to maintain a twelve quarter hedging program  which we believe has been effective since inception at reducing the impact of fluctuations in local currencies on our operating results  although there is no assurance that this hedging program will continue to be effective 
these hedges may also cause us to forego benefits of a positive currency fluctuation  especially given the volatility of these currencies 
in addition  to the extent that these hedges cease to qualify for hedge accounting  we may have to recognize gains or losses on the aggregate amount of hedges placed earlier than expected 
we monitor a number of operating metrics to manage and assess our earnings  including days sales outstanding dso is a measure of the number of days our accounts receivable are outstanding based upon the last days of revenue activity  which indicates the timeliness of our cash collection from clients and our overall credit terms to our clients 
dso was days and days as of march  and march   respectively 
higher dso reduces our cash balance because the revenue to cash conversion process takes longer 
realized billing rates are the rates we charge our clients for our services  which reflect the value our clients place on our services  market competition and the geographic location in which we perform our services 
our realized billing rates have marginally increased for our fiscal year ended march  as compared to our fiscal year ended march  any increase in realized billing rates is a result of our ability to successfully preserve or increase our billing rates with existing and or new clients 

table of contents average cost per it professional is the sum of team member salaries  including variable compensation  and fringe benefits  divided by the average number of it professionals during the period 
we experienced an increase in our average cost per it professional in asia from our fiscal year ended march  to our fiscal year ended march   primarily driven by competition 
utilization rate indicates the efficiency of our billable it resources 
our utilization rate is defined as the number of billable hours in a given period of time divided by the total number of available hours of our it professionals in a given period of time  excluding trainees 
we track our utilization rates to measure revenue potential and gross profit margins 
management targeted range for the utilization rate is between and 
the utilization rate is affected by the rate of quarterly sequential revenue growth  as well as ability to staff existing it professionals on billable engagements 
in growth periods  utilization tends to rise as more resources are deployed to meet rising demand 
utilization rates above the target may also indicate that there are insufficient it professionals to staff existing or future engagements which may result in loss of revenue or inability to service client engagements 
attrition rate is the ratio of terminated team members during the latest twelve months to the total number of team members at the end of such period  which measures team member turnover 
increased voluntary attrition rates result in increased hiring  training and on boarding costs and productivity losses  which may adversely affect our revenue  gross margin and operating profit margin 
our voluntary attrition rate was  while our involuntary attrition rate was  for the fiscal year ended march  our voluntary attrition rate was for the fiscal year ended march   while our involuntary attrition rate was for the same fiscal year 
operating expense efficiency is a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
if we continue to successfully grow our revenue  we anticipate that operating expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue as such expenses are absorbed across a larger revenue base 
in the near term  however  any operating expense efficiency may decline if our revenue declines 
effective tax rate is our worldwide tax expense as a percentage of our consolidated net income before tax  which measures the impact of income taxes worldwide on our operations and net income 
we monitor and assess our effective tax rate to evaluate whether our tax structure is competitive as compared to our industry 
our effective tax rate was and for the fiscal years ended march  and respectively 
our effective tax rate was impacted by the mix of income by jurisdiction  availability and term of certain tax holidays and settlement of uncertain tax positions identified during the fiscal year ended march  increases in our effective tax rate or a high effective tax rate will also have a negative effect on our earnings in future periods 
onsite to offshore mix is the measurement of hours billed by resources located offshore to hours billed by our team members onsite over a defined period 
we strive to manage both fixed price contracts and time and materials engagements to a targeted to onsite to offshore service delivery team mix  although such delivery mix may be impacted by several factors including our new and existing client delivery requirements as well as the impact of any acquisitions 
sources of revenue we generate revenue by providing it services to our clients located primarily in north america and europe 
we have historically earned  and believe that over the next few fiscal years we will continue to earn a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients 
for the fiscal year ended march   collectively  our five largest and ten largest clients accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
our three largest clients accounted for  and respectively  of our revenue for the fiscal year ended march  the loss of any one of our major clients could reduce our revenue and operating profit and harm our reputation in the industry 
during the fiscal year ended 
table of contents march   of our revenue was generated in north america  in europe and in rest of the world 
we provide it services on either a time and materials or a fixed price basis 
for the fiscal year ended march   the percentage of revenue from time and materials and fixed price contracts was and  respectively 
revenue from services provided on a time and materials basis is derived from the number of billable hours in a period multiplied by the contractual rates at which we bill our clients 
revenue from services provided on a fixed price basis is recognized as efforts are expended pursuant to the percentage of completion method 
revenue also includes reimbursements of travel and out of pocket expenses with equivalent amounts of expense recorded in costs of revenue 
most of our client contracts  including those that are on a fixed price basis  can be terminated by our clients with or without cause on to days prior written notice 
all fees for services provided by us through the date of cancellation are generally due and payable under the contract terms 
our unit pricing is driven by business need  delivery timeframes  complexity of the engagement  operating differences such as onsite offshore ratio  competitive environment and engagement size or volume 
as a pricing strategy to encourage clients to increase the volume of services that we provide to them  we may  on occasion  offer volume discounts or longer payment terms 
we manage our business carefully to protect our account margins and our overall profit margins 
we find that our clients generally purchase on the basis of total value  rather than on minimum cost  considering all of the factors listed above 
while we are subject to the effects of overall market pricing pressure  we believe that there is a fairly broad range of pricing offered by different competitors for each service we provide 
we believe that no one competitor  or set of competitors  sets pricing in our industry 
we find that our unit pricing  as a result of our global delivery model  is generally competitive with other firms who operate with a predominately offshore operating model 
the proportion of work performed at our offshore facilities and at onsite client locations varies from period to period 
effort  in terms of the percentage of hours billed to clients by onsite resources  was and of total hours billed in each of the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  while the revenue from resources located onsite and offshore accounted for and respectively in the fiscal year ended march   and and respectively during the fiscal year ended march  we charge higher rates and incur higher compensation costs and other expenses for work performed at client locations in the united states and the united kingdom as compared to work performed at our global delivery centers in india  sri lanka and hungary 
services performed at client locations or at our offices in the united states or the united kingdom generate higher revenue per capita at lower gross margins than similar services performed at our global delivery centers in india and sri lanka 
we manage to a targeted to onsite to offshore service delivery mix  although such delivery mix may be impacted by several factors including our new and existing client delivery requirements as well as the impact of any acquisitions 
costs of revenue and gross profit costs of revenue consist principally of payroll and related fringe benefits  reimbursable and non reimbursable costs  immigration related expenses  fees for subcontractors working on client engagements and share based compensation expense for it professionals including account management personnel 

table of contents wage costs in india and sri lanka have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the united states and europe for comparably skilled it professionals 
however  wages in india and sri lanka are increasing in local currency  which will result in increased costs for it professionals  particularly project managers and other mid level professionals 
we may need to increase the levels of our team member compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive without the ability to make corresponding increases to our billing rates 
compensation increases may reduce our profit margins  make us less competitive in pricing potential projects against those companies with lower cost resources and otherwise harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we deploy a campus hiring philosophy and encourage internal promotions to minimize the effects of wage inflation pressure and recruiting costs 
additionally  any material appreciation in the indian rupee or sri lankan rupee against the us dollar or uk pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our cost of services 
our revenue and gross profit are also affected by our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our it professionals and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we define utilization rate as the total number of days billed in a given period divided by the total available days of our it professionals during that same period  excluding trainees 
we manage employee utilization by continually monitoring project requirements and timetables to efficiently staff our projects and meet our clients needs 
the number of it professionals assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
an unanticipated termination or reduction of a significant project could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned it professionals  thereby lowering our utilization rate 
although  we have adopted a twelve quarter cash flow hedging program to minimize the effect of the indian rupee movement on our financial condition  particularly our costs of revenue  these hedges may not be effective or may cause us to forego benefits  especially given the volatility of these currencies 
in addition  to the extent that these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting  we may have to recognize gains or losses on the aggregate amount of hedges remaining outstanding as of the balance sheet date 
operating expenses operating expenses consist primarily of payroll and related fringe benefits  commissions  selling  share based compensation and non reimbursable costs  as well as promotion  communications  management  finance  administrative  occupancy  marketing and depreciation and amortization expenses 
in the fiscal years ended march    and  we invested in all aspects of our business  including sales  marketing  it infrastructure  facilities  human resources programs and financial operations 
additionally  any material appreciation in the indian rupee or sri lankan rupee against the us dollar or us pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our cost of operating expenses 
other income expense other income expense includes interest income  interest expense  investment gains and losses  foreign currency transaction gains and losses and disposal of fixed assets 
we generate interest income by investing in time deposits  money market instruments  short term investments and long term investments 
the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their local currencies  except for hungary which operates in the euro zone 
foreign currency gains and losses are generated primarily by fluctuations of the indian rupee  sri lankan rupee and uk pound sterling against the uk dollar on intercompany transactions 
we place our cash in liquid investments at highly rated financial institutions based on our investment policy approved by our audit committee and board of directors 
we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
income tax expense our net income is subject to income tax in those countries in which we perform services and have operations  including the united states  the united kingdom  india  sri lanka  the netherlands  germany  
table of contents singapore and hungary 
in the fiscal year ended march   our effective tax rate was impacted by the mix of income by jurisdiction  availability and term of certain tax holidays and settlement of uncertain tax positions identified during the fiscal year ended march  historically  we have benefited from long term income tax holiday arrangements in both india and sri lanka that are offered to certain export oriented it services firms 
as a result of these tax holiday arrangements  our worldwide profit has been subject to a relatively low effective tax rate as compared to the statutory rates in the countries in which we operate 
the effect of the income tax holidays in india and sri lanka decreased our income tax expense in the fiscal years ended march  and by million and million  respectively 
however  our tax expense increased by million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to our tax expense for our fiscal year ended march  due to the increase in income from operations offset by the election of sez co developer holiday benefits and settlement of uncertain tax positions during the period 
increases in our effective tax rate  or a high effective tax rate  has a negative effect on our earnings in future periods 
our effective tax rate was and for each of the fiscal years ended march  and respectively 
our effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the geographic distribution of our earnings  as well as the availability of tax holidays in india and sri lanka 
we expect our effective tax rate to increase as a result of a higher tax rate in india and geographical mix of our profits 
application of critical accounting estimates and risks our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue and expenses  assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements when both of the following are present the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment  and the use of different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
those estimates critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are listed below 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from a variety of it consulting  technology implementation and application outsourcing services 
our services are performed under both time and material and fixed price arrangements 
all revenue is recognized pursuant to us gaap 
revenue is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees billed on a time and materials basis  we generally recognize revenue as the service is performed 
fixed price engagements are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we estimate the percentage of completion by comparing the actual number of work days performed to date to the estimated total number of days required to complete each engagement 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs to completion  including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in other engagement related costs 
our analysis of these contracts also contemplates whether contracts should be combined or segmented 
we combine closely related contracts when all the 
table of contents applicable criteria under gaap are met 
similarly  we may segment a project  which may consist of a single contract or a group of contracts  with varying rates of profitability  only if all the applicable criteria under gaap are met 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs to completion are continually monitored during the term of the contract and are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
unforeseen circumstances may arise during an engagement requiring us to revise our original estimates and may cause the estimated profitability to decrease 
when revisions in estimated contract revenue and efforts are determined  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are first identified 
valuation and impairment of investments and or marketable securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale or trading securities  and carry them at fair market value 
changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date are recorded in the period in which they occur 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax effect  for available for sale securities is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value for trading securities is reflected in other income  net on our consolidated statements of income 
investments and or marketable securities classified as available for sale are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of our investment securities to determine if the decline in fair value of any security is deemed to be other than temporary 
other than temporary impairment losses are recognized on securities when i the holder has an intention to sell the security  ii it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold prior to recovery  or iii the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
other than temporary losses are reflected in earnings as a charge against gain on sale of investments to the extent the impairment is related to credit losses 
the amount of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
we have no intention to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position at march  nor is it more likely than not that we would be required to sell such securities prior to the recovery of the unrealized losses and we expect to recover the entire amortization cost basis of the security 
at march   we believe that all impairments of investment securities are temporary in nature 
our investments in auction rate securities are valued primarily based on an income approach using an estimate of future cash flows because there are currently no active markets or observable market prices 
we have estimated the fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis which considered the following key inputs i the underlying structure and maturity of each security  ii the timing of expected future principal and interest payments  and iii discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on intercompany transactions and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
certain of these transactions meet the criteria for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges under accounting standards codification 
changes in the fair values of these hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the same line item as the item being hedged 
the company measures the effectiveness of these hedges at the time of inception  as well as on an ongoing basis 
if any portion of the hedges is deemed ineffective  the respective portion is recorded in the consolidated statement of income in other income expense 
at maturity changes in the fair value for other derivative contracts  if any  are recognized in the same line item as the underlying exposure being hedged in the statements of income 
we value our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies 
any significant change in the forward or spot prices for currencies would have a significant impact on the value of our derivatives 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price for acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including other intangible assets  is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  defined at the company level  at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently when events or circumstances occur that indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred 
in assessing goodwill for impairment  an entity has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carry amount 
if this is the case  then performing the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary 
an entity can choose not to perform a qualitative assessment for any or all of its reporting units  and proceed directly to the use of the two step impairment test 
the two step process begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
for the company goodwill impairment analysis  the company operates under one reporting unit 
any impairment would be measured based upon the fair value of the related assets 
in performing the first step of the goodwill impairment testing and measurement process  the company compares its entity wide estimated fair value to net book value to identify potential impairment 
management estimates the entity wide fair value utilizing the company market capitalization  plus an appropriate control premium 
market capitalization is determined by multiplying the shares outstanding on the assessment date by the market price of the company common stock 
if the market capitalization is not sufficiently in excess of the company book value  the company will calculate the control premium which considers appropriate industry  market and other pertinent factors 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired 
if the company determines through the impairment evaluation process that goodwill has been impaired  an impairment charge would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company completed the annual impairment test required during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  and determined that there was no impairment 
the company continues to closely monitor its market capitalization 
if the company market capitalization  plus an estimated control premium  is below its carrying value for a period considered to be other than temporary  it is possible that the company may be required to record an impairment of goodwill either as a result of the annual assessment that the company conducts in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or in a future quarter if an indication of potential impairment is evident 
the estimated fair value of goodwill on the assessment date exceeded the carrying book value by 
other intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment when events or circumstances occur that indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred 
we test other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its net undiscounted cash flows  then an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
we use a discounted cash flow approach or other methods  if appropriate  to assess fair value 
the intangible impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level  and the company is considered a single reporting unit for goodwill and intangible impairment testing purposes 
income taxes the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions where the company has operations 
we record liabilities for estimated tax obligations in the united states and other tax jurisdictions 
determining the consolidated 
table of contents provision for income tax expense  tax reserves  deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance  if any  involves judgment 
we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including the united states  the united kingdom  india  sri lanka  the netherlands  germany  singapore and hungary  and these calculations and determinations can involve complex issues which require an extended period of time to resolve 
in the fiscal year of any such resolution  additional adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income 
our overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a variety of factors  including arm length prices for our intercompany transactions  changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income  as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
applicable transfer pricing regulations require that transactions between and among our subsidiaries be conducted at an arm length price 
on an ongoing basis  we estimate appropriate arm length prices and use such estimates for our intercompany transactions 
at each financial statement date  we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
this evaluation considers the weight of all available evidence  including both future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize a recognized deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made  resulting in a decrease in income or equity in the case of excess stock option tax benefits in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we will be able to realize all or part of an unrecognized deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made  resulting in an increase to income or equity in the case of excess stock option tax benefits 
we have benefited from long term income tax holiday arrangements in both india and sri lanka 
one of our indian subsidiaries is an export oriented company that is entitled to claim a tax exemption for a period of ten years for each stp it operates 
our stp holiday for hyderabad and chennai  india was completely phased out by march  and march  respectively 
subsequent to that date  any profits generated in expired stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate  which is currently 
although we believe we have complied with and are eligible for the stp holiday  it is possible that upon examination the government of india may deem us ineligible for the stp holidays or make adjustments to the profit level in previous tax years 
we have located new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones sez to secure additional tax exemptions for these operations for a period of ten years  which could extend to years if we meet certain reinvestment requirements 
during the fiscal year ending march   we elected the tax holiday for our sez co developer located in hyderabad  india for a period of years 
our sri lanka subsidiary has been granted an income tax holiday by the sri lanka board of investment boi which expires on march  the tax holiday is contingent upon a certain level of job creation by us during a given timetable 
although we believe we have met the job creation requirements  if the boi concludes otherwise  this would jeopardize the maximum benefits from this holiday arrangement 
primarily as a result of these tax holiday arrangements  our worldwide profit has been subject to a relatively low effective tax rate  and the loss of any of these arrangements would increase our overall effective tax rate and reduce our net income 
it is our intent to reinvest all accumulated earnings from foreign operations back into their respective businesses to fund growth 
as a component of this strategy  we do not accrue incremental us taxes on foreign earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
if such earnings were to be repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested  we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings  which would increase our overall effective tax rate 
share based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of accounting standards  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period 

table of contents determining the fair value of the share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term over which stock options will be outstanding before they are exercised  the expected volatility of our stock and the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
the risk free interest rate assumptions are based on the interpolation of various us treasury bill rates in effect during the month in which stock option awards are granted 
our volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility rates of the common stock of our publicly held peers over periods commensurate with the expected term of each grant 
the expected term of employee share based awards represents the weighted average period of time that awards are expected to remain outstanding 
the determination of the expected term of share based awards assumes that employees behavior is a function of the awards vested  contractual lives  and the extent to which the award is in the money 
accordingly  we have elected to use the simplified method of determining the expected term or life of its share based awards due to our limited trading history 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and fiscal year ended march  change change dollars in thousands revenue costs of revenue gross profit operating expenses income from operations other income income before income tax expense income tax expense net income revenue revenue increased by  or million  from million during the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to broad based growth in all geographies  led by north america and europe 
revenue from clients existing as of march  increased by million and revenue from new clients increased by million during the fiscal year ended march   as compared to the fiscal year ended march  revenue from north american clients increased by million  or  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  revenue from european clients in the fiscal year ended march  increased by million  or  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  revenue growth was broad based across all of our industry groups  led by bfsi and m i industries which increased by and respectively  in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  we had active clients at march  as compared to active clients at march  
table of contents costs of revenue costs of revenue increased from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march   an increase of million  or 
a significant portion of the increase was attributable to an increase in compensation and benefit costs of million due to an increase in headcount and percentage of onsite work and associated increases in compensation 
the increased costs of revenue are also attributable to increased use of subcontractors of million to support increases in onsite work and an increase of million in travel expenses  as well as an increase in hedging losses of million recorded as a result of our cash flow hedging program in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  gross profit our gross profit increased by million or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to our growth in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  our gross margin was and in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the principal reason for the decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march   was higher cost of revenue during the fiscal year ended march  due in part to a higher percentage of onsite effort  increased cost of subcontractors and compensation increases of our it professionals 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march   an increase of million 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase of million in compensation related expense  million increase in foreign currency forward contract losses as part of our hedging program  million in facilities expenses  million increase in travel expenses and a million increase in professional services 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in bad debt expense during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  as a percentage of revenue  our operating expenses decreased from in the fiscal year ended march  to in the fiscal year ended march  due in part to an increase in operating efficiencies and a larger revenue base

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily from sales of shares of common stock and from cash from operations 
we have not borrowed against our existing or preceding credit facilities 
in may  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our common stock over a month period from the approval date  subject to certain price and other trading restrictions 
during the year ended march   we purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million excluding commissions 
see part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of october   our board of directors suspended the share repurchase program and the program has now expired 
on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets of alas for the purchase price of approximately million in cash  of which was held back by us for a period of months as security for the indemnification obligations of alas and its members 
in july  we released million to alas and its members with respect to the holdback plus interest and retained  to satisfy certain indemnification obligations 
this resulted in a decrease to short term restricted cash of million 
on july   we entered into a million credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank  jp jpmc which expires on july  the primary purpose of this credit agreement is to support our foreign currency hedging programs 
the credit agreement is secured by a grant of a security interest in our us assets in favor of jpmc as well as other collateral 
the agreement contains financial and reporting covenants and limitations 
at march   there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility and we are in compliance with all covenants 
at march   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  of which we hold approximately million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in non us locations  particularly in india  sri lanka and the united kingdom 
cash in these non us locations may not otherwise be available for potential investments or operations in the united states or certain other geographies where needed  as we have stated that this cash is indefinitely reinvested in these non us locations 
we do not currently plan to repatriate this cash to the united states 
however  if our intent were to change and we elected to repatriate this cash back to the united states  or this cash was deemed no longer permanently invested  this cash would be subject to substantial taxes and the change in such intent could have a material adverse effect on our cash balances as well as our overall statement of operations 
due to various methods by which cash could be repatriated to the united states in the future  the amount of taxes attributable to the cash is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs 
we estimate that it could cost us as much as million to repatriate cash back to the united states 
in addition  some countries could have tight restrictions on the movement and exchange of foreign currencies which could further limit our ability to use such funds for global operations or capital or other strategic investments 
beginning in fiscal  our uk subsidiary entered into an agreement with an unrelated financial institution to sell  without recourse  certain of its european based accounts receivable balances from one client to such financial institution 
during the fiscal year ended march   we sold million of receivables under the terms of the financing agreement 
fees paid pursuant to this agreement were immaterial during the fiscal year ended march  we may elect to use this program again in future periods 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that this or any other financing facilities will be available or utilized in the future 
we expect capital expenditures in the normal course of business during the year ended march  to be consistent with our historical capital expenditures

net cash used for investing activities net cash used for investing activities was million during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the change was primarily due to the net decreases in the proceeds of investments of million 
these decreases were partially offset by a reduction in cash used for the business acquisition of alas of million  a decrease in the change in restricted cash of million  which includes the million holdback related to the alas acquisition and a decrease in purchase of property and equipment of million

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million during the fiscal year ended march   as compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in cash provided is primarily due to repurchase of shares of our common stock of million under our stock repurchase program  a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of million  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of million and a reduction in the payment of contingent consideration of million in connection with the convista acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the fiscal year ended march   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during the fiscal year ended march  the primary change in net cash provided was due to a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises of million and payment of convista contingent consideration of million  partially offset by a decrease in capital lease obligations of million and a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock options of million 
contractual obligations we have no long term debt and have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments at march  payments due by period total less than year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease obligation defined benefit plans capital and other purchase commitments total our obligations under our operating leases consist of future payments related to our real estate leases 
capital lease relates to purchase of vehicles 
we accrue and contribute to benefit funds covering our employees in india and sri lanka 
the amounts in the table represent the expected benefits to be paid out over the next ten years 
we are not able to quantify expected benefit payments beyond ten years with any certainty 
we make periodic contributions to the plans such that the unfunded amounts are immaterial 
relates to build out of various facilities in india  and other purchase commitments  net of advances 
as of march   we had  of unrecognized tax benefits 
this represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
resolution of the related tax positions with the relevant tax authorities may take years to complete  since such timing is not entirely within our control 
it is reasonably possible that within the next months certain positions will be resolved  which could result in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits 
these decreases may be offset by increases to unrecognized tax benefits if new positions are identified 
the resolution or settlement of positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore it is not practical to estimate the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
we have entered into foreign currency derivative contracts with the objective of limiting our exposure to changes in the indian rupee as described below and in qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
we maintain a foreign currency cash flow hedging program designed to further mitigate the risks of volatility in the indian rupee against the us dollar and us pound sterling as described below in qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
from time to time  we may also purchase multiple foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge fluctuation in foreign currencies  such as the uk pound sterling  against the uk dollar  or the uk pound sterling against the sri lankan rupee  and multiple foreign currency hedges designed to hedge foreign currency transaction gains and losses on our intercompany balances 
other than these foreign currency derivative contracts  we have not entered into off balance sheet transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the provisions of this new guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this new disclosure requirement did not have a material impact on the company disclosure or consolidated financial position  financial results or cash flows 
in september  fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
the updated guidance gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
the updated accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company consolidated financial position or financial results 
in july  the fasb issued guidance on the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in order to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets by simplifying how an entity tests those assets for impairment and to improve consistency in impairment testing guidance 
the new guidance allows an entity the option to make a qualitative assessment about the likelihood that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should then perform a quantitative impairment test 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  and earlier adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in february  fasb issued guidance related to accumulated other comprehensive income  requiring the presentation of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to the respective line items in the statement of operations 
for those amounts required by us gaap to be reclassified to earnings in their entirety in the same reporting period  this presentation is required either on the statement of operations or in a single footnote 
for items that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to earnings  the presentation requirement can be met by cross referencing 
table of contents disclosures elsewhere in the footnotes 
the pronouncement is effective on a prospective basis effective for interim and annual reporting periods that start after december  the adoption of this standard affects financial statement presentation only and will have no effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
we have historically entered into  and in the future we may enter into  foreign currency derivative contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on both foreign currency denominated assets and forecasted expenses 
certain of these contracts meet the criteria for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges 
we evaluate our foreign exchange policy on an ongoing basis to assess our ability to address foreign exchange exposures on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income and operating cash flows from all foreign currencies  including most significantly the indian rupee  uk pound sterling  and the sri lankan rupee 
we have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges  designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in the us dollar equivalent of our indian rupee denominated expenses over a rolling month period 
as of march   the notional value of these contracts was million 
the outstanding contracts as of march  are scheduled to mature each month through fiscal years ending march  and december  at march   the net unrealized loss on our outstanding cash flow hedge contracts was million 
based upon a sensitivity analysis of our cash flow hedge contracts at march   which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations  a change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase or decrease in fair value of approximately million 
interest rate risk we had no debt outstanding at march  we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  the interest income from which is affected by changes in interest rates 
our invested securities primarily consist of government sponsored entity bonds  money market mutual funds  commercial paper  corporate debts and auction rate securities 
our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
our available for sale investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates at march  would impact the net fair value of such interest sensitive financial instruments by million 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  accounts receivable  derivative contracts  other financial assets and unbilled accounts receivable 
we place our operating cash  investments and derivatives in highly rated financial institutions 
we adhere to a formal investment policy with the primary objective of preservation of principal  which contains credit rating minimums and diversification requirements 
we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties and  accordingly  do not require collateral 
credit losses and write offs of accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our consolidated financial statements and have not exceeded our expectations
