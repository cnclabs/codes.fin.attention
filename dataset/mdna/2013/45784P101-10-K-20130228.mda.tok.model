the omnipod system is the only commercially available insulin infusion system of its kind 
the omnipod system features a unique disposable tubeless omnipod which is worn on the body for approximately three days at a time and our handheld  wireless personal diabetes manager pdm 
conventional insulin pumps require people with insulin dependent diabetes to learn to use  manage and wear a number of cumbersome components  including up to inches of tubing 
in contrast  the omnipod system features only two discreet  easy to use devices that eliminate the need for a bulky pump  tubing and separate blood glucose meter  provides for virtually pain free automated cannula insertion  communicates wirelessly and integrates a blood glucose meter 
we believe that the omnipod system s unique proprietary design offers significant lifestyle benefits to people with insulin dependent diabetes 
to support our sales of the omnipod system  in june  we acquired neighborhood holdings  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively  neighborhood diabetes in order to expand our full suite diabetes management product offerings and obtain access to a larger number of insulin dependent patients 
through neighborhood diabetes  we are able to provide customers with blood glucose testing supplies  traditional insulin pumps  pump supplies and pharmaceuticals and have the ability to process claims as either durable medical equipment or through pharmacy benefits 
the us food and drug administration fda approved the original omnipod system in january  and we began commercial sale in the united states in october we received ce mark approval for the original omnipod system in april since the commercial launch of the omnipod system  we have progressively expanded our marketing efforts to provide availability of the omnipod system in the entire united states 
we have also expanded the availability of the omnipod system internationally through our partnerships with ypsomed distribution ag ypsomed and glaxosmithkline inc gsk 
in january  we entered into a distribution agreement with ypsomed pursuant to which ypsomed became the exclusive distributor of the omnipod system in multiple countries 
in february  we entered into a distribution agreement with gsk pursuant to which gsk became the exclusive distributor of the omnipod system in canada 
under these distribution agreements  we supply omnipods and pdms to ypsomed and gsk  and they are responsible for the sale to the customer  including distribution  reimbursement and customer support 
in august  we received ce mark approval  and in december  we received k clearance for our next generation omnipod system by the fda 
we sell our proprietary omnipod system as well as blood glucose testing supplies  traditional insulin pumps  pump supplies  pharmaceuticals and other products for the management and treatment of diabetes to 
table of contents people with diabetes 
through our infrastructure in the reimbursement  billing and collection areas  we are able to provide for adjudication of claims as either durable medical equipment or through pharmacy benefits 
claims are adjudicated under private insurers  medicaid or medicare 
we are aligning third party payor contracts to be able to better leverage our cross selling initiatives 
as we expand our sales and marketing focus  increase our manufacturing capacity  expand to additional international markets and broaden our high touch patient model  we will need to maintain and expand available reimbursement for our product offerings 
our sales and marketing effort is focused on generating demand and acceptance of the omnipod system among key diabetes practitioners  academic medical centers  clinics  people with insulin dependent diabetes  third party payors  government agencies  and third party distributors 
our marketing strategy is to build awareness for the benefits of the omnipod system as well as our high touch patient model through a wide range of education programs  social networking  patient demonstration programs  support materials  media advertisements and events at the national  regional and local levels 
we use third party distributors to improve our access to managed care and government reimbursement programs  expand our commercial presence and provide access to additional potential patients 
our total revenue was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a medical device manufacturer and distributor  reimbursement from third party payors is an important element of our success 
if patients are not adequately reimbursed for the costs of using the omnipod system or our other diabetes supplies  it will be much more difficult for us to penetrate the market 
we continue to negotiate contracts establishing reimbursement for the omnipod system with national and regional third party payors 
as part of the integration of neighborhood diabetes  we are aligning third party payor contracts  both ours and those of neighborhood diabetes  to be able to better leverage our cross selling initiatives 
as we expand our sales and marketing focus  increase our manufacturing capacity  expand to international markets and leverage the neighborhood diabetes model  we will need to maintain and expand available reimbursement for our product offerings 
we currently produce the omnipod system on partially automated manufacturing lines at a facility in china operated by a subsidiary of flextronics international ltd 
flextronics 
we purchase complete omnipods pursuant to our agreement with flextronics 
under the agreement  flextronics has agreed to supply us with omnipods at agreed upon prices per unit pursuant to a rolling forecast that we provide 
the current term of the agreement expires in december and is automatically renewed for one year terms subsequently 
it may be terminated upon prior written notice given no less than a specified number of days prior to the date of termination 
the specified number of days is intended to provide the parties with sufficient time to make alternative arrangements in the event of termination 
to achieve profitability  we continue to seek to increase manufacturing volume and reduce the per unit production cost for the omnipod 
by increasing production volumes of the omnipod  we have been able to reduce our per unit raw material costs and improve absorption of manufacturing overhead costs 
our next generation omnipod was designed to lower the cost of the product further through component sourcing  volume discounts and efficient manufacturing 
the cost reductions are important as we strive to achieve profitability 
we believe our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our expected demand for omnipods 
we purchase certain other diabetes management supplies from manufacturers at contracted rates and supply these products to our customers 
based on market penetration  payor plans and other factors  certain manufacturers provide rebates based on product sold 
we record these rebates as a reduction to cost of goods sold as they are earned 
since our inception in  we have incurred losses every quarter 
in the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations through private placements of debt and equity securities  public offerings of our common stock  issuances of convertible 
table of contents debt and borrowings under certain other debt agreements 
as of december   we had million of convertible debt outstanding 
of the million of convertible debt outstanding  million matures in june and approximately million matures in june since our inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock  common stock and debt 
our long term financial objective is to achieve and sustain profitable growth 
our efforts in the beginning of will be focused primarily on the production and commercial launch of our next generation omnipod system as well as the expansion of our customer base in the united states and internationally 
we also plan to focus on development projects such as the integration of our omnipod system with the lifescan  inc lifescan onetouch blood glucose monitoring technology  the feasibility of enhancing our omnipod system to incorporate continuous sensing technology into the omnipod system  and the ability to use our omnipod system as a delivery platform for other pharmaceuticals 
achieving these objectives and increasing our penetration in the united states and international markets is expected to require additional investments in certain personnel and initiatives 
we believe that we will continue to incur net losses in the near term in order to achieve these objectives 
however  we believe that the accomplishment of our near term objectives will have a positive impact on our financial condition in the future 
in january  we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with the cash to be generated from expected product sales  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements for the next twelve months 
acquisition of neighborhood diabetes on june   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of neighborhood diabetes  a durable medical equipment distributor specializing in direct to consumer sales of diabetes supplies  including pharmaceuticals  and support services 
neighborhood diabetes serves more than  customers with type and type diabetes primarily in the northeast and southeast regions of the united states with blood glucose testing supplies  traditional insulin pumps  pump supplies  pharmaceuticals  as well as other products for the management and treatment of diabetes 
neighborhood diabetes is based in massachusetts  with additional offices in new york and florida 
at the time of the acquisition  neighborhood diabetes employed approximately people across its three locations 
the acquisition of neighborhood diabetes provides us with full suite diabetes management product offerings  accelerates our sales force expansion  strengthens our back office support capabilities  expands our access to insulin dependent patients  and provides pharmacy adjudication capabilities to drive incremental sales higher 
the aggregate purchase price of approximately million consisted of approximately million in cash paid at closing   shares of our common stock valued at approximately million  or per share based on the closing price of our common stock on the acquisition date  and contingent consideration with a fair value of approximately million 
of the million of cash  million is being held in an escrow account to reimburse us and our affiliates for certain claims for which we are entitled to be indemnified pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger with neighborhood diabetes 
we have accounted for the acquisition of neighborhood diabetes as a business combination 
under business combination accounting  the assets and liabilities of neighborhood diabetes were recorded as of the acquisition date  at their respective fair values  and consolidated with our results 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
the operating results of neighborhood diabetes have been included in the consolidated financial statements since june  the period in which the acquisition was completed 
the purchase price allocation  including an independent appraisal for intangible assets  has been prepared based on the information that was available to management at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared 
the allocation of the purchase price was finalized during the year ended december

these costs have been recorded as general and administrative expense in the year ended december  financial operations overview revenue 
we derive most of our revenue from the sale of the omnipod system and other diabetes related products including blood glucose testing supplies  traditional insulin pumps  pump supplies and other pharmaceuticals to customers and third party distributors who resell the product to customers 
the omnipod system is comprised of two devices the omnipod  a disposable insulin infusion device that the patient wears for up to three days and then replaces  and the pdm  a handheld device much like a personal digital assistant that wirelessly programs the omnipod with insulin delivery instructions  assists the patient with diabetes management and incorporates a blood glucose meter 
we received fda approval for the original omnipod system in january and began commercial sale in the us in october we received ce mark approval for the original omnipod system in april we are currently selling our omnipod system through our partnership with ypsomed in multiple countries in europe and through our partnership with gsk in canada 
in august we received ce mark approval and in december we received k clearance for the next generation omnipod system by the fda 
in june  we entered into a development agreement with a us based pharmaceutical company the development agreement 
under the development agreement  we are required to perform design  development  regulatory  and other services to support the pharmaceutical company as it works to obtain regulatory approval to use our drug delivery technology as a delivery method for its pharmaceutical 
over the term of the development agreement  we have and expect to continue to invoice amounts as we meet certain defined deliverable milestones 
revenue on the development agreement is recognized using a proportional performance methodology based on efforts incurred and total payments under the agreement 
as of december  and  we had deferred revenue of million and million  respectively 
these amounts primarily include product related revenue and unrecognized amounts related to the development agreement 
for the year ending december   we expect our revenue to continue to increase as we introduce our next generation omnipod system  leverage our high touch patient model to gain new customers in 
table of contents the united states and continue expansion in europe  canada  and certain other international markets 
increased revenue will be dependent upon the success of our sales efforts  our ability to produce our next generation omnipods in sufficient volumes as our patient base grows  the successful launch and transition to our next generation omnipod system  the impact of competitive bidding on certain durable medical equipment items including mail order diabetes testing supplies  and other risks and uncertainties 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of raw material  labor  warranty and overhead costs such as freight  depreciation  and packaging costs  related to the omnipod system  the cost of products we acquire from third party suppliers  and costs incurred related to the development agreement 
cost of revenue will continue to increase in line with an increase in revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our product development  regulatory and clinical functions  and the costs of market studies and product development projects 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
for the year ending december   we expect overall research and development spending to remain consistent with our spend as we drive cost efficiencies in our next generation omnipod  work with lifescan to develop and gain regulatory approval on our pdm integrating lifescan s onetouch blood glucose monitoring technology  determine the feasibility of incorporating continuous sensing technology into the pod  and identify uses of our omnipod system as a delivery platform for other pharmaceuticals 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  finance  information technology and human resource functions  as well as legal fees  accounting fees  insurance costs  bad debt expenses  shipping  handling and facilities related costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in the year ending december  as compared to to support our overall growth 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our sales  marketing  reimbursement support  customer support and training functions  sales commissions paid to our sales representatives and costs associated with participation in medical conferences  physician symposia and promotional activities  including distribution of units used in our demonstration kit programs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the year ending december  as compared to as we continue expansion of our sales force to enhance the growth of our existing business as we introduce our next generation product to new and existing customers 
restructuring and impairments of assets 
in connection with our efforts to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing of asset costs  we periodically perform an evaluation of our manufacturing processes and review the carrying value of our property and equipment to assess the recoverability of these assets and determine whether impairment may have occurred 
as part of this assessment  we review the planned use of the assets as well as the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if impairment is indicated through this review  the carrying amount of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value 
this review of manufacturing processes and equipment can result in an impairment of assets based on current net book value and potential future use of the assets 
restructuring and impairment of assets is typically based on a review of our manufacturing processes and equipment and may include the difference between the net book value of an asset and the asset s fair value based on our expectation of its potential future use 
in addition  restructuring expense may also include workforce reduction and related costs for one time termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement 
estimates of related costs such as taxes and outplacement services may be provided under the plan 
if changes in these estimated services occur  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with these workforce reduction and related costs

shareholder rights plan in november  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan the shareholder s rights plan  as set forth in the shareholder rights agreement between us and the rights agent  the purpose of which is  among other things  to enhance the ability of the board of directors to protect shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of us is made in the future 
the shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  us or a large block of our common stock 
in connection with the adoption of the shareholder rights plan  our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on november  in addition  one right will automatically attach to each share of common stock issued between november  and the distribution date 
the rights currently are not exercisable and are attached to and trade with the outstanding shares of common stock 
under the shareholder rights plan  the rights become exercisable if a person or group becomes an acquiring person by acquiring or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or if a person or group commences a tender offer that would result in that person or group owning or more of the common stock 
if a person or group becomes an acquiring person  each holder of a right other than the acquiring person would 
table of contents be entitled to purchase  at the then current exercise price  such number of shares of our preferred stock which are equivalent to shares of common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after any such event  each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase  at the then current exercise price  shares of the acquiring company s common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
revenue recognition we generate nearly all of our revenue from sales of our omnipod insulin management system and other diabetes related products including blood glucose testing supplies  insulin pumps  pump supplies and pharmaceuticals to customers and third party distributors who resell the products to patients with diabetes 
revenue recognition requires that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery of goods occurs through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with respect to these criteria the evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a physician order form  a patient information form and  if applicable  third party insurance approval for sales directly to patients or a purchase order for sales to a third party distributor 

table of contents transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership are typically passed to the patient or third party distributor upon shipment of the products 
the selling prices for all sales are fixed and agreed with the patient or third party distributor  and if applicable  the patient s third party insurance provider s prior to shipment and are based on established list prices or  in the case of certain third party insurers  contractually agreed upon prices 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are established as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we offer a day right of return for our omnipod insulin system sales to new patients  and we defer revenue to reflect estimated sales returns in the same period that the related product sales are recorded 
returns are estimated through a comparison of our historical return data to our related sales 
historical rates of return are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace when appropriate 
historically  sales returns have amounted to approximately of gross product sales 
when doubt exists about reasonable assuredness of collectibility from specific customers  we defer revenue from sales of products to those customers until payment is received 
in june  we entered into a development agreement with a us based pharmaceutical company the development agreement 
under the development agreement  we are required to perform design  development  regulatory  and other services to support the pharmaceutical company as it works to obtain regulatory approval to use our drug delivery technology as a delivery method for its pharmaceutical 
over the term of the development agreement  we have invoiced and expect to continue to invoice amounts based upon meeting certain defined deliverable milestones 
revenue on the development agreement is recognized using a proportional performance methodology based on efforts incurred and total payments under the agreement 
we had deferred revenue of million as of december  the deferred revenue recorded as of december  was primarily comprised of product related revenue and unrecognized amounts related to the development agreement 
restructuring expense and impairment of assets in connection with our efforts to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing  we periodically perform an evaluation of our manufacturing processes and review the carrying value of our property and equipment to assess the recoverability of these assets whenever events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
as part of this assessment  we review the planned use of the assets as well as the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if impairment is indicated through this review  the carrying amount of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value 
this review of manufacturing processes and equipment can result in restructuring activity or an impairment of assets based on current net book value and potential future use of the assets 
our restructuring expenses may also include workforce reduction and related costs for one time termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement 
we record these one time termination benefits upon incurring the liability  provided that the employees are notified  the plan is approved by the appropriate level of management  the employees to be terminated and the expected completion date are identified and the benefits the identified employees will be paid are established 
significant changes to the plan are not expected when we record the costs 
in recording the workforce reduction and related costs  we estimate related costs such as taxes and outplacement services which may be provided under the plan 
if changes in these estimated services occur  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with these workforce reduction and related costs 

table of contents asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
inventories are held at the lower of their cost or market value 
we periodically review inventories for potential impairment based on quantities on hand and expectations of future use 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the life of the lease  whichever is shorter 
we review long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we also review assets under construction to ensure certainty of their future installation and integration into the manufacturing process 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we consider various valuation factors  principally planned use of the assets and discounted cash flows  to assess the fair values of long lived assets 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we follow the provisions of fasb asc  income taxes asc on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  asc provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as of december  we had million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded 
we file federal  state and foreign tax returns 
these returns are generally open to examination by the relevant tax authorities from three to four years from the date they are filed 
the tax filings relating to our federal and state tax returns are currently open to examination for tax years through and through  respectively 
in addition  we have generated tax losses since our inception in these years may be subject to examination if the losses are carried forward and utilized in future years 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was  and was comprised of  for the current portion and  for the deferred portion 
the current portion primarily relates to state  local  and foreign taxes as well as benefit realized for the release of certain reserves 
the deferred portion primarily relates to us federal and state tax amounts 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted 
we determine the intrinsic value of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize the compensation expense of share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 

table of contents the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected life of the awards is estimated based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on company history and the expectation that we will not pay dividends 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value the awards on a quarterly basis and if factors change and different assumptions are utilized  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what has been recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
in the year ended december  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due from third party payors  patients  third party distributors  and government agencies 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded at the time the potential collection risk is identified 
we estimate our allowance based on historical experience  assessment of specific risk  discussions with individual customers or various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we believe the reserve is adequate to mitigate current collection risk 
intangibles and other long lived assets our finite lived intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
we assess our intangible and other long lived assets for impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the need for an impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows 
any such impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows requires us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
the estimated life of the acquired tradename is years 
the estimated life of the acquired customer relationships asset is ten years 
intangible assets with determinable estimated lives are amortized over these lives 
at december  intangible assets related to the acquisition of neighborhood diabetes consisted of million of customer relationships and million of tradenames 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquired neighborhood diabetes business over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
we perform an assessment of our goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there might be impairment 
goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level 
to test for impairment  we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we completed our goodwill analysis as of october  and noted no impairment 
warranty we provide a four year warranty on our pdms and may replace any omnipods that do not function in accordance with product specifications 
we estimate our warranty at the time the product is shipped based on 
table of contents historical experience and the estimated cost to service the claims 
cost to service the claims reflects the current product cost which has been decreasing over time 
as these estimates are based on historical experience  and we continue to introduce new versions of existing products  we also consider the anticipated performance of the product over its warranty period in estimating warranty reserves 
at december  the warranty reserve was million

asu no 
gives a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitely lived intangible is impaired 
qualitative factors include related events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset 
the guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after september  we believe the adoption of asu no 
will have no material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses and long term obligations 
we consider investments that  when purchased  have a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
the primary objectives of our investment strategy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
to minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest mainly in cash equivalents and maintain an average maturity of six months or less 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income 
on december   we had outstanding debt recorded at million related to our notes and outstanding debt recorded at million related to our notes
