overview asta funding  inc  together with its wholly owned significant operating subsidiaries palisades collection llc  palisades acquisition xvi  llc palisades xvi  vativ recovery solutions llc vativ  asfi pegasus holdings  llc aph  fund pegasus  llc fund pegasus  and other subsidiaries  not all wholly owned  and not considered material the company  we or us  is primarily engaged in the business of acquiring  managing  servicing and recovering on portfolios of consumer receivables 
these portfolios generally consist of one or more of the following types of consumer receivables charged off receivables accounts that have been written off by the originators and may have been previously serviced by collection agencies  semi performing receivables accounts where the debtor is currently making partial or irregular monthly payments  but the accounts may have been written off by the originators  and performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making regular monthly payments that may or may not have been delinquent in the past 
a large portion of our distressed consumer receivables are mastercard  visa and other credit card accounts which were charged off by the issuers or providers for non payment 
we acquire these and other consumer receivable portfolios at substantial discounts to their face values 
the discounts are based on the characteristics issuer  account size  debtor location and age of debt of the underlying accounts of each portfolio 
in addition  the company  owns of pegasus funding  llc pegasus  which invests in funding personal injury claims 
we operate solely in the united states in one reportable business segment 
prior to purchasing a portfolio  we perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying receivables and calculate the purchase price which is intended to offer us an adequate return on our investment after servicing expenses 
after purchasing a portfolio  we actively monitor performance and review and adjust our collection and servicing strategies accordingly 
we purchase receivables from credit grantors and others through privately negotiated direct sales  brokered transactions and auctions in which sellers of receivables seek bids from several pre qualified debt purchasers 
we fund portfolios through a combination of internally generated cash flow and bank debt  if needed 
our objective is to maximize our return on investment in acquired consumer receivable portfolios 
as a result  before acquiring a portfolio  we analyze the portfolio to determine how to best maximize collections in a cost efficient manner and decide whether to use our internal servicing and collection department  third party collection agencies  attorneys  or a combination of all three options 
when we outsource the servicing of receivables  our management typically determines the appropriate third party collection agencies and attorneys based on the type of receivables purchased 
once a group of receivables is sent to third party collection agencies and attorneys  our management actively monitors and reviews the third party collection agencies and attorneys performance on an ongoing basis 
based on portfolio performance considerations  our management will either i move certain receivables from one third party collection agency or attorney to another or to our internal servicing department if it anticipates that this will result in an increase in collections  or ii sell portions of the portfolio accounts 
our internal collection unit  which currently employs approximately collection related staff  including senior management  assists us in benchmarking our third party collection agencies and attorneys  and provides us with greater flexibility for servicing a percentage of our consumer receivable portfolios in house 
we are a delaware corporation whose principal executive offices are located at sylvan avenue  englewood cliffs  new jersey we were incorporated in new jersey on july  and were reincorporated in delaware on october   as the result of a merger with a delaware corporation 
we were formed as an 
table of contents affiliate of asta group  incorporated the family entity  an entity owned by arthur stern  our chairman emeritus  gary stern  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other members of the stern family  to purchase  at a small discount to face value  retail installment sales contracts secured by motor vehicles 
we became a public company in november in  we capitalized on our management s almost years of experience and expertise in acquiring and managing consumer receivable portfolios for the family entity 
as a result  we ceased purchasing automobile contracts and  with the assistance and financial support of the family entity and a partner  purchased our first significant consumer receivable portfolio 
since then  the family entity ceased acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and  accordingly  does not compete with the company 
industry overview the purchasing  servicing and collection of charged off  semi performing and performing consumer receivables is an industry that is driven by increasing levels of consumer debt  increasing defaults of the underlying receivables  and increasing utilization of third party providers to collect such receivables 
strategy although we are in a challenging economic period and an enhanced regulatory environment  our primary objective remains to utilize our management s experience and expertise by identifying  evaluating  pricing and acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and maximizing collections of such receivables in a cost efficient manner 
our strategies include managing the collection and servicing of our consumer receivable portfolios  including outsourcing a majority of those activities to maintain low fixed overhead  selling accounts on an opportunistic basis  generally when our efforts have been exhausted through traditional collecting methods  or when we can capitalize on pricing during times when we feel the pricing environment is high  and capitalizing on our strategic relationships to identify and acquire consumer receivable portfolios as pricing  financing and conditions permit 
because we reduced our purchases of consumer receivables portfolios  there has been a reduction in finance income 
instead  we focused on reducing our debt and being highly disciplined in our portfolio purchases 
we continue to review potential portfolio acquisitions regularly and will buy at a price that we believe will yield our desired rate of return 
we believe that  given our management s experience and expertise  along with the fragmented yet growing market in which we operate  as we implement this short term strategy  we will be in position to again grow our business as economic conditions stabilize 
consumer receivables business receivables purchase program we purchase bulk receivable portfolios that include charged off receivables  semi performing receivables and performing receivables 
these receivables consist primarily of mastercard  visa and private label credit card accounts  among other types of receivables 
in the past we have acquired  directly and indirectly  through the consumer receivable portfolios that we acquire  secured consumer asset portfolios  consisting primarily of receivables secured by automobiles 
we identify potential portfolio acquisitions on an ongoing basis through our relationships with industry participants  financial institutions  collection agencies  investors and our financing sources  
table of contents brokers who specialize in the sale of consumer receivable portfolios  and other sources 
historically  the purchase prices of the consumer receivable portfolios we have acquired have ranged from less than  to approximately  however  we acquired one group of portfolios in march for million the portfolio purchase 
as a part of our strategy to acquire consumer receivable portfolios  we have  from time to time  entered into  and may continue to enter into  participation and profit sharing agreements with our sources of financing and our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
these arrangements may take the form of a joint bid with one of our third party collection agencies  collection attorneys  or financing sources that assist in the acquisition of a portfolio 
this joint bid provides us with more favorable non recourse financing terms or a discounted servicing commission 
current participation agreements include a sharing arrangement after we have recouped of the cost of the portfolio purchase plus the cost of funds 
we utilize our relationships with brokers  third party collection agencies and attorneys  and sellers of portfolios to locate portfolios for purchase 
our senior management is responsible for coordinating due diligence  including  in some cases  on site visits to the seller s office  stratifying and analyzing the portfolio characteristics  valuing the portfolio  preparing bid proposals  negotiating pricing and terms  negotiating and executing a purchase contract  closing the purchase  and coordinating the receipt of account documentation for the acquired portfolios 
the seller or broker typically supplies us with either a sample listing or the actual portfolio being sold  through an electronic form of media 
we analyze each consumer receivable portfolio to determine if it meets our purchasing criteria 
we may then prepare a bid or negotiate a purchase price 
if a purchase is completed  management monitors the portfolio s performance and uses this information in determining future buying criteria including pricing 
an integral part of the acquisition process is the oversight by our investment committee 
this committee  established in january  must review and approve all investments above million in value 
voting criteria are more stringent as the size of the investment increases 
the current members of the committee are the chairman emeritus  the chief executive officer  the chief financial officer  and the senior vice president 
as the chairman emeritus and chief executive officer are related family members  at least one other officer must approve transactions 
after determining that an investment should yield an adequate return on our acquisition cost after servicing fees  including court costs  we use a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors to calculate the estimated cash flows 
the following variables are analyzed and factored into our original estimates the number of collection agencies previously attempting to collect the receivables in the portfolio  the average balance of the receivables  the age of the receivables as older receivables might be more difficult to collect or might be less cost effective  past history of performance of similar assets as we purchase portfolios of similar assets  we believe we have built significant history on how these receivables will liquidate and cash flow  number of months since charge off  payments made since charge off  
table of contents the credit originator and their credit guidelines  the locations of the customers as there are states with better regulatory environments  better collection histories  and that are better suited to attempt to collect in and ultimately we have better predictability of the liquidations and the expected cash flows all of which factor into our cash flow analysis  financial wherewithal of the seller  jobs or property of the customers within portfolios this is of particular importance 
customers with jobs or property are more likely to repay their obligation and  conversely  customers without jobs or property are less likely to repay their obligation  and the ability to obtain customer statements from the original issuer 
we obtain and utilize  as appropriate  input including  but not limited to  monthly collection projections and liquidation rates from our third party collection agencies and attorneys  as further evidentiary matter  to assist us in developing collection strategies and in modeling the expected cash flows for a given portfolio 
once a receivable portfolio has been identified for potential purchase  we prepare various analyses based on extracting customer level data from external sources  other than the issuer  to analyze the potential collectability of the portfolio 
we also analyze the portfolio by comparing it to similar portfolios previously acquired by us 
in addition  we perform qualitative analyses of other matters affecting the value of portfolios  including a review of the delinquency  charge off  placement and recovery policies of the originator as well as the collection authority granted by the originator to any third party collection agencies  and  if possible  by reviewing their recovery efforts on the particular portfolio 
after these evaluations are completed  members of our senior management discuss the findings  decide whether to make the purchase and finalize the price at which we are willing to purchase the portfolio 
we purchase most of our consumer receivable portfolios directly from originators and other sellers including  from time to time  our third party collection agencies and attorneys  through i privately negotiated direct sales  and ii through auction type sales in which sellers of receivables seek bids from several pre qualified debt purchasers 
we also  from time to time  use the services of brokers for sourcing consumer receivable portfolios 
we consider a variety of factors in determining whether potential seller may be a source of receivables  a variety of factors are considered 
sellers must demonstrate that they have adequate internal controls to detect fraud  the ability to provide post sale support  and the capacity to honor put back and return warranty requests 
generally  our portfolio purchase agreements provide that we can return certain accounts to the seller within a specified time period 
however  in some transactions  we may acquire a portfolio with few  if any  rights to return accounts to the seller 
after acquiring a portfolio  we conduct a detailed analysis to determine which accounts in the portfolio should be returned to the seller 
although the terms of each portfolio purchase agreement differ  examples of accounts that may be returned to the seller include debts paid prior to the cutoff date  debts in which the consumer filed bankruptcy prior to the cutoff date  debts in which the consumer was deceased prior to cutoff date  and fraudulent accounts 
we have determined that all accounts returned to sellers for fiscal years  and are immaterial 
our purchase agreements generally do not contain any provision for a limitation on the number of accounts that we may return to the seller 
we generally use third parties to determine bankrupt and deceased accounts  allowing us to focus our resources on portfolio collections 
under a typical portfolio purchase agreement  the seller refunds the portion of the purchase price attributable to the returned accounts or delivers replacement receivables to us 
occasionally  
table of contents we will acquire a well seasoned or older portfolio at a reduced price from a seller that is unable to meet all of our purchasing criteria 
when we acquire such portfolios  the purchase price is further discounted beyond the typical discounts we receive on the portfolios we purchase 
vativ  our wholly owned subsidiary located in houston  texas  provides bankruptcy account servicing 
vativ provides us with internal experience and proprietary systems in support of servicing our own bankruptcy accounts  while also affording us the opportunity to enter new markets for acquisitions in the bankruptcy account field 
receivable servicing our objective is to maximize our return on investment on acquired consumer receivable portfolios 
as a result  before acquiring a portfolio  we analyze the portfolio to determine how to best maximize collections in a cost efficient manner and decide whether to use a third party collection agency or an attorney 
therefore  if we are successful in acquiring the portfolio  we can promptly process the receivables that were purchased and commence the collection process 
unlike collection agencies that typically have only a specified period of time to recover a receivable  as the portfolio owner  we have significantly more flexibility and can establish payment programs 
we presently outsource a significant amount of our receivable servicing to third party collection agencies and attorneys 
our senior management typically determines the appropriate third party collection agency and attorney based on the type of receivables purchased 
once a group of receivables is sent to a third party collection agency or attorney  our management actively monitors and reviews the third party collection agency s and attorney s performance on an ongoing basis 
our management receives detailed analyses  including collection activity and portfolio performance  from our internal servicing departments for the purpose of evaluating the results of the efforts of the third party collection agencies and attorneys 
based on portfolio performance guidelines  our management will reassign certain receivables from one third party collection agency or attorney to another if we believe such change will enhance collections 
at september   approximately of our portfolio face value was serviced by seven collection organizations 
we have servicing agreements in place with these seven collection organizations as well as all other third party collection agencies and attorneys 
these servicing agreements cover standard contingency fees and servicing of the accounts 
litigation funding business on december   the company purchased an interest in pegasus 
pegasus legal funding plf holds the other interest

these loans will provide financing for the personal injury litigation claims and operating expenses of pegasus 
pegasus is actively managed by personal injury litigation funders  max alperovich and alexander khanas  who rely upon strict underwriting criteria to provide legal funding to personal injury plaintiffs prior to the settlement of their claims or their resolution in court

our initial investment in the venture consists of up to million to fund divorce claims to be fulfilled in three tranches of million 
each investment tranche is contingent upon a minimum cash on cash return to us 
at our option  there could be an additional million investment in divorce claims in tranches of million  million  and million  also with a preferred return and such investments may even exceed a total of million  at our sole option 
should the preferred return be less than on any million tranche  the profit and loss split would be adjusted to reflect our priority to a preferred return 
as of september   we have invested million in cases managed by this venture 
we provided a million revolving line of credit to partially fund balance point management s operations with such loan bearing interest at the prevailing prime rate  with an initial term of twenty four months  which may be extended under certain circumstances for an additional month period 
the revolving line of credit is collateralized by balance point management s profits share in the venture and other assets 
at september   the balance on the revolving line of credit was approximately  operations the operations servicing division consists of the collection department  media department  disputes department  correspondence department  and accounting and finance department collection department the collection department is responsible for making and receiving contact with and from consumers for the purpose of collecting upon the accounts contained in our consumer receivables portfolios 
collection efforts are specific to accounts that are not yet being serviced by our network of external agencies and attorneys 
the collection department uses a friendly  customer service approach to collect receivables and utilizes collection software  a dialer and telephone system to accomplish this goal 
each collector is responsible for initiating outbound collection calls and handling incoming calls from the consumer  identifying the debt and iterating the benefits of paying the obligation  working with the customer to develop acceptable means of satisfying the obligation  and offering if necessary  and based upon the individual situation an obligor a discount on the overall obligation 
additionally  the collection department utilizes a series of collection letters  late payment reminders and settlement offers that are sent out at specific intervals or at the request of a member of the collection department 
if the collection department cannot contact the customer by either telephone or mail  the account is skip traced through an automated process to obtain the most recent contact information for the customer 
this process employs usage of data supplied by a variety of third party databases 
once new contact information is obtained  the account is referred back to the collection department and collection activity is once again initiated 
other members of the collection department are responsible for coordinating customer inquiries and assisting the collection agencies in their processes  if needed  
table of contents handling the repurchase process of ineligible accounts received from a seller that may be included in a purchased portfolio  working with buyers during the transition period and post sale process  handling any issues that may arise once a purchased receivable portfolio is sold  and reading incoming correspondence for accounts that are currently assigned to the collection department  ensuring the account is handled properly  taking the initial action required and forwarding to a collector and or manager for follow up action 
other responsibilities of the collection department include media requests  dispute resolution and correspondence activities 
accounting and finance department in addition to the customary accounting activities  the accounting and finance department is responsible for making daily deposits of customer payments  posting payments to customers accounts  and providing senior management with daily  weekly and monthly receivable activity and performance reports 
accounting and finance employees assist collection department employees in handling customer disputes relating to payment and balance information and handling the repurchase requests from companies to whom we have sold receivables 
additionally  the accounting department reviews the results of the collection of consumer receivable portfolios that are being serviced by third party collection agencies and attorneys 
collections represented by account sales certain collections represent account sales to other debt buyers to help maximize revenue and cash flows 
we believe that our business model of not having a large number of collectors  coupled with a legal strategy which is focused on attempting to perfect liens and judgments against obligors  allows us the flexibility to sell accounts at prices that are attractive to us  and  just as important  sell the less desirable accounts within our collection portfolios 
there are many factors that contribute to the decision as to which receivable to sell and which to service  including the age of the receivable  the status of the receivable whether paying or non paying  and the selling price 
net collections represented by account sales for the fiscal years ended september   and were million  million and million  respectively 
collections represented by account sales as a percentage of total collections for the fiscal years ended september   and was   and  respectively 
marketing over the last three years our consumer debt portfolio purchases have been reduced to one portfolio purchase in fiscal year  however  we have maintained our established relationships with brokers who market consumer receivable portfolios from banks  finance companies and other credit providers 
in addition  we subscribe to national publications that list consumer receivable portfolios for sale 
we also directly contact banks  finance companies or other credit providers to solicit consumer receivables for sale 

table of contents competition our business of purchasing distressed consumer receivables is highly competitive and fragmented  and we expect that competition from new and existing companies will continue 
we compete with other purchasers of consumer receivables  including third party collection companies  and other financial services companies who purchase consumer receivables 
some of our competitors are larger and more established and may have substantially greater financial  technological  personnel and other resources than we have  including greater access to the credit and capital markets 
we believe that no individual competitor or group of competitors has a dominant presence in the market 
we compete in the marketplace for consumer receivable portfolios based on many factors  including purchase price  representations  warranties and indemnities requested  timeliness of purchase decisions  and reputation 
our strategy is designed to capitalize on the market s lack of a dominant industry player 
we believe that our management s experience and expertise in identifying  evaluating  pricing and acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and managing collections  coupled with our strategic alliances with third party collection agencies and attorneys and our sources of financing  give us a competitive advantage 
however  we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not increase in the future 
the litigation funding business is highly competitive and fragmented  and we expect that competition from new and existing companies will continue 
we compete in the litigation funding marketplace based on many factors  including cost of funds lent  application fee costs  broker s commissions and bonuses paid  reputation  and direct and on line marketing 
we believe that the managements of pegasus and bp case management have the expertise and experience in identifying  evaluating  pricing and acquisition of litigating funding cases 
however  we cannot assure that our litigation funding businesses will be able to compete against current or future competitors or that competition will not increase in the future 
seasonality and trends our management believes that our operations may  to some extent  be affected by high delinquency rates and by lower recoveries on consumer receivables acquired for liquidation during or shortly following certain holiday periods and during the summer months 
technology we believe that a high degree of automation is necessary to enable us to grow and successfully compete with other finance companies 
accordingly  we continually look to upgrade our technology systems to support the servicing and recovery of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation 
our telecommunications and technology systems allow us to quickly and accurately process large amounts of data necessary to purchase and service consumer receivable portfolios 
in addition  we rely on the information technology of our third party collection agencies and attorneys and periodically review their systems to ensure that they can adequately service the consumer receivable portfolios outsourced to them 

table of contents due to our desire to increase productivity through automation  we periodically review our systems for possible upgrades and enhancements 
government regulation our business is subject to extensive federal and state regulations 
the relationship of a consumer and a creditor is extensively regulated by federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and ordinances 
these laws include  but are not limited to  the following federal statutes and regulations the federal truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act fcba  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair credit reporting act fcra  as well as comparable statutes in states where consumers reside and or where creditors are located 
among other things  the laws and regulations applicable to various creditors impose disclosure requirements regarding the advertisement  application  establishment and operation of credit card accounts or other types of credit programs 
federal law requires a creditor to disclose to consumers  among other things  the interest rates  fees  grace periods and balance calculation methods associated with their accounts 
in addition  consumers are entitled to have payments and credits applied to their accounts promptly  to receive prescribed notices and to request that billing errors be resolved promptly 
in addition  some laws prohibit certain discriminatory practices in connection with the extension of credit 
further  state laws may limit the interest rate and the fees that a creditor may impose on consumers 
failure by the creditors to comply with applicable laws could create claims and rights of offset by consumers that would reduce or eliminate their obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
pursuant to agreements under which we purchase receivables  we are typically indemnified against losses resulting from the failure of the creditor to have complied with applicable laws relating to the receivables prior to our purchase of such receivables 
certain laws  including the laws described above  may limit our ability to collect amounts owing with respect to the receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part 
for example  under the fcba  a credit card issuer may be subject to certain claims and defenses arising out of certain transactions in which a credit card is used if the consumer has made a good faith attempt to obtain satisfactory resolution of a problem relative to the transaction and  except in cases where there is a specified relationship between the person honoring the card and the credit card issuer  the amount of the initial transaction exceeds and the place where the initial transaction occurred was in the same state as the consumer s billing address or within miles of that address 
accordingly  as a purchaser of defaulted receivables  we may purchase receivables subject to valid defenses on the part of the consumer 
other laws provide that  in certain instances  consumers cannot be held liable for  or their liability is limited to with respect to  charges to the credit card credit account that were a result of an unauthorized use of the credit card account 
no assurances can be given that certain of the receivables were not established as a result of unauthorized use of a credit card account  and  accordingly  the amount of such receivables may not be collectible by us 
several federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and ordinances  including  but not limited to  the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa and the federal trade commission act and comparable state statutes  regulate consumer debt collection activity 
although  for a variety of reasons  we may not be specifically subject to the fdcpa or certain state statutes that govern third party debt collectors  it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in our collection activities 
additionally  our third party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these laws 
to the extent that some or all of these laws apply to our collection activities or our third party collection agencies and attorneys collection activities  failure to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on us 
in order to comply with the foregoing laws and regulations  we provide a comprehensive development training program for our new collection dispute department representatives and on going training for all collection dispute department associates 
all collection and dispute representatives are tested annually on their knowledge of the fdcpa and other applicable laws 
account representatives not achieving our minimum standards are required to complete a fdcpa review session and are then retested 
in addition  annual supplemental instruction in the fdcpa and collection techniques is provided to all our account representatives 
on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and protection act  or the dodd frank act  was enacted 
there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the dodd 
table of contents frank act that require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in areas such as corporate governance  say on pay and proxy access 
our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  an increase in expenses and a diversion of management s time from other business activities 
we are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state governments  the public company accounting oversight board pcaob and nasdaq  all of which have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by congress 
the enactment of the dodd frank act will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation  and we cannot predict the effect of such regulation on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
through the dodd frank act  congress established the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb  which has regulatory  supervisory and enforcement authority over entities involved in consumer financial markets 
the cfpb has the authority to conduct periodic examinations of larger participants in each market  and we believe it is likely that we will be subject to an examination 
the cfpb published a final rule on october  that allows the agency to federally supervise the larger consumer debt collectors 
the cfpb also released the field guide that examiners will use to ensure that companies and banks engaging in debt collection are following the law 
the consumer debt collection market covered by the rule includes three main types of debt collectors first  firms that may buy defaulted debt and collect the proceeds for themselves  second  firms that may collect defaulted debt owned by another company in return for a fee  and third  debt collection attorneys that collect through litigation 
a single company may be involved in any or all of these activities 
the cfpb s supervisory authority over these entities began when the rule took effect on january  under the rule  any firm that has more than million in annual receipts from consumer debt collection activities will be subject to the cfpb s supervisory authority 
this authority will extend to about debt collectors  which  according to the cfpb  account for over percent of the industry s annual receipts in the consumer debt collection market 
pursuant to the cfpb s supervisory authority  examiners will be assessing potential risks to consumers and whether debt collectors are complying with requirements of federal consumer financial law 
among other things  examiners will be evaluating whether debt collectors provide required disclosures  use accurate information  maintain a consumer complaint and dispute resolution process  and communicate with consumers in the manner required by law 
the cfpb s general supervision and examination manual  as well as its examination manual specific to the debt collection market  provide guidance on how the bureau will be conducting its monitoring of debt collection activities 
examiners will evaluate the quality of the regulated entity s compliance management systems  review practices to ensure they comply with federal consumer financial law  and identify risks to consumers throughout the debt collection process 
the cfpb can seek relief that includes rescission or reformation of contracts  restitution  disgorgement of profits  payment of damages  limits on activities and civil money penalties of up to million per day for knowing violations 
as a company that engages in debt collection  we need to be prepared for the heavy oversight that the cfpb will bring 
preparing for a cfpb audit will cost time and money 
additionally  the cfpb has the power to bring an enforcement action or cause a required settlement 
another large concern is the amount of privileged and confidential information the cfpb could release  which can lead to private lawsuits including class and mass actions as well as other state and federal agency oversight 
the cfpb is expressly charged with prohibiting unfair  deceptive or abusive acts or practices 
through its broad powers to regulate and enforce federal consumer financial laws  the cfpb could place restrictions on our business  the businesses of our customers and the business of our affiliates  if the cfpb were to determine through rulemaking  supervisory or enforcement actions  for example  that particular acts or practices were unfair  deceptive or abusive to consumers 

table of contents the cfpb will thus exercise supervisory authority over us 
at this time  it is not possible or practical to attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of how these new laws and regulations may impact debt collectors 
additionally  the dodd frank act empowers state attorneys general or the equivalent thereof to bring civil actions in federal district court or a state court that is located in that state and that has jurisdiction over the defendant  to enforce title x of the act or regulations issued by the bureau thereunder 
therefore  we could also be the subject of investigations and enforcement actions by the federal trade commission or by state agencies eg  state attorneys general with powers to enforce bureau regulations and the fcra 
the dodd frank act authorized the cfpb to prescribe rules interpreting the fdcpa 
on november   the cfpb signaled its intention to promulgate substantive rules under the fdcpa by publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr with regard to debt collection practices 
the anpr requests comments with regard to a wide array of issues relating to debt collection 
consumers  consumer groups  debt collectors  industry representatives and others have days from the date of publication of the anpr in which to submit comments 
final rules will likely be issued within the next to months 
the company has and will continue to have a substantive compliance program and maintain procedures to ensure that the law is followed and that consumer complaints are dealt with in an appropriate fashion 
additional laws or amendments to existing laws  may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables 
such new laws or amendments may adversely affect our ability to collect the receivables 
we currently hold a number of licenses issued under applicable consumer credit laws or other licensing statutes or regulations 
certain of our current licenses  and any licenses that we may be required to obtain in the future  may be subject to periodic renewal provisions and or other requirements 
our inability to renew licenses or to take any other required action with respect to such licenses could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operation and financial condition 
the litigation funding business is becoming a growing focus for legislators and policy makers 
there are a variety of state laws in three substantive areas laws directly regulating funders  the arcane doctrines of maintenance  champerty  and barratry  and rules regulating attorney conduct and the application of attorney client privilege 
pegasus monitors the state regulations affecting its business in all states where it is currently active in litigation funding 
pegasus believes that it currently complies with all applicable laws in the jurisdictions where it invests in litigation cases 
it is also possible that congress could seek to impose rules  regulations and fees on participants in the litigation funding business 
we cannot predict the effect of any such regulation on our litigation funding business  results of operation or financial condition

the enactment of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation  and we cannot predict the effect of such regulation on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and protection act  or the dodd frank act  was enacted 
there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the dodd frank act that require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as say on pay and proxy access 
our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  an increase in expenses and a diversion of management s time from other business activities 
given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations  the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear 
the changes resulting from the dodd frank act may impact the profitability of business activities  require changes to certain business practices  or otherwise adversely affect our business 
in particular  the potential impact of the dodd frank act on our operations and activities  both currently and prospectively  include  among others increased cost of operations due to greater regulatory oversight  supervision and compliance with consumer debt issuance and collection practices  and the limitation on the ability to expand consumer product and service offerings due to anticipated stricter consumer protection laws and regulations 
the dodd frank act establishes the cfpb  which has broad regulatory powers over debt collectors and virtually all other covered persons who have any connection to consumer financial products or services 
the cfpb has exclusive rule making authority with respect to all significant federal statutes that impact the collection industry  including the fdcpa  the fcra  and others 
this means  for example  that the cfpb has the ability to pass rules and regulations that interpret any of the provisions of the fdcpa  potentially impacting all facets of the collection channel 
federal agencies  including the cfpb  have been given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations that will implement the dodd frank act 
consequently  many of the details and much of the impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for some time 
in addition  this legislation mandated multiple studies and reports for congress  which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
the cfpb has the authority to conduct periodic examinations of larger participants in each market  and we believe it is likely that we will be subject to an examination 
we cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted under the dodd frank act  the effect such regulations will have on financial markets generally  or on our businesses specifically  the additional 
table of contents costs associated with compliance with such regulations  or any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply with the dodd frank act  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
government regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our receivables 
federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and ordinances may limit our ability to recover and enforce our rights with respect to the receivables acquired by us 
these laws include  but are not limited to  the following federal statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder and comparable statutes in states where consumers reside and or where creditors are located the fair debt collection practices act  the federal trade commission act  the truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act  the financial privacy rule  the safeguards rule  telephone consumer protection act  health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa health information technology for economical and clinical health act hitech  us bankruptcy code  and credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of we may be precluded from collecting receivables we purchase where the creditor or other previous owner or third party collection agency or attorney failed to comply with applicable law in originating or servicing such acquired receivables 
laws relating to the collection of consumer debt also directly apply to our business 
our failure to comply with any laws applicable to us  including state licensing laws  could limit our ability to recover on receivables and could subject us to fines and penalties  which could reduce our earnings and result in a default under our loan arrangements 
in addition  our third party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these and other laws and their failure to comply with such laws could also materially adversely affect our finance income and earnings 
additional laws or amendments to existing laws may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables 
such new laws or amendments may adversely affect the ability to collect on our receivables  which could also adversely affect our finance income and earnings 
because our receivables are generally originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal  state and or local laws by a variety of entities and may involve consumers in all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and south america  there can be no assurance that all originating and servicing entities have  at all times  been in substantial compliance with applicable law 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we or our third party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law 
failure to comply with applicable law could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs  fines and penalties 
we are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the nasdaq global market  have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by congress 

table of contents the current economic environment has slowed our ability to collect from our customers 
the recent worldwide financial turmoil has adversely affected all businesses  including our own 
the current collection environment is particularly challenging as a result of factors in the economy over which we have no control 
these factors include a slowdown in the economy  severe problems in the credit and housing markets  higher unemployment  reductions in consumer spending  changes in the underwriting criteria by originators  and changes in laws and regulations governing consumer lending and the related collections 
our litigation strategy is highly dependent on our ability to locate customers with jobs and or homes 
we believe that our customers are straining to pay their obligations owed to us 
higher unemployment rates particularly impact our customers ability to pay obligations and our ability to get wage executions as a source of payment 
problems in the credit markets and lower home values have reduced the ability of our customers to secure financing through second mortgages and home equity lines to pay obligations owed to us 
a continuation of the current problems in the credit and housing markets and general slowdown in the economy will continue to adversely affect the effectiveness of our litigation strategy  and the value of our portfolios and our financial performance 
we are subject to various risks in connection with our litigation funding business 
risks of the litigation funding business include the potential regulation or limitation of interest rates and other fees advanced by our litigation funding subsidiaries under federal and or state regulation  a change in statutory or case law which limits or restricts the ability of our litigation funding subsidiaries to charge or collect fees and interest at anticipated levels  claimants being unsuccessful in whole or in part in the personal injury claims or divorce settlement upon which our funds are provided  the continued services of the senior management of our litigation funding subsidiaries to source and analyze cases in accordance with the subsidiaries respective underwriting guidelines 
we may not be able to purchase consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices or on sufficiently favorable terms if at all 
our success depends upon the continued availability of consumer receivable portfolios that meet our purchasing criteria and our ability to identify and finance the purchases of such portfolios 
the availability of consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices and on terms acceptable to us  if at all  depends on a number of factors outside of our control  including the growth in consumer debt  the volume of consumer receivable portfolios available for sale  availability of financing to fund purchases  competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and sellers of consumer receivable portfolios  and possible future changes in the bankruptcy laws  state laws and homestead acts which could make it more difficult for us to collect 
our future operating results will be negatively impacted as we have not replaced our defaulted consumer receivables at historic levels 
to operate profitably  we must continually acquire  or invest in a sufficient level of various types of receivables to generate continued revenue 
our investment in charged off consumer receivables during fiscal year   and has slowed dramatically 
as the economic environment deteriorated  we felt that pricing of 
table of contents portfolios had not fallen enough to offset the decline in ultimate collections 
accordingly  our investment in portfolios was million in  million in  and million in compared to million in and million in in part  this led to our net cash collections in fiscal decreasing million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year furthermore  of those collections  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year came from zero basis portfolios whose carrying value has been reduced to zero 
our decreased level of buying new portfolios during fiscal years   and will likely result in future reduced net cash collections in fiscal year and slow the growth of our future revenues and operating results in the consumer debt part of our business 
furthermore  we cannot predict how our ability to identify and invest in receivables  and evaluate the quality of those receivables  would be affected if there is a shift in consumer lending practices whether caused by changes in regulations or by a sustained economic downturn 
our inability to invest in sufficient quantities of receivables portfolios may necessitate workforce reductions  which may harm our business 
because fixed costs  such as personnel costs  constitute a significant portion of our overhead  we may be required to reduce the number of employees if we do not continually invest in receivables 
reducing the number of employees can adversely affect our business and lead to lower employee morale  higher employee attrition rates  and fewer experienced employees  disruptions in our operations and loss of efficiency in collection functions  excess costs associated with unused space in collection facilities  and further reliance on our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
we have risks associated with the portfolio purchase  which has not met our expectations and may continue to adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
since the inception of the portfolio purchase  financed by the receivables financing agreement  the receivables financing agreement has been modified five times due to collections not meeting our expectations 
the shortfall was exacerbated by the general economic downturn 
we have recorded impairments on the portfolio purchase totaling million million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year 
the portfolio purchase was transferred to the cost recovery method effective with the third quarter of fiscal year  as collections became increasingly more difficult to predict 
accordingly  we will recognize finance income only after we recover the carrying value of the asset 
as a result  finance income since april  has been and will continue to be negatively impacted 
there can be no assurance as to when or if the current carrying value will be recovered 
the carrying value of the portfolio purchase as of september  is million 
there is no assurance that we will realize the full value of the deferred tax asset 
although the carry forward period for income taxes is up to twenty years  such allowance period is outside a reasonable period to forecast full realization of the deferred tax asset 
we continually monitor forecast information to ensure the valuation allowance is appropriate 
with portfolios classified under the interest method  our projections of future cash flows from our portfolio purchases may prove to be inaccurate  which could result in reduced revenues or the recording of impairment charges if we do not achieve the collections forecasted by our model 
in addition  portfolios classified under the cost method may experience shortfalls in collections that may result in further impairments write downs 
we use qualitative and quantitative analyses to project future cash flows from our portfolio purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to achieve the collections forecasted by our analysis 
if we are not able to achieve these levels of forecasted collections  our revenues will be reduced and we may be required to 
table of contents record additional impairment charges  which would result in a reduction of our earnings 
we recorded impairment charges of million  million  and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
as the mix of our portfolios has shifted to the cost recovery method  there is a negative impact on finance income as no finance income is recognized on the cost recovery portfolios until the carrying value has been recovered 
historically  we have utilized the interest method to recognize finance income on most consumer receivable portfolios purchased 
as the economy has impacted our business  making collections more unpredictable  we have transferred portfolios from the interest method to the cost recovery method  which delays the recognition of finance income until the carrying value has been fully recovered 
we use estimates for recognizing finance income on a portion of our consumer receivables acquired for liquidation and our earnings would be reduced if actual results are less than estimated 
we utilize the interest method of revenue recognition for determining a portion of our finance income recognized  which is based on projected cash flows that may prove to be less than anticipated and could lead to reductions in revenue or additional impairment charges under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc  receivables loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality asc 
static pools of accounts are established 
these pools are aggregated based on certain common risk criteria 
each static pool is recorded at cost and is accounted for as a single unit for the recognition of income  principal payments and loss provision 
once a static pool is established for a quarter  individual receivable accounts are not added to the pool unless replaced by the seller or removed from the pool unless sold or returned to the seller 
asc requires that the excess of the contractual cash flows over expected cash flows not be recognized as an adjustment of revenue or expense or on the balance sheet 
asc initially freezes the internal rate of return irr  estimated when the accounts receivable are purchased  as the basis for subsequent impairment testing 
significant increases in actual  or expected future cash flows may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the irr over a portfolio s remaining life 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing 
rather than lowering the estimated irr  if the collection estimates are not received or projected to be received  the carrying value of a pool would be written down to maintain the then current irr 
any reduction in our earnings resulting from such a write down could materially adversely affect our stock price 
we may not be able to collect sufficient amounts on our consumer receivable portfolios to recover the costs associated with the purchase of those portfolios and to fund our operations 
we acquire and collect on consumer receivable portfolios that contain charged off  semi performing  and performing receivables 
in order to operate profitably over the long term  we must continually purchase and collect on a sufficient volume of receivables to generate revenue that exceeds our purchase costs 
for accounts that are charged off or semi performing  the originators or interim owners of the receivables generally have made numerous attempts to collect on these obligations  often using both their in house collection staff and third party collection agencies  and subsequently deemed these obligations as uncollectible 
these receivable portfolios are purchased at significant discounts to the amount the consumers owe 
these receivables are difficult to collect and actual recoveries may be less than the amount expected 
in addition  our collections may worsen in a weak economic cycle 
we may not recover amounts in excess of our acquisition and servicing costs 
our ability to recover the purchase costs on our portfolios and produce sufficient returns can be negatively impacted by the quality of the purchased receivables 
in the normal course of our portfolio acquisitions  some receivables may be included in the portfolios that fail to conform to certain terms of the purchase agreements and we may seek to return these receivables to the seller for payment or replacement receivables 
however  we can 
table of contents not guarantee that any of such sellers will be able to meet their payment obligations to us 
accounts that we are unable to return to sellers may yield no return 
if cash flows from operations are less than anticipated as a result of our inability to collect sufficient amounts on our receivables  our ability to satisfy our debt obligations  purchase new portfolios  and achieve future growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to competition for the purchase of consumer receivable portfolios which could result in an increase in prices of such portfolios 
we compete with other purchasers of consumer receivable portfolios  with third party collection agencies and with financial services companies that manage their own consumer receivable portfolios 
we compete on the basis of price  reputation  industry experience and performance 
some of our competitors have greater capital  personnel and other resources than we have 
the possible entry of new competitors  including competitors that historically have focused on the acquisition of different asset types  and the expected increase in competition from current market participants may reduce our access to consumer receivable portfolios 
aggressive pricing by our competitors has raised the price of consumer receivable portfolios above levels that we are willing to pay  which could reduce the number of consumer receivable portfolios suitable for us to purchase or if purchased by us  reduce the profits  if any  generated by such portfolios 
if we are unable to purchase receivable portfolios at favorable prices or at all  our finance income and earnings could be materially reduced 
we depend upon third parties to service a portion of our consumer receivable portfolios 
the loss of certain servicers could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation 
although we utilize our in house collection staff to initiate the collection process to collect some of our receivables  we outsource a majority of our receivable servicing 
as of our portfolio face value is serviced by seven organizations  we are dependent upon the efforts of these collection agencies and attorneys to service and collect our consumer receivables 
any failure by our third party collection agencies and attorneys to adequately perform collection services for us or remit such collections to us could materially reduce our finance income and our profitability 
in addition  our finance income and profitability could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to secure replacement third party collection agencies and attorneys and redirect payments from the customers to our new third party collection agencies and attorneys promptly in the event our agreements with our third party collection agencies and attorneys are terminated  our third party collection agencies and attorneys fail to adequately perform their obligations or if our relationships with such third party collection agencies and attorneys adversely change 
we rely on our third party collectors to comply with all rules and regulations and maintain proper internal controls over their accounting and operations 
because the receivables were originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal and or state laws by a variety of entities and involved consumers in all states  the district of columbia  panama and puerto rico there can be no assurance that all original servicing entities have  at all times  been in substantial compliance with applicable law 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we or our third party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law 
the failure to comply with applicable law and not maintain proper controls in their accounting and operations could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs  fines and penalties 
we may rely on third parties to locate  identify and evaluate consumer receivable portfolios available for purchase 
we may rely on third parties  including brokers and third party collection agencies and attorneys  to identify consumer receivable portfolios and  in some instances  to assist us in our evaluation and purchase of these portfolios 
as a result  if such third parties fail to identify receivable portfolios or if our relationships with such third parties are not maintained  our ability to identify and purchase additional receivable portfolios could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if we  or such parties  fail to correctly or adequately evaluate the value or collectability of these consumer receivable portfolios  we may pay too much for such portfolios and suffer an impairment  which would negatively impact our earnings 

table of contents our collections may decrease if bankruptcy filings increase 
during times of economic recession  the amount of defaulted consumer receivables generally increases  which contributes to an increase in the amount of personal bankruptcy filings 
under certain bankruptcy filings  a debtor s assets are sold to repay credit originators  but since the defaulted consumer receivables we purchase are generally unsecured  we may not be able to collect on those receivables 
our collections may decline with an increase in bankruptcy filings 
if our actual collection experience with respect to a defaulted consumer receivable portfolio is significantly lower than we projected when we purchased the portfolio  our earnings could be negatively affected 
the loss of any of our executive officers may adversely affect our operations and our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios 
gary stern  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  robert j 
michel  our chief financial officer  and mary curtin  our senior vice president  are responsible for making substantially all management decisions  including determining which portfolios to purchase  the purchase price and other material terms of such portfolio acquisitions 
these decisions are instrumental to the success of our business 
as of january  arthur stern  former chairman of the board of directors  now chairman emeritus  stepped down as an employee of the company 
mr 
stern continues to serve on the board of directors and consults with our executives 
significant losses of the services of our executive officers or the inability to replace our officers with individuals who have experience in the industry or with the company could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios 
the stern family effectively controls the company  substantially reducing the influence of our other stockholders 
members of the stern family own directly or indirectly  approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result  the stern family is able to significantly influence the actions that require stockholder approval  including the election of our directors  and the approval of mergers  sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval 
as a result  our other stockholders may have reduced influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval 
in addition  the stern family s influence could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and  consequently  materially adversely affect the price of our common stock 
an unfavorable government review of our tax returns could adversely affect our operating results 
our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the irs and state and local taxing authorities 
in april  we received notification from the internal revenue service irs that our and federal income tax returns would be audited 
this audit is currently in progress 
the irs examinations of our federal tax returns could result in significant proposed adjustments 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
in addition  the company signed a consent to extend the irs review period through negative press regarding the debt collection industry may have a negative impact on a customer s willingness to pay the debt we acquire 
consumers are exposed to information from a number of sources that may cause them to be more reluctant to pay their debts or to pursue legal actions against us 
on line  print and other media publish stories about the debt collection industry which cite specific examples of abusive collection practices 
these stories can lead to the rapid dissemination of the story  adding to the level of exposure to negative publicity about our industry 
various 
table of contents internet sites are maintained where consumers can list their concerns about the activities of debt collectors and seek guidance from other website posters on how to handle the situation 
advertisements by debt relief attorneys and credit counseling centers are becoming more common  adding to the negative attention given to our industry 
as a result of this negative publicity  customers may be more reluctant to pay their debts or could pursue legal action against us regardless of whether those actions are warranted 
these actions could impact our ability to collect on the receivables we acquire and affect our revenues and profitability 
class action suits and other litigation could divert our management s attention from operating our business and increase our expenses 
originators  debt purchasers and third party collection agencies and attorneys in the consumer credit industry are frequently subject to putative class action lawsuits and other litigation 
claims include failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and improper or deceptive origination and servicing practices 
being a defendant in such class action lawsuits or other litigation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may seek to make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources 
we may seek to grow through acquisitions of related businesses in the financial services sector 
such acquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance  including the diversion of our management s attention from our everyday business activities  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business  the contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of  and other unanticipated problems arising in  the acquired business  and the need to expand management  administration and operational systems 
if we make such acquisitions  we cannot predict whether we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses into our business  we will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions  or there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions 
in addition  future acquisitions by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  and the recognition of significant charges for depreciation and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
if our technology and phone systems are not operational  our operations could be disrupted and our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios and receive collections from customers could be adversely affected 
our success depends  in part  on sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems 
the temporary loss of our computer or telecommunications systems  through casualty  operating malfunction or service provider failure  could disrupt our operations 
in addition  we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly bid on prospective acquisitions of receivable portfolios and to access  maintain and expand the databases we use for our collection and monitoring activities 
any failure of our information systems and their backup systems would interrupt our operations 
we may not have adequate backup arrangements for all of our operations and we may incur significant losses if an outage occurs 
in addition  we rely on third party collection agencies and attorneys who also may be adversely affected in the event of an outage in which the third party collection agencies and attorneys do not have adequate backup arrangements 
any interruption in our 
table of contents operations or our third party collection agencies and attorneys operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
however  we are in the process of implementing a disaster recovery program which would mitigate this risk 
a cyber security incident could have a negative effect on our business as we outsource a significant amount of the collection accounts with personal information electronically 
a security breach could have a detrimental effect on our business as we maintain a significant amount of personal information in our electronic files 
a breach of our system or a leak of the personal information we maintain could leave us vulnerable to  among other things  loss of information and potential litigation each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our organizational documents and delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our board of directors and management 
several provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt  including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock 
under the terms of our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
the ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current board of directors 
in addition  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of our common stock 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan which is intended to protect us from efforts to obtain control of us that are inconsistent with our best interests and the interests of our stockholders 
the rights will be exercisable ten days following the earlier of the public announcement that a stockholder has acquired or more of our common stock without board approval or the announcement of a tender offer which results in the ownership of or more of our common stock 
if the rights become exercisable  all rights holders other than the person triggering the rights will be entitled to acquire our securities at a substantial discount 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take over the company without the approval of our board of directors  the rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with the board of directors 
future sales of our common stock by our affiliates or other stockholders may depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of december  of these shares   are owned by our affiliates 
in addition  options to purchase  shares of our common stock were outstanding as of september   of which  were exercisable 
we may also issue additional shares in connection with our business and may grant additional stock options or restricted shares to our employees  officers  directors and consultants under our present or future equity compensation plans or we may issue warrants to third parties outside of such plans 
as of september   there were  shares available for such purpose with such shares available under the stock option and performance award plan 
if a significant portion of these shares were sold in the public market  the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected 
we have the ability to issue preferred shares  warrants  convertible debt and other securities without stockholder approval which could dilute the relative ownership interest of current stockholders and adversely affect our share price 
future sales of our equity related securities in the public market  including sales of our common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement  could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our 
table of contents ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
our common shares may be subordinate to classes of preferred shares issued in the future in the payment of dividends and other distributions made with respect to common shares  including distributions upon liquidation or dissolution 
our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue preferred shares without first obtaining stockholder approval 
if we issued preferred shares  these additional securities may have dividend or liquidation preferences senior to our common shares 
if we issue convertible preferred shares  a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders interest 
we have similar abilities to issue convertible debt  warrants and other equity securities 
climate change and related regulatory responses may adversely impact our business 
climate change as a result of emissions of greenhouse gases is a significant topic of discussion and may generate federal and other regulatory responses in the near future  including the imposition of a so called cap and trade system 
it is impracticable to predict with any certainty the impact on our business of climate change or the regulatory responses to it  although we recognize that they could be significant 
the most direct impact is likely to be an increase in energy costs  which would increase slightly our operating costs  primarily through increased utility and transportations costs 
in addition  increased energy costs could impact consumers and their ability to incur and repay indebtedness 
however  it is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact  either directionally or quantitatively  of climate change and related regulatory responses 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline 
because of the nature of our business  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our results may fluctuate as a result of any of the following the timing and amount of collections on our consumer receivable portfolios  our inability to identify and acquire additional consumer receivable portfolios  a decline in the estimated future value of our consumer receivable portfolio recoveries  increases in operating expenses associated with the growth of our operations  general and economic market conditions  and prices we are willing to pay for consumer receivable portfolios

caution regarding forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
all forward looking statements included in this annual report on form k are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and except as required by law  we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under the caption risk factors contained in this report and elsewhere herein 
the following should be read in conjunction with our annual financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we are primarily engaged in the business of acquiring  managing  servicing and recovering on portfolios of consumer receivables  and  through pegasus funding  llc  and bp case management  llc  funding of personal injury and matrimonial litigation claims  respectively 
consumer receivables the consumer receivable portfolios generally consist of one or more of the following types of consumer receivables charged off receivables accounts that have been written off by the originators and may have been previously serviced by collection agencies  semi performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making partial or irregular monthly payments  but the accounts may have been written off by the originators  and performing receivables in limited circumstances accounts where the debtor is making regular monthly payments that may or may not have been delinquent in the past 
we acquire these consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the amount actually owed by the borrowers 
we acquire these portfolios after a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying receivables and calculate the purchase price so that our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our investment after servicing expenses 
after purchasing a portfolio  we actively monitor its performance and review and adjust our collection and servicing strategies accordingly 
we purchase receivables from credit grantors and others through privately negotiated direct sales  brokered transactions and auctions in which sellers of receivables seek bids from several pre qualified debt purchasers 
we pursue new acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios on an ongoing basis through our relationships with industry participants  financial institutions  collection agencies  investors and our financing sources  brokers who specialize in the sale of consumer receivable portfolios  and other sources 
litigation funding in december  we entered into a joint venture with plf pursuant to which we purchase interests in personal injury claims from claimants who are a party to personal injury litigation  with the expectation of a settlement in the future 
through the joint venture  we advance  to each personal injury claimant  funds on a non recourse basis  at an agreed upon interest rate  in anticipation of a future settlement 
the interest purchased by us in each claim consists of the right to receive from such claimant part of the proceeds or recoveries which such claimant receives by reason of a settlement  judgment or award with respect to such claimant s claim 
open case revenue is estimated  recognized and accrued at a rate based on the expected realization and underwriting guidelines and facts and circumstances for each individual case 

table of contents when a case is closed and the cash is received for the advance provided to a claimant  revenue is recognized based upon the contractually agreed upon interest rate and  if applicable  adjusted for any changes due to a settled amount and fees charged to the claimant 
in may  we entered into a joint venture with balance point management 
the joint venture  through a newly formed indirect subsidiary  balance point  provides non recourse funding to claimants in matrimonial actions 
such funds can be used for legal fees  expert costs and necessary living expenses 
the venture will receive an agreed percentage of the proceeds received by such claimant upon final resolution of the case 
balance point s profits and losses will be distributed to us and to balance point management  after the return of our investment  on a case by case basis  and after a preferred return to us 
should the preferred return be less than on any million tranche  the profit and loss split would be adjusted to reflect our priority to a preferred return 
critical accounting policies we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios  using either the interest method  or the cost recovery method 
as we believe our extensive liquidating experience in certain asset classes such as distressed credit card receivables  consumer loan receivables and mixed consumer receivables has matured  we use the interest method when we believe we can reasonably estimate the timing of the cash flows 
in those situations where we diversify our acquisitions into other asset classes in which we do not possess the same expertise or history  or we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the cash flows  we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting for those portfolios of receivables 
we account for our investment in finance receivables using the interest method under the guidance of asc static pools of accounts are established 
these pools are aggregated based on certain common risk criteria 
each static pool is recorded at cost and is accounted for as a single unit for the recognition of income  principal payments and loss provision 
we currently consider for aggregation portfolios of accounts  purchased within the same fiscal quarter  that generally have the following characteristics same issuer originator  same underlying credit quality  similar geographic distribution of the accounts  similar age of the receivable  and same type of asset class credit cards  telecommunications  etc after determining that an investment will yield an adequate return on our acquisition cost after servicing fees  including court costs  which are expensed as incurred  we use a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the estimated cash flows 
the following variables are analyzed and factored into our original estimates the number of collection agencies previously attempting to collect the receivables in the portfolio  the average balance of the receivables  the age of the receivables as older receivables might be more difficult to collect or might be less cost effective  past history of performance of similar assets as we purchase portfolios of similar assets  we believe we have built significant history on how these receivables will liquidate and cash flow  number of months since charge off  
table of contents payments made since charge off  the credit originator and their credit guidelines  the locations of the customers as there are better states to attempt to collect in and ultimately we have better predictability of the liquidations and the expected cash flows  financial wherewithal of the seller  jobs or property of the customers found within portfolios with our business model 
customers with jobs or property are more likely to repay their obligation and conversely  customers without jobs or property are less likely to repay their obligation  and the ability to obtain customer statements from the original issuer 
we will obtain and utilize as appropriate input including  but not limited to  monthly collection projections and liquidation rates  from our third party collection agencies and attorneys  as further evidentiary matter  to assist us in developing collection strategies and in modeling the expected cash flows for a given portfolio 
we acquire accounts that have experienced deterioration of credit quality between origination and the date of our acquisition of the accounts 
the amount paid for a portfolio of accounts reflects our determination that it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the portfolio of accounts contractual terms 
we consider the expected payments and estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows for each acquired portfolio coupled with expected cash flows from accounts available for sales 
the excess of this amount over the cost of the portfolio  representing the excess of the account s cash flows expected to be collected over the amount paid  is accreted into income recognized on finance receivables over the expected remaining life of the portfolio 
we believe we have significant experience in acquiring certain distressed consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the amount actually owed by underlying customers 
we acquire these portfolios only after both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the underlying receivables are performed and a calculated purchase price is paid so that we believe our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our acquisition costs including servicing expenses 
additionally  when considering larger portfolio purchases of accounts  or portfolios from issuers from whom we have little or limited experience  we have the added benefit of soliciting our third party collection agencies and attorneys for their input on liquidation rates and at times incorporate such input into the price we offer for a given portfolio and the estimates we use for our expected cash flows 
as a result of the current challenging economic environment and the impact it has had on collections  for the non medical account portfolio purchases acquired since the beginning of fiscal year  we extended our time frame of the expectation of recovering of our invested capital to a month period from an month period  and the expectation of recovering over seven years from the previous five year expectation 
the time frame of expectations has remained in force for fiscal year we routinely monitor these expectations against the actual cash flows and  in the event the cash flows are below our expectations and we believe there are no reasons relating to mere timing differences or explainable delays such as can occur particularly when the court system is involved for the reduced collections  an impairment is recorded on portfolios accounted for under the interest method 
conversely  in the event the cash flows are in excess of our expectations and the reason is due to timing  we would defer the excess collection as deferred revenue 
we use the cost recovery method when collections on a particular pool of accounts cannot be reasonably predicted 
under the cost recovery method  no finance income is recognized until the cost of the portfolio has been fully recovered 
a pool can become fully amortized zero carrying balance on the balance sheet while still generating cash collections 
in this case  all cash collections are recognized as finance income when received 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations

for the year ended september   finance income decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily due to the lower level of portfolio purchases over the last three years and  as a result  an increased percentage of our portfolio balances are in the later stages of their yield curves

commissions and fees associated with gross collections from our third party collection agencies and attorneys decreased million  or as compared to the same period in the prior year and averaged of collections for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to in the same prior year period 
the higher rate was the result of higher collections of higher commissioned out of statute paper coupled with increased asset search costs in the current fiscal year 
further  as we have curtailed our purchases of new portfolios of consumer receivables in the last three fiscal years  finance income was negatively impacted and we expect will continue to be negatively impacted going forward since we have not been replacing our receivables acquired for liquidation 
instead  we focused on reducing our debt and being highly disciplined in our portfolio purchases 
we continue to review potential portfolio acquisitions regularly and will purchase such portfolios when we believe the purchase will yield our desired rate of return  as we did with the purchase of a consumer debt portfolio during the fiscal year there were no accretable yield adjustments recorded during the fiscal years ended september  and

commissions and fees associated with gross collections from our third party collection agencies and attorneys decreased million  or as compared to the same period in the prior year and averaged of collections for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to in the same prior year period 
the lower rate was the result of a one time million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that impacted commissions and fees 
further  as we have curtailed our purchases of new portfolios of consumer receivables in the last three fiscal years  finance income was negatively impacted and we expect will continue to be negatively impacted going forward since we have not been replacing our receivables acquired for liquidation 
instead  we focused on reducing our debt and being highly disciplined in our portfolio purchases

net income per diluted share for the year ended september  decreased slightly to per diluted share down from per diluted share for the year ended september  liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash from operations is collections on the receivable portfolios we have acquired 
our primary uses of cash include repayments of debt  our purchases of consumer receivable portfolios  interest payments  costs involved in the collections of consumer receivables  taxes and dividends  if approved

receivables financing agreement in march  palisades xvi borrowed approximately million under the receivables financing agreement  as amended  in order to finance the portfolio purchase 
the portfolio purchase had a purchase price of million plus of net payments after palisades xvi recovers of its purchase price plus cost of funds  which recovery has not yet occurred 
prior to the modification  discussed below  the debt was full recourse only to palisades xvi and bore an interest rate of approximately basis points over libor 
the original term of the agreement was three years 
this term was extended by each of the second  third  fourth and fifth amendments to the receivables financing agreement as discussed below 
the portfolio purchase is serviced by palisades collection llc  our wholly owned subsidiary which has engaged unaffiliated subservicers for a majority of the portfolio purchase 
since the inception of the receivables financing agreement  amendments have been signed to revise various terms of the receivables financing agreement

senior secured discretionary credit facility on december   we and certain of our subsidiaries obtained a  senior secured discretionary credit facility the credit facility from bank leumi pursuant to a loan agreement the loan agreement between certain of our subsidiaries and bank leumi 
under the loan agreement  certain of our subsidiaries issued a revolving note to bank leumi in the principal amount of up to  any outstanding balance under the credit facility accrues interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate plus basis points 
the credit facility was not utilized and expired on february  litigation funding during fiscal  we entered into joint ventures with aph and balance point management relating to the funding of personal injury and matrimonial claims 
for a more detailed description of our litigation funding operations  see the section entitled litigation funding business under item business 
as of the date of this report  we have invested million and million in the aph and balance point management joint ventures  respectively 
we have also provided a million revolving line of credit to partially fund balance point management s operations 
the line of credit accrues interest at the prevailing prime rate and has an initial term of twenty four months  which may be extended under certain circumstances for an additional month period 
the revolving line of credit is collateralized by balance point management s share of the profits in our joint venture and other assets

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  the increase is primarily due to higher net income  net of non cash impairment charges and lower tax payments  partially offset by a decrease in due from third party collection agencies and attorneys 
net cash provided by investing activities was million during the fiscal year ended september   as compared to net cash used in investing activities of million during the fiscal year ended september  the change in cash provided by used in investing activities is primarily due to the investing activity in other than cash and cash equivalents depository accounts and lower collections of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation during the year ended september  as compared to the same period 
we increased our investment in available for sale securities and investments in personal injury claims 
net cash used in financing activities was million during the fiscal year ended september   as compared to million in the same period 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in the pay down of the non recourse debt offset by lower purchases of treasury stock in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior period 
our cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant and have  in the past  depended on external financing to acquire consumer receivables and operate the business 
significant requirements include repayments under our non recourse debt facilities  investment in personal injury claims  costs involved in the collections of consumer receivables  and investment in consumer receivable portfolios 
in addition  dividends are paid if approved by the board of directors 
acquisitions recently have been financed through cash flows from operating activities 
we believe we will be less dependent on a credit facility in the short term  as our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to invest in personal injury claims  purchase portfolios and operate the business 
however  as the collection environment remains challenging  we may seek additional funding 
we believe our available cash resources and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months 
we do not expect to incur any material capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
we are cognizant of the current market fundamentals in the debt purchase and company acquisition markets which  because of significant supply and tight capital availability  could result in increased buying opportunities 
the outcome of any future transaction s is subject to market conditions 
in addition  due to these opportunities  we continue to seek opportunities with banking organizations and others on a possible financing loan facility

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
income taxes topic presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
there is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in those instances 
some entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in  or that resulted in  the 
table of contents recognition of a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward for that year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized 
other entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward in certain circumstances 
the objective of the amendments in this update is to eliminate that diversity in practice 
this standard becomes effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the company is reviewing the affects of implementation of this standard 
in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments require an entity to present  either in the income statement or the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that might provide additional details about the amounts 
this asu was effective for annual and interim periods beginning january  adoption of the asu did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements see note investments 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended september   and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes and changes in corporate tax rates 
a material change in these rates could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
at september   our receivables financing agreement  under the new settlement agreement  all of which is variable rate debt  had an outstanding balance of million 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately  based on the average debt obligation outstanding during the fiscal year
