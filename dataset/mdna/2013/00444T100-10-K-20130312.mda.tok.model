table of contents part i item business overview we are a development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of acute and breakthrough pain 
our lead product candidate  the sufentanil nanotab pca system  or the nanotab system or arx  is designed to improve the management of moderate to severe acute post operative pain in patients in the hospital setting 
although widely used  the current standard of care for patients with post operative pain  intravenous patient controlled analgesia  or iv pca  has been shown to cause harm and inconvenience to patients following surgery because of the side effects of commonly used iv pca opioids  the invasive iv needle route of delivery and the inherent potential for programming and delivery errors associated with the complexity of infusion pumps 
the sufentanil nanotab pca system the sufentanil nanotab pca system is an investigational pre programmed  non invasive  handheld system that allows post operative patients to self dose with sublingual sufentanil nanotabs to manage their post operative pain 
the nanotab system is designed to address the limitations of iv pca by offering a high therapeutic index opioid the nanotab system uses the high therapeutic index opioid sufentanil  it offers post operative pain patients the potential for effective patient controlled analgesia with a low incidence of drug related side effects 
a non invasive route of delivery the sublingual route of delivery used by the nanotab system provides rapid onset of analgesia  therefore eliminating the risk of iv related analgesic gaps and iv complications  such as catheter related infections 
in addition  because patients are not tethered to iv tubing and a pump for pain relief  the nanotab system allows for ease of patient mobility 
a simple  pre programmed pca solution the nanotab system is a pre programmed pca system designed to eliminate the risk of pump programming errors 
our phase clinical program for the nanotab system consists of two placebo controlled efficacy and safety trials and an open label active comparator trial  in which the nanotab system was compared to iv pca 
a summary of phase trials and results to date is as follows in march  we reported top line data showing that the primary endpoint was achieved in a pivotal  double blind  placebo controlled  phase trial of the nanotab system for acute post operative pain in major open abdominal surgery patients 
in november  we reported top line data showing that the primary endpoint of non inferiority was met in an open label active comparator phase clinical trial 
in the second quarter of  we expect data from our final planned phase trial  a pivotal  double blind  placebo controlled efficacy and safety trial in patients with acute post operative pain following hip and knee replacement surgeries 
arx we are also developing a sufentanil single dose nanotab  or arx  for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain on the battlefield  in the emergency room or in ambulatory care facilities 
in may  we announced that the us army medical research and materiel command  or usamrmc  awarded us a million grant to support the development of arx for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain 
in november  we initiated a phase placebo controlled  dose finding trial and  in february  dosing of the last patient in this trial was completed 
this trial enrolled patients and top line results from the trial are expected during the second quarter of 
table of contents in addition to our nanotab system and arx  our product candidate pipeline consists of two other sufentanil based product candidates 
the sufentanil nanotab btp management system  or arx  is a pain management system for the treatment of cancer patients who suffer from breakthrough pain  or btp 
the sufentanil triazolam nanotab  or arx  is a single  fixed dose product designed to provide mild sedation  anxiety reduction and pain relief for patients undergoing painful procedures in a physician s office 
we have successfully completed phase clinical trials for arx and arx future development of arx and arx is contingent on identification of corporate partnership resources 
we were originally incorporated as surx  inc in delaware on july  we subsequently changed our name to acelrx pharmaceuticals  inc on august  sufentanil nanotabs sufentanil  a high therapeutic index opioid  which has no active metabolites  is to times more potent than fentanyl and is used intravenously as a primary anesthetic to produce balanced general anesthesia for surgery  and for epidural administration during labor and delivery 
sufentanil has many pharmacological advantages over other opioids 
published studies demonstrate that sufentanil produces significantly less respiratory depressive effects relative to its analgesic effects compared to other opioids  including morphine  alfentanil and fentanyl 
these third party clinical results correlate well with preclinical trials demonstrating sufentanil s high therapeutic index  or the ratio of the toxic dose to the therapeutic dose of a drug  used as a measure of the relative safety of the drug for a particular treatment 
accordingly  we believe that sufentanil can be developed to provide an effective and well tolerated treatment for acute and breakthrough pain 
the following table illustrates the difference between the therapeutic index of different opioids 
opioid therapeutic index meperidine methadone morphine hydromorphone fentanyl sufentanil in addition  the pharmaceutical attributes of sufentanil  including lipid solubility and ionization  result in rapid cell membrane penetration and onset of action  which we believe make sufentanil an optimal opioid for the treatment of both acute pain and breakthrough pain 
although the analgesic efficacy and safety of sufentanil have been well established  the product s use has been historically limited due to its short duration of action when delivered intravenously 
we believe that sublingual delivery of sufentanil avoids the high peak plasma levels and short duration of action of iv administration 

table of contents our portfolio of product candidates leverages the inherent advantages of sufentanil that are underutilized in medical practice 
we believe our non invasive  proprietary nanotab sublingual dosage form overcomes the limitations of the current treatment options available for both acute and breakthrough pain 
logo none of our product candidates have been approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates 
sublingual delivery of sufentanil summary of phase clinical studies results we have completed four phase pk studies with our proprietary sublingual sufentanil nanotabs to support our four product candidates under development 
these studies demonstrated desirable and consistent pk parameters  including relatively high bioavailability via the oral mucosa and very low gastrointestinal  or gi  bioavailability  prolonged plasma levels relative to iv delivery  pk parameters proportional to dose across a wide range of doses mcg to mcg  lower peak plasma concentration  or c 
max  than iv delivery  time to maximum plasma concentrations  or t 
max  range from to minutes  relatively low patient to patient variability in t

and c 
max  and repeat dosing pk that supports a minute minimum re dosing interval 

table of contents the chart below illustrates the pk profile of sublingual sufentanil nanotab compared to iv delivery of sufentanil from one of our completed phase pk studies 
logo we have demonstrated that sublingual delivery of sufentanil avoids the high peak plasma levels and short duration of action of iv administration  enabling potential for broader use 
our proprietary nanotab dosage form is a very small disc shaped tablet with a bioadhesive excipient  or inactive ingredient  that enables the nanotab to adhere to mucosal tissues 
this allows sublingual delivery of sufentanil from the nanotab by adherence to the sublingual mucosa  or tissues under the tongue 
the nanotab adheres within seconds after administration and full disintegration occurs within minutes 
the small size of the nanotab  pictured above  is designed to minimize the saliva response and amount of sufentanil swallowed  resulting in high oral transmucosal uptake  whereby a majority of the drug is absorbed via the oral tissues directly into the bloodstream  and consistent pharmacokinetics 
we have completed three additional definitive pk studies that will be included in the nda  as follows iap single vs 
multiple dose study iap was conducted with the sufentanil nanotab pca system and was designed to characterize the plasma concentration profile of the sufentanil nanotab after repeated dosing 
subjects self administered a single dose from the nanotab pca system and  after a washout period  consecutive doses every minutes 
plasma concentration profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters after the single and multiple dosing were compared 
iap route of delivery study iap was conducted to characterize the plasma concentration profile of the sufentanil nanotab after transmucosal sublingual and buccal and oral administration 
the absolute bioavailability of the sufentanil nanotab was also calculated 
iap drug interaction study study iap was conducted to determine whether there is a change in the sufentanil nanotab plasma concentration profile when a subject is concomitantly receiving a cypa inhibitor

the market opportunity for the nanotab system according to the decision resources acute pain report  or dr report  the post operative pain market in the united states  europe and japan is growing steadily and is expected to reach approximately billion by despite its size  this market remains underserved 
studies report that up to of patients experience inadequate pain relief after surgery 
inadequate pain relief can lead to decreased mobility  which increases the risks of other medical complications  including deep vein thrombosis and partial lung collapse  and can result in extended hospital stays 
the dr report projects that in  million in patient procedures performed in the united states and the five largest european union member state markets will require post operative treatment of pain  growing at a rate of approximately per annum 
additionally  based on an analysis of data published in from the world health organization  we estimate that there are approximately million surgical procedures annually in other moderate to high per capita healthcare expenditure nations in which patients experience moderate to severe pain 
commissioned market research targeting surgeons and anesthesiologists has identified a consistent positive response to the attributes of the nanotab system and indicates an interest in using the nanotab system in at least of their eligible patients 
additional market research indicated that physicians expressed interest in using the nanotab system for patients who stay in the hospital for less than hours and are not traditionally treated with iv pca 
pharmacy and therapeutics  or p t  committees also indicate strong interest in the nanotab system  with of the p t committee members interviewed indicating likely adoption to formulary 
how the nanotab system addresses the unmet medical need in post operative pain management there are many deficiencies associated with the current use of iv pca  including side effects associated with the most commonly used opioid  morphine  and its active metabolites  infection risk  analgesic gaps and decreased mobility associated with the invasive nature of iv delivery  and medication errors  which in some instances may be fatal  due to the complexity of iv pca pumps  many of which arise from programming errors 
according to published literature  the estimated annual error rate is errors per  people treated with iv pca in the united states 
published analysis of medmarx from to reveals that iv pca errors represent a four fold higher relative risk of harm compared to all other medication errors 
the most recent published analysis of the fda maude database reports that of iv pca operator errors reported during a two year index period  from to  resulted in patient deaths 
approximately  adverse events were reported to the fda between and  prompting class ii infusion pump recalls of devices that could cause temporary or reversible adverse effects and class i infusion pump recalls of devices that could cause serious injury or death 
these issues with infusion pumps have resulted in the issuance of new draft guidance by the fda  significantly increasing the data required to be submitted by iv pca pump manufacturers to address safety problems 

table of contents the nanotab system has the potential to address many of the key disadvantages of iv pca  including reducing the incidence of drug related side effects  eliminating the risk of iv pca related infections  reducing analgesic gaps and enhancing mobility  and eliminating the risk of programming errors 
we believe that the nanotab system will provide a favorable safety  efficacy and tolerability profile  enabling the nanotab system to become the new standard of care for pca 
further  we believe use of the nanotab system will result in increased patient satisfaction and reduced overall healthcare costs 
the nanotab system description the nanotab system allows patients to self administer sublingual sufentanil nanotabs as needed to manage their post operative pain in the hospital setting  and provides the record keeping attributes of a conventional iv pca pump while avoiding some of the key issues  such as programming errors  associated with conventional iv pca use 
our nanotab system consists of three components sufentanil  a high therapeutic index opioid  nanotabs  our proprietary  non invasive sublingual dosage form  and our novel  pre programmed  handheld pca device that enables simple patient controlled delivery of nanotabs in the hospital setting and eliminates the risk of programming errors 
the nanotab system utilizes sufentanil  which has one of the highest therapeutic indices of all commercially available opioids  making it an attractive candidate for the management of post operative pain 
formulated in our proprietary sublingual nanotab dosage form  sufentanil provides for relatively high bioavailability  with lower peak drug levels and a longer duration of action compared to iv delivery 
our nanotab system consists of the following components a disposable dispenser tip figure a  a disposable dispenser cap figure b  an adhesive thumb tag figure c  a stack of sufentanil mcg nanotabs approximately a two day supply in a disposable radio frequency identification and bar coded cartridge figure d  a reusable  rechargeable handheld controller figure e  a tether figure f  and an authorized access card figure g

we have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates 

table of contents our novel handheld pca device has the following safety features an authorized access card  which is a wireless system access key for the healthcare professional  a wireless  electronic  adhesive thumb tag that acts as a single patient identification key  pre programmed minute lock out to avoid overdosing  nanotab singulation  or dispensing  motion that eliminates runaway motor delivery risk  a security tether that is designed to prevent theft and misuse  and fully automated inventory record of nanotabs usage 
to set up the handheld pca device  the nurse or healthcare professional turns on the controller and follows the simple step by step instructions on the color graphical user interface screen described below retrieve the nanotab cartridge from secure drug storage  lock the cartridge and dispenser into the controller  and set up the secure patient access system  which is comprised of a security tether and a wireless  electronic  adhesive thumb tag that acts as a single patient identification key 
to use the nanotab system  the patient would confirm that the green indicator light is illuminated  meaning the device is available to dose  place dispenser tip under tongue and push the large button on the controller  which dispenses a single nanotab  remove the device from mouth upon hearing a tone confirming delivery of the nanotab  and see the blue indicator light illuminate  indicating no new dose can be dispensed for the next minutes 
nanotab system clinical program summary our phase program for the nanotab system consists of three phase clinical trials 
we have reported top line results from two of these three clinical trials and expect to report top line data from the final planned phase trial in the second quarter of prior to our phase program  we completed three successful phase clinical trials of sufentanil nanotabs in the post operative setting 
these phase clinical trials demonstrated analgesic efficacy  a low adverse event profile and excellent device functionality 
during our end of phase meeting with the fda  the fda stated that the demonstration of efficacy versus placebo in two phase clinical trials with a total safety database of at least patients exposed to the active drug should suffice to support a new drug application  or nda 
we have designed our phase clinical trials based on the feedback from the fda 
phase clinical trials for the nanotab system active comparator trial iap in november  we reported top line data showing that the nanotab system had met its primary endpoint of non inferiority in the phase open label active comparator trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the nanotab system mcg dose to iv pca with morphine mg dose for the treatment of moderate to severe acute post operative pain 
utilizing a randomized  open label  parallel group design  this trial enrolled adult patients at us sites for the treatment of pain immediately following open abdominal or major orthopedic surgery hip and knee replacement 
patients were randomized to treatment with the nanotab system or iv pca morphine and were treated for a minimum of hours and up to hours 

table of contents the primary endpoint for the trial was a comparison of the patient s response using the patient global assessment  or pga  of method of pain control over the hour trial period between the patients treated with the nanotab system and iv pca morphine 
the pga uses a point scale of poor  fair  good or excellent to rate each method of pain control 
the primary endpoint was determined by measuring the proportion of patients who responded good or excellent using the pga to rate their method of pain control 
an overview of the top line primary endpoint results of this phase clinical trial demonstrates that for the primary comparison  the nanotab system was non inferior p to iv pca morphine for the primary endpoint of pga comparison over the hour study period as determined by the combined percentage of patients with pga ratings of good or excellent vs 
 respectively 
a p value is a probability with a value ranging from to  which indicates the likelihood that a clinical trial is different between treatment and control groups 
p values below mean that there is a or greater chance that there is a true difference between the groups  and are typically referred to as statistically significant 
the assessment of non inferiority was based on a lower limit of for the confidence interval  or ci  around the difference between these percentages 
because the ci was to for the hour pga and therefore did not cross the zero difference line  a secondary comparison of the primary endpoint  specifically a statistical analysis of superiority could be performed 
in this trial  the nanotab system was statistically superior to iv pca morphine for the pga endpoint p 
statistically superior pga was also seen at the hour and hour timepoints 
a number of secondary endpoints were also evaluated  including comparison of individual pga ratings  a healthcare professional global assessment  or hpga  of method of pain control  drop outs from the trial due to inadequate analgesia and adverse events  and patient and nurse ease of care questionnaires using a validated questionnaire methodology specifically to evaluate patient controlled analgesia systems 
the nanotab system achieved a pga rating of excellent in of treated patients  compared to for iv pca with morphine  with a p value of 
the hpga was measured at  and hours  and produced similar results to the patient global assessment 
hpga ratings of good or excellent at hours were for the nanotab system compared to for iv pca morphine 
an assessment of non inferiority was conducted and demonstrated that the nanotab system was non inferior to iv pca morphine p in the trial 
because the ci was to for the hour hpga and therefore didn t cross the zero difference line  a statistical analysis for superiority could be performed  which demonstrated that for this trial  the nanotab system was statistically superior to iv pca morphine for the hpga endpoint at hours p 
statistically superior hpga was also seen at the hour and hour timepoints 
throughout the course of the trial  of patients treated with the nanotab system dropped out of the trial prematurely due to lack of efficacy compared to of patients treated with iv pca morphine 
additionally  of the patients treated with the nanotab system dropped out of the trial due to an adverse event compared to of the iv pca morphine patients 
we observed patients who experienced serious adverse events  or saes  in the trial  of whom three patients experienced serious adverse events assessed as possibly or probably related to the trial drug  one was related to the nanotab system and two were related to iv pca morphine 
the patient ease of care questionnaire  or patient questionnaire  asked patients to respond to questions regarding aspects of analgesia and pca systems using a zero to five rating scale  including statements such as  but not limited to  pain woke me up from my sleep  the device was easy to use  and the device interfered with my ability to get out of bed and walk around 
answers to the patient questionnaire were combined for an overall patient ease of care score 
these patient questionnaire statements were also grouped into six validated subscales  such as comfort with device  impact on movement  and knowledge and understanding 
patients were also asked in this patient questionnaire to rate their overall satisfaction with the level of pain control and with the way in which the medication was administered during the trial 

table of contents the nurse ease of care questionnaire  or nurse questionnaire  asked nurses to respond to questions regarding aspects of analgesia and pca systems using a zero to five rating scale  including statements regarding the set up and management of the systems and management of the patients 
answers to the nurse questionnaire were combined for an overall nurse ease of care score 
these nurse questionnaire statements were grouped into two validated subscales entitled time consuming and bothersome 
nurses were also asked in this nurse questionnaire to rate their overall satisfaction based on the level of pain control and with their overall satisfaction of the system 
an overview of results of the patient and nurse questionnaires results includes patients in the trial reported that they had significantly greater overall satisfaction with the nanotab system compared to iv pca morphine vs 
 respectively  out of a to scale  with a p value equal to 
patients in the trial reported that they had greater overall ease of care with the nanotab system compared to iv pca morphine vs

table of contents double blind  placebo controlled  abdominal surgery trial iap in march  we reported top line data results demonstrating that the nanotab system met its primary endpoint in a pivotal phase trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the nanotab system to placebo in the management of acute post operative pain after major open abdominal surgery 
adverse events reported in the trial were generally mild or moderate in nature and similar in both placebo and treatment groups 
utilizing a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled design  this pivotal phase trial enrolled adult patients at us sites for the treatment of acute post operative pain immediately following major abdominal surgery 
patients were treated for post operative pain for a minimum of hours  and up to hours 
patients were randomized  with patients randomized to sufentanil treatment and to placebo treatment 
both treatments were delivered by the patient  as needed  using the nanotab system with a minute lock out period 
patients in both groups could receive up to mg morphine intravenously per hour as a rescue medication  the primary purpose of this rescue medication being to provide placebo treated patients access to pain medication to enable them to stay in the trial as long as possible 
pre rescue pain scores were imputed to minimize the impact of this rescue opioid on efficacy evaluations 
the primary endpoint evaluated pain intensity over the hour study period compared to baseline  or summed pain intensity difference spid  in patients following major open abdominal surgery 
patients receiving sufentanil nanotabs demonstrated a significantly greater spid compared to placebo treated patients during the study period and  respectively  p 
a number of secondary endpoints were also evaluated  including spid at hours and hours  drop outs from the trial due to inadequate analgesia and adverse events  and patient ease of care questionnaires using a validated questionnaire methodology specifically to evaluate patient controlled analgesia systems 
a summary of the results for the secondary endpoints is as follows hours and hours after first dose  spid was significantly greater in the sufentanil treated patients than in the placebo treated patients p and p  respectively 
a summed pain relief measure over the hour study period  commonly referred to as totpar  was significantly greater for sufentanil treated patients than placebo treated patients p eighty  or  of the sufentanil nanotab treated patients completed the hour study period  compared to  or  of placebo treated patients 
reasons for drop out in the sufentanil treated and placebo treated groups were adverse events and  respectively  lack of efficacy and  respectively and other and  respectively 
treatment emergent adverse events occurred in of sufentanil treated patients and of placebo treated patients 
adverse events with an occurrence greater than in either the sufentanil group or the placebo group were nausea and  respectively  fever and  respectively  vomiting and  respectively  itching and  respectively  oxygen saturation decrease and  respectively  and hypertension and  respectively 
itching  a frequently observed side effect of opioids  was the only adverse event that was significantly different between the groups p 
all reported cases of itching in the trial were mild in nature 
only one patient  in the sufentanil group  experienced a serious adverse event  which was determined to be unrelated to the study drug by the investigator 
patients in the trial who were treated with sufentanil nanotabs reported an average overall ease of care of out of a to scale 
in addition  patients in the placebo arm of the trial also reported favorable overall ease of care scores  with an average score of 
these results are comparable to the results from the active comparator trial  which is summarized above 

table of contents the chart below illustrates the spid results from the pivotal phase  double blind  placebo controlled  abdominal surgery trial iap 
logo double blind  placebo controlled  orthopedic surgery trial iap in august  we initiated a phase clinical trial with the nanotab system in a double blind  placebo controlled trial for a minimum of hours and up to hours in patients who are undergoing a total hip or knee replacement 
the objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of the sufentanil nanotab pca system to placebo in the management of acute post operative pain after major orthopedic surgery 
up to patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with sufentanil or placebo 
the primary endpoint is the sum of pain intensity difference to baseline spid over hours 
dosing of the final subject in this trial is expected around the end of the first quarter of  and we expect to receive top line data from this trial in the second quarter of key secondary endpoints include an assessment of different imputation strategies for the use of rescue opioids  pain intensity and relief scores and patient and healthcare professional global assessments and ease of care questionnaires 
phase clinical results for arx we completed three phase clinical trials in support of sufentanil nanotabs 
across all trials  the average time interval between doses was approximately minutes 
this compares favorably to typical redosing intervals for iv pca with average period between dosing of to minutes 
no saes were reported that were considered to be related to the trial drug 
adverse events  or aes  that were reported were similar to those reported for placebo treated patients 
these results demonstrate that sufentanil nanotabs are effective and well tolerated by patients undergoing both major orthopedic and abdominal surgical procedures 

table of contents phase clinical results in unilateral knee replacement arx c in the first phase clinical trial  we conducted a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multicenter phase clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy  safety and tolerability of sublingual sufentanil nanotabs in patients undergoing elective unilateral knee replacement 
the trial enrolled male and female patients to years of age who were undergoing elective knee replacement surgery 
this procedure was chosen as it represents one of the most painful procedures patients undergo in the hospital setting 
patients were randomly assigned to treatment with sufentanil nanotab mcg  mcg  mcg  or placebo 
sufentanil nanotabs were administered by trial staff at the request of the patient with at least minutes between doses 
the primary endpoint was the sum of the pain intensity difference at each evaluation time point compared to baseline over the hour trial duration  or spid the trial results demonstrated that sufentanil nanotab mcg was effective  safe and well tolerated for the treatment of acute post operative pain in patients who had undergone unilateral knee replacement 
the sufentanil nanotab mcg spid was higher than placebo p using the last observation carried forward  or locf  imputation method 
the sufentanil nanotab mcg or mcg dosage strengths did not achieve a statistically significant separation from placebo overall 
however  the mcg dose was statistically significant as compared with placebo for women p 
throughout the trial there were statistically significant differences in spid scores between the sufentanil nanotab mcg dose group and the placebo group  even at the earliest time point of minutes p 
there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory variables  vital signs or oxygen saturation during the trial 
the five saes reported were all considered unrelated to trial drug and occurred after the end of trial drug dosing 
phase clinical results in open abdominal surgery arx c our second phase clinical trial tested sufentanil nanotabs mcg  mcg or placebo in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery 
in all other respects this trial was similar in design to our first trial 
both dosage strengths were significantly more effective than placebo for spid p as well as for all measures of pain intensity and pain relief 
significant differences between the sufentanil nanotab treatment groups and the placebo group were observed within hours after the first dose of trial drug and continued until the end of the hour treatment period 
there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory variables  vital signs or oxygen saturation during the trial 
there were no saes reported during the trial drug treatment period 
we conducted an open label functionality  safety and efficacy trial of the arx nanotab delivery system in patients undergoing elective unilateral knee replacement surgery 
the trial was a prospective  open label  multicenter trial in male and female patients to years of age with an average age of all patients were treated with sufentanil nanotab mcg dosage strength 
the primary endpoint was the percent of patients who completed the trial without any sufentanil nanotab pca system failures 
the trial also collected patient feedback on the design characteristics of the pca system 
patients self administered sufentanil nanotabs repeatedly over the hour trial using the nanotab system without any system failures or dosing errors for all patients 
over of the patients reported the two highest scores on the point likert scale of overall patient s satisfaction with the sufentanil nanotab pca system mcg

we have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates 
the market opportunity for arx according to the american cancer society  there were more than million new cancer cases in the united states in it is estimated that over  of these cases result in patients who experience breakthrough pain 
we estimate the prescription volume for oral transmucosal products for the management of cancer breakthrough pain to be  prescriptions per year 
this suggests that less than of cancer patients with cancer breakthrough pain are treated with approved transmucosal breakthrough pain medications 
in addition  many physicians use immediate release oral opioids to treat cancer breakthrough pain 
we believe that this market is significantly larger than the transmucosal product market 
market research among physicians managing cancer patients indicates that arx could capture approximately a quarter of the cancer breakthrough pain prescriptions 
in this research  arx was predicted to take share equally from both the immediate release oral products and the transmucosal products

that ranges from to minutes  and can result in erratic onset of action and the potential for dose stacking  local adverse events  such as dental caries and oral mucosal irritation  and drug packaging that lacks effective deterrence against abuse and misuse 
we designed arx to address these problems by providing sufentanil  a shorter duration of action opioid with an elimination half life ranging from to hours  which more closely matches the duration of a cancer breakthrough pain event  utilizing sufentanil  which provides for a consistent t 
max 
with a narrow range of to minutes  thereby reducing the risk of dose stacking  avoiding irritation of the oral mucosa  as demonstrated in our clinical trials  and packaging technology that enhances patient safety by reducing the possibility of misuse or abuse  while providing healthcare professionals with usage data 
in addition  continual use of any given opioid by a patient creates a risk of tolerance specific to that molecule  reducing the effectiveness of the drug 
we believe the availability of arx  as a non fentanyl based product  will allow physicians to rotate opioids prescribed for cancer breakthrough pain  thereby maintaining the effectiveness of treatment 

table of contents arx description arx is a product candidate for the treatment of cancer patients who suffer from breakthrough pain 
arx consists of a magazine containing single dose applicators  or sdas  loaded into a multiple sda dispenser  or msd 
each sda includes a sufentanil nanotab that a patient can self administer to his or her sublingual space for oral transmucosal absorption 
the msd protects and dispenses sdas  one at a time  displays a recent dose indicator that is designed to mitigate overdosing  has child resistant  elderly friendly features  and provides electronic date and time stamping of each sda removal event 
the date and time event log is designed to be retrieved from the msd by a healthcare professional during an office visit to assist the prescriber in understanding the usage profile of the medication  including diversion or abuse 
overall  our goal is to improve the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain while adding a substantially heightened level of detection and deterrence around prescription opioid use  misuse and abuse 
while the initial dispenser for outpatient use is designed for dispensing sufentanil nanotabs for cancer breakthrough pain events  we believe this concept could be adapted into developing dispensers for other scheduled drugs in the future 
sufentanil nanotab btp management system arx clinical program overview we have completed a successful phase clinical trial of arx the primary endpoint in this trial was achieved and demonstrated that the time weighted summed pain intensity difference over minutes  or spid  following treatment for sufentanil nanotab treated episodes was greater than placebo treated episodes p 
in addition  pain intensity and pain relief were included as secondary endpoints 
lower scores for pain intensity were reported at each evaluation time point for sufentanil treated episodes compared to placebo treated episodes p at minutes and p at all other time points 
time reported time weighted total pain relief  or totpar  was greater at all time points for sufentanil treated episodes compared to placebo treated episodes p and p for the and minute time points  respectively  and p for the remaining time points 
the trial also demonstrated a low adverse event profile 
we held an end of phase meeting with the fda in july the fda stated that the demonstration of efficacy versus placebo in a single phase clinical trial with a total safety database of to patients exposed to active drug  with at least patients treated for a minimum of three months  may support an indication for the treatment of cancer breakthrough pain with underlying chronic pain 
further development of the arx program is contingent on identification of corporate partnership resources 

table of contents arx sufentanil triazolam nanotab logo this product candidate has not been approved by the fda 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates 
the market opportunity for arx each year in the united states  more than million procedures take place in a physician s office that are known to be anxiety inducing and painful  according to commissioned market research data that was completed in these include diagnostic procedures such as breast and prostate biopsies  cosmetic procedures such as liposuction and dermal abrasions  interventional radiology procedures  and therapeutic procedures such as vasectomies and endometrial ablation procedures 
iv sedative medications are typically not offered to these patients because of the high cost of the specialized personnel and monitoring equipment 
despite the high potential for pain and anxiety  most patients currently undergo these procedures with only a local anesthetic  resulting in unnecessary procedure discomfort 
we believe there is significant opportunity for a fast acting  effective and safe product that can provide mild levels of sedation  anxiety reduction and analgesia for painful procedures conducted in a physician s office without the need for specialized personnel to monitor the patient 
how arx addresses the unmet medical need for painful procedures in a physician s office the joint commission on the accreditation of healthcare organizations  or jcaho  mandates that iv sedation requires specialized monitoring  resuscitative equipment and appropriately trained staff 
as a result  many practitioners do not provide any iv sedation to their patients prior to or during painful procedures that take place in a physician s office  and instead rely only on the analgesic benefit of local anesthetics 
the anxiety and pain that an individual experiences during painful procedures in a physician s office without sedation has been studied and reported in peer reviewed journals 
ninety six percent of men report moderate pain immediately after prostate biopsy  with only of patients reporting no pain during the biopsy 
similarly  women undergoing breast biopsies have pre procedural scores averaging to out of for visual analog scale measurements of nervousness  tension and fearfulness 
this data highlights the need for a mild sedative with analgesic and anxiety reducing properties in addition to a local anesthetic for painful procedures in a physician s office 
we believe that arx can provide physicians with a non invasive  rapid acting product for mild sedation  anxiety reduction and pain relief during painful diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a physician s office 
we believe the availability of arx may increase the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed in a physician s office  resulting in cost savings because specialized personnel and equipment would not be necessary 
arx description arx sufentanil triazolam nanotab is a single  fixed dose sublingual product candidate designed to be administered by a healthcare professional prior to a painful procedure in a physician s office 
an important advantage of sufentanil and triazolam over other drugs in their classes is their rapid uptake from the sublingual mucosa 
our phase clinical data showed that administering arx via sublingual route prior to a procedure results in a rapid onset of mild sedation and reduction in anxiety in to minutes 
sufentanil and triazolam 
table of contents have short half lives compared to many other agents in the same class of compounds  enabling patients treated with arx to be discharged immediately following completion of the procedure 
the sublingual route of administration avoids the high plasma concentrations associated with iv delivery  thereby obviating the need for specialized personnel and extensive monitoring 
sufentanil triazolam nanotab arx clinical program overview we have completed a successful phase clinical trial of arx demonstrating rapid onset of mild sedation and anxiety reduction  with a low adverse event profile during an abdominal liposuction procedure 
in addition  we participated in an end of phase meeting with the fda in may to discuss the phase clinical program and requirements for an nda submission 
based on these discussions  two four arm factorial phase clinical trials will be required with a minimum of patients exposed to active drug 
further development of the arx program is contingent on identification of corporate partnership resources 
arx sufentanil single dose nanotab logo this product candidate has not been approved by the fda 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates 
the market opportunity for arx we believe that arx could be useful in a variety of medically supervised settings  including for battlefield casualty treatment  by paramedics during patient transport  in the emergency room  or for post operative patients  following either short stay or ambulatory surgery  who do not require more long term patient controlled analgesia 
according to the centers for disease control and prevention  or cdc  there were more than million emergency room visits in  of which it is estimated that more than million were injury related emergency room visits  and analgesics were provided or prescribed during more than million of these visits 
how arx addresses the unmet medical need for moderate to severe acute pain arx is a non invasive  fast onset sufentanil product candidate for treatment of patients with moderate to severe acute pain  either on the battlefield or in civilian settings of trauma or injury 
on the battlefield  in the emergency room and in ambulatory care environments  patients often do not have immediate iv access available 
intramuscular injections are a current standard of care on the battlefield  but they are invasive  painful and present an increased risk of infection to both patient and healthcare professional 
in addition  in cases of severe trauma where the patient is often in hypovolemic shock and muscles are not well perfused  pain medication given by intramuscular injection may not readily reach the bloodstream to provide pain relief  rendering this route of delivery suboptimal 
oral pills and liquids generally have slow and erratic onset of analgesia 
even patients with iv access may have undesirable side effects with the commonly used iv opioids morphine and hydromorphone  such as sedation or oxygen desaturation 
moreover  iv dosing results in high peak plasma levels  thereby limiting the opioid dose and requiring frequent redosing intervals to titrate to satisfactory analgesia 
additional treatment options are needed that can safely and rapidly treat acute trauma pain  in both civilian and military settings 

table of contents arx description arx is a non invasive  fast onset sufentanil product candidate for treatment of patients with moderate to severe acute pain  either on the battlefield or in civilian settings of trauma or injury 
arx features sufentanil  a high therapeutic index opioid  in our proprietary nanotab technology that enables rapid sublingual absorption when the nanotab is placed under the tongue 
as a result  sufentanil nanotabs can provide rapid onset of analgesia and display a consistent pharmacokinetic profile due to a high percentage of drug being absorbed sublingually instead of through the gastrointestinal tract 
in addition to battlefield casualty treatment  if approved  we anticipate that arx could be useful in a variety of medically supervised settings  including by paramedics during patient transport  in the emergency room  for non surgical patients experiencing pain in the hospital  or for post operative patients  following either short stay or ambulatory surgery  who do not require more long term patient controlled analgesia 
sufentanil single dose nanotab arx clinical program summary in may  we received a grant from the us army medical research and materiel command  or usamrmc  to conduct a phase dose finding trial  and to prepare to enter phase in the phase clinical trial of arx  two different doses of sufentanil are being evaluated in patients suffering from moderate to severe acute pain  with the goal of determining an appropriate dose to take into phase in november  we initiated the phase clinical trial and  in february  dosing of the last patient in this trial was completed 
this phase clinical trial enrolled patients and top line results from the trial are expected during the second quarter of phase clinical trial for arx in november  we initiated our arx phase dose finding trial  a prospective  randomized  double blind multicenter trial in patients to years of age that are undergoing primary  unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery alone or with ipsilateral hammertoe repair 
patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria following surgery were randomly assigned to treatment with sufentanil nanotab mcg  sufentanil nanotab mcg  or placebo 
randomization was stratified within each site by two age groups years and in the trial  patients patients in sufentanil nanotab mcg group  patients in sufentanil nanotab mcg group and patients in placebo treatment group received trial drug and provided primary efficacy data for analysis 
efficacy was assessed as follows patient reports of pain intensity on an nrs  pain relief on a point pain relief scale  percentage of patients requiring rescue analgesics due to inadequate analgesia  and patient global assessment of effectiveness and tolerability 
also  a double stop watch technique was used to assess onset of perceived and meaningful analgesia after the first dose of trial drug 
the primary endpoint is the spid secondary endpoints include totpar over the hour trial period  proportion of patients requiring rescue analgesics due to inadequate analgesia over the hour trial period  proportion of patients who responded in each category of the patient global assessment  time to onset of perceived and meaningful analgesia and time to first use of rescue analgesics and total number of doses of rescue analgesic used 
other potential applications for our nanotab technology we believe that as a platform technology  the nanotab  either as a standalone dosage form or in conjunction with various forms of dispensing mechanisms  has the potential to enable other product candidates utilizing a number of additional compounds to be delivered sublingually to the oral mucosa 
there are numerous compounds used for the treatment of pain as well as other therapeutic indications which are dosed in microgram quantities and possess characteristics that we believe make them potential candidates for sublingual delivery via the nanotab 

table of contents our strategy our strategy is to develop and commercialize a portfolio of sufentanil nanotab based products and other products in hospital markets in the united states 
we have designed and are developing product candidates that have clearly defined clinical development programs  target large commercial market opportunities  and require modestly sized commercial organizations in the united states 
we selectively utilize third party contractors in order to maximize the capital efficiency of our development and commercialization efforts 
in addition  we plan to enter into partnerships to market our product candidates outside the united states 
our lead product candidate  the nanotab system  is currently in phase development  which consists of three phase clinical trials 
we have completed and reported positive top line results for two of the trials and expect to report data from the third trial in the second quarter of contingent upon receipt of successful data from the final planned nanotab system phase clinical trial  we intend to submit an nda to the fda in the third quarter of if our planned nda is approved  we plan to commercialize the nanotab system ourselves in the united states  and commercialize it outside the united states with a partner 
our specific strategy with respect to the nanotab system is to complete the remaining phase efficacy trial and seek regulatory approval in the united states and other countries  strengthen our commercial relationships for the manufacturing of the components and assembly of the nanotab system  build a targeted hospital directed sales force in the united states  and partner with third parties for commercialization outside of the united states 
further development of arx and arx will likely depend on the identification of a partner to support these efforts 
development of arx beyond the current grant supported activities is contingent upon the successful results from our phase clinical trial and identification of additional funding 
sales and marketing we anticipate developing a distribution capability and commercial organization in the united states to market and sell our product candidates alone or with partners  while out licensing commercialization rights outside of the united states 
in executing our strategy  our goal is to have significant control over the development process and commercial execution for our product candidates  while retaining meaningful economics 
we plan to progressively build commercial capability to support introduction of the nanotab system to the united states market as we move toward potential nda submission and approval 
we foresee two stages of commercial execution to support successful introduction of the nanotab system in the united states in parallel with advancement and completion of our phase clinical trial program and the planned submission of an nda for the nanotab system  we plan to highlight the clinical and health economic data identifying the limitations of iv pca in use today  increase awareness of the clinical profile of the nanotab system through publication of our clinical data  create and deploy a focused scientific support team to gather a detailed understanding of individual hospital needs in order to be prepared to present the nanotab system effectively at the time of commercial launch  establish advisory boards with anesthesiologists  surgeons  nurses and p t committees to provide us with input on appropriate commercial positioning for the nanotab system for each of these key audiences  
table of contents build a marketing organization that can define appropriate segmentation and positioning strategies and tactics for the nanotab system  and design a post approval clinical development program 
assuming fda approval  we plan to establish the nanotab system on hospital formularies through deployment of an experienced team to explain the clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefits of the nanotab system in comparison to iv pca  create and progressively deploy a high quality  customer focused and experienced sales organization dedicated to bringing innovative  highly valued healthcare solutions to patients  payors and healthcare providers  including progressively building a targeted hospital directed sales force of approximately people in the united states  conduct a post approval clinical program for the nanotab system  establish the nanotab system as the product of choice for traditional post operative pca  and expand the market through deployment of the nanotab system for hour stay patients  and other in hospital acute pain conditions

competition our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies  and medical technology companies 
we believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are the safety  efficacy and tolerability profile  the patient and healthcare professional satisfaction with using our product candidates in relation to available alternatives and the reliability  convenience of dosing  price and reimbursement of our product candidates 
many of our potential competitors  including many of the organizations named below  have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products 
accordingly  our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining fda approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance 
our competitors drugs may be more effective  or may be more effectively marketed and sold  than any drug we may commercialize  which may render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive before we can recover our losses 
we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available 
potential competition for the nanotab system we are developing the nanotab system for the management of moderate to severe acute post operative pain in adult patients during hospitalization 
we believe that the nanotab system would compete with a number of opioid based treatment options that are currently available 
the market for opioids for post operative pain is large and competitive 
the primary competition for the nanotab system is the iv pca pump  which is widely used in the post operative setting 
leading manufacturers of iv pca pumps include hospira inc  carefusion corporation  baxter international inc  curlin medical  inc 
and smiths medical 
the most common opioids used to treat post operative pain are morphine  hydromorphone and fentanyl  all of which are available as generics 
also available on the market is the avancen medication on demand  or mod  oral pca device developed by avancen mod corporation 
additional potential competitors for the nanotab system include products in 
table of contents development  including the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system  ionsys  originally developed by alza corporation and ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  both johnson johnson subsidiaries  and currently under development by incline therapeutics  inc  which was acquired by the medicines company 
also in development is moxduo  an orally administered  fixed ratio combination of morphine and oxycodone being developed by qrx pharma  an australian company 
this drug is also in development as an iv product 
potential competition for arx we are developing arx  the sufentanil nanotab btp management system  for the treatment of breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant patients  with an initial indication in cancer patients 
the market for opioids for treatment of cancer breakthrough pain is large and competitive  however  currently there are no sufentanil products approved by the fda for this indication 
our potential competitors for arx include products approved in the united states for cancer breakthrough pain  including actiq and fentora  currently manufactured by teva pharmaceuticals  onsolis  currently manufactured by biodelivery sciences international  inc  abstral  currently manufactured by prostrakan group plc  lazanda  currently manufactured by archimedes pharma limited  as well as products approved in europe  including instanyl  currently manufactured by nycomed international management gmbh 
the active ingredient in all approved products for cancer breakthrough pain is fentanyl 
additional potential competitors for arx include products in late stage development for cancer breakthrough pain  such as fentanyl taifun  currently manufactured by akela pharma  inc  and sl spray  currently manufactured by insys therapeutics  inc potential competition for arx we are developing arx  the sufentanil triazolam nanotab  for use in diagnostic or therapeutic painful procedures of short duration in a physician s office 
for these procedures  many practitioners rely primarily on local anesthetics injected to the procedural area to reduce the pain of the procedure  and do not use iv sedatives to manage the anxiety of patients because of the cost of having additional trained staff to monitor the patients 
currently  we are not aware of any products on the market which combine an opioid with a benzodiazepine in a single dosage form to manage the anxiety and pain of procedures in a physician s office 
we are not aware of any approved or development stage non iv sedative analgesic products that would present competition to arx in the future  there may be products developed or approved for this market which could directly compete with arx potential competition for arx competitors for arx within the military environment include intramuscular morphine injections which are marketed by a variety of generic manufacturers 
within the civilian environment  there are a wide variety of approved injectable and oral opioid products to treat moderate to severe acute pain  including iv opioids such as morphine  fentanyl  hydromorphone and meperidine or oral opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone 
pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply we currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufentanil and sufentanil triazolam nanotabs for our clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  with oversight by our internal managers 
equipment specific to the pharmaceutical manufacturing process was purchased and customized by us and is currently owned by us 
we plan to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and  potentially  collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the fda 
we currently rely on a single manufacturer for the preclinical and clinical supplies of our drug product for each of our product candidates and do not currently have agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for any of our product candidates

our product candidates must be approved by the fda through the nda process before they may legally be marketed in the united states 
in the united states  the fda regulates drugs under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  or fdca  and regulations 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and complying with applicable laws and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources 
failure to comply at any time during the product development and approval process  or after approval  may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions 
these sanctions could include the fda s refusal to approve pending applications  withdrawal of an approval  a clinical hold  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of 
table of contents production or distribution  injunctions  fines  refusals of government contracts  restitution  disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties 
the process required by the fda before a drug product may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following completion of non clinical laboratory tests  animal trials and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices regulations  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug  or ind  application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practices  or gcp  to establish the clinical safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for its intended use  submission to the fda of an nda for a new drug product  satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product and the drug substance s are produced to assess compliance with cgmp  payment of user and facility fees  and fda review and approval of the nda 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined phase the product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
in the case of some products for severe or life threatening diseases  especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers  the initial human testing is often conducted in patients 
phase involves trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted conditions and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule 
phase clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage  clinical safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites 
these trials are intended to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling 
progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the fda and safety reports must be submitted to the fda and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events 
the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
similarly  an institutional review board  or irb  can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the irb s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients 
concurrent with clinical trials  companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cgmp and qsr for medical devices requirements 
the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and  among other things  the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity  strength  quality and purity of the final product 
additionally  appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life 

table of contents our product candidates  the nanotab system  arx  arx and arx  are regulated under ind applications for clinical development and in the case of the nanotab system  all device related information is filed under the chemistry  manufacturing and controls section  or cmc  of an ind 
the results of product development  preclinical trials and clinical trials  along with descriptions of the manufacturing process  analytical tests conducted on our drug products  proposed labeling and other relevant information  will be submitted to the fda as part of an nda for a new drug product  requesting approval to market the product in the united states 
the submission of an nda is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee  a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances 
in addition  under the pediatric research equity act  an nda or supplement to an nda must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective 
the fda may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers 
the approval process is lengthy and difficult and the fda may refuse to approve an nda if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information 
even if such data and information is submitted  the fda may ultimately decide that the nda does not satisfy the criteria for approval 
data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data 
if one or more of our product candidates receive regulatory approval  the approval may be limited to specific conditions and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited  which could restrict the commercial value of the product 
our product candidates  if approved  will also require risk evaluations and mitigation strategies  or rems  that can include a medication guide  patient package insert  a communication plan  elements to assure safe use and implementation system  and must include a timetable for assessment of the rems 
further  the fda may require that certain contraindications  warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized 
in addition  the fda may require post approval testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug product s safety and effectiveness after the nda 
post approval requirements any drug products for which we receive fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including  among other things  record keeping requirements  reporting of adverse experiences with the product  providing the fda with updated clinical safety and efficacy information  product sampling and distribution requirements  complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with fda promotion and advertising requirements 
the fda strictly regulates labeling  advertising  promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market 
drug products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label 
further  manufacturers of drug products must continue to comply with cgmp requirements  which are extensive and require considerable time  resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance 
in addition  changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior fda approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims  are also subject to further fda review and approval 
drug product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drug products are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with cgmp and other laws 
the cgmp requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process  including the production  processing  packaging  labeling  storage and shipment of the drug product 
manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards  and test each product batch or lot prior to its release 
in the case of the nanotab system  the device component must comply with cfr 
table of contents we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products 
future fda and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct 
the fda may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
further  the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions  such as fines  warning letters  holds on clinical trials  product recalls or seizures  product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products  refusal to approve pending applications or supplements  restrictions on marketing or manufacturing  injunctions or civil or criminal penalties 
foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the united states  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the united states 
in october  we received notice from the european medicines agency  or ema  that the nanotab system was eligible for centralized marketing authorization application in the european union 
this regulatory procedure  reserved for novel products  biotechnology products and new chemical entities  allows for commercialization across european union and efta countries based on approval by ema 
in addition  conformance to the european medical device directive could require ce marking on the nanotab system device to enable commercialization in the european union 
outside of europe  the requirements and approval process vary from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
controlled substances regulations sufentanil  a schedule ii controlled substance  is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the nanotab system  arx  arx and arx triazolam  a schedule iv controlled substance  is also an active pharmaceutical ingredient in arx controlled substances are governed by the drug enforcement administration  or dea  of the us department of justice 
the handling of controlled substances and or drug product by us  our contract manufacturers  analytical laboratories  packagers and distributors  are regulated by the controlled substances act and title cfr  part unforeseen delays to the drug substance and drug product manufacture and supply chain may occur due to delays  errors or other unforeseen problems with the permitting process 
also  any one of our suppliers  contract manufacturers  laboratories  packagers and or distributors could be the subject of dea violations and enforcement could lead to delays or even loss of dea license by the contractors 
health law compliance in addition to fda laws and regulations  we must comply with a variety of federal and state laws governing  among other things  the privacy of healthcare information  our relationships with healthcare providers and the reimbursement of prescription drug products 
although the federal health care program anti kickback statute has a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing  purchases  or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed 
table of contents under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payer 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors  it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws 
such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in march  the patient protection and affordable health care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  or collectively the ppaca  was enacted  which includes measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers 
many of the details regarding the implementation of the ppaca are yet to be determined  and at this time  it remains unclear the full effect that the ppaca would have on our business 
research and development conducting research and development is central to our business model 
we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that quarterly research and development expenses during the first half of will be in line with or modestly higher than the fourth quarter of as we conduct and complete the phase clinical trials for the nanotab system and the arx phase clinical trial 
however  we plan to incur significant expenditures for the foreseeable future as we seek to continue commercial preparations for the nanotab system and development of arx  and subsequently advance the development of arx and arx contingent upon additional funding or identification of corporate partnership resources 
employees as of december   we employed full time employees  all of whom are located at our headquarters in redwood city  california 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 

table of contents item a 
risk factors this form k contains forward looking information based on our current expectations 
because our actual results may differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us  this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our actual future results  including  but not limited to  our revenues  expenses  net loss and loss per share 
we believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us as of the date of this form k 
if any of the following risks comes to fruition  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our financial condition and need for additional capital we have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
we are a development stage company with limited operating history 
to date  we have focused primarily on developing our lead product candidate  the sufentanil nanotab pca system  or the nanotab system or arx we have three additional product candidates  the sufentanil nanotab btp management system  or arx  the sufentanil triazolam nanotab  or arx  and sufentanil single dose acute pain nanotab  or arx we have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception in july and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development  including our non clinical development activities and clinical trials 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt 
the size of our future net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenues 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses as we prepare for the potential commercialization of the nanotab system and continue our research and development activities for our product candidates 
to date  none of our product candidates have been commercialized  and if our product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized  or if revenues are insufficient following marketing approval  we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail 
even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates in the united states  our revenues are also dependent upon the size of the markets outside of the united states  as well as our ability to obtain market approval and achieve commercial success 
as a result of the foregoing  we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we have never generated any product or commercial revenue and may never be profitable 
our ability to generate revenue from commercial sales and achieve profitability depends on our ability  alone or with collaborators  to successfully complete the development of  obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for  and commercialize our product candidates 
other than the revenue received from the us army medical research and materiel command  or usamrmc  for research and development reimbursement under the terms of the grant for arx we received from the usamrmc  we do not anticipate generating revenues from sales of our product candidates for the foreseeable future  if ever 
our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in completing the clinical development of the nanotab system  initially for the treatment of post operative pain in the hospital setting  obtaining regulatory approval for the nanotab system  which will require additional funding  launching and commercializing the nanotab system  including building a hospital directed sales force in the us and collaborating with third parties internationally  which will require additional funding  and completing the clinical development of  obtaining regulatory approval for  and launching and commercializing arx  arx and arx  which will require additional funding or corporate partnership resources 

table of contents because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development  we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses  or when  or if  we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
in addition  our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to perform trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate 
even if one or more of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale  we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate 
even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products  we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations 
we have a limited operating history that may make it difficult to predict our future performance or evaluate our business and prospects 
we were incorporated in since inception  our operations have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing our company  developing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates 
we have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
consequently  any predictions you make about our future success or viability or evaluation of our business and prospects may not be accurate 
we will require substantial additional capital and may be unable to raise capital  which would force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development programs and could cause us to cease operations 
developing pharmaceutical products  including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  is expensive 
we expect to incur significant expenditures in connection with our ongoing activities  particularly the completion of our phase clinical trials  preparation for potential commercialization of the nanotab system and future advancement of other product candidates 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investment balances will be sufficient to fund our current operations into the third quarter of we may be able to extend this time period to the extent that we can access additional capital through equity offerings  including our sales agreement with mlv 
however  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to support our future operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
additionally  changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate 
for example  we believe that our existing cash resources  based on our current estimates of clinical trial expenditures and enrollment pace  are adequate to complete our ongoing nanotab system phase clinical trials  to submit our planned new drug application  or nda  to the fda for the nanotab system  and to begin preparation for commercialization and manufacturing of the nanotab system in the united states 
however  our clinical trials may encounter technical  enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs more than we expected 
even if we are able to submit an nda  the fda could require us to complete further studies  which would require additional capital before we receive our regulatory approval  if at all 
in any event  we will require substantial additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for  and to commercialize  our product candidates  including the nanotab system 
raising funds in the current economic environment  when the capital markets have been affected by the global recession  may present additional challenges 
to raise capital  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain a credit facility or enter into product development  license or distribution agreements with third parties or divest one or more of our product candidates 
any product development  licensing  distribution or sale agreements that we enter into may require us to relinquish valuable rights 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding or enter into a strategic transaction in a timely manner 
securing additional financing may divert our management from our day to day activities  which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms  we may be required to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates  
table of contents seek corporate partners for the nanotab system on terms that might be less favorable than might otherwise be available  or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms  our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  we will not be able to continue our planned level of operations beyond the third quarter of and will not have sufficient capital to complete the regulatory approval process for the nanotab system in the united states  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and prospects 
if adequate funds are not available  we would be required to reduce our workforce  delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs in advance of the date on which we exhaust our cash resources to ensure that we have sufficient capital to meet our obligations and continue on a path designed to preserve stockholder value 
we may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations  which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business 
in order to raise additional funds to support our operations  we may sell additional equity or debt securities  including under our sales agreement with mlv  which would result in dilution to all of our stockholders or impose restrictive covenants that adversely impact our business 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and dilution to all of our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants  such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt  limitations on our ability to acquire  sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 
if we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations 
we might be unable to service our existing debt due to a lack of cash flow and might be subject to default 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement with hercules technology ii  lp and hercules technology growth capital  inc  collectively referred to as hercules  under which we borrowed million in two tranches of million each  represented by secured convertible term promissory notes 
the interest rate is  with the initial months of the facility requiring interest only payments 
the notes issued pursuant to the loan and security agreement mature on december  since entering into the agreement with hercules  we have been making monthly interest only payments to hercules of approximately  per month until june  according to the terms of the hercules agreement  beginning on july   we began repaying hercules principal  with equal monthly payments of  consisting of both principal and interest payments until the maturity date of the loan in december  as of december   the outstanding principal owed to hercules was million 
we granted hercules a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets  with the exception of our intellectual property  where the security interest is limited to proceeds of intellectual property 
if we do not make the required payments when due  either at maturity  or at applicable installment payment dates  or if we breach the agreement or become insolvent  hercules could elect to declare all amounts outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and penalty  to be immediately due and payable 
in order to continue our planned operations and satisfy our debt obligations with hercules  we will need to raise additional capital in the future 
additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
even if we were able to repay the full amount in cash  any such repayment could leave us with little or no working capital for our business 
if we are unable to repay those amounts  hercules will have a first claim on our assets pledged under the loan agreement 
if hercules should attempt to foreclose on the collateral  it is unlikely that there would be any assets remaining after repayment in full of such secured indebtedness 
any default under the loan agreement and resulting foreclosure would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to continue our operations 

table of contents risks related to clinical development and regulatory approval we depend substantially on the success of our nanotab system  which is still under clinical development  and may not obtain regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized 
we have not marketed  distributed or sold any products 
the success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize the nanotab system for the treatment of acute post operative pain 
we recently completed two of three planned phase nanotab system clinical trials  with one phase nanotab system clinical trial ongoing 
contingent upon receipt of successful data from the remaining phase clinical trial  we intend to submit an nda for the nanotab system to the fda in the third quarter of there is no guarantee that the remaining phase nanotab system clinical trial or the human factors studies to be included in the planned nda  will be completed on schedule or if at all  or if completed  will be successful 
even if we are able to submit an nda  the fda could require us to complete further studies  which could delay or preclude any approval of the nda and would require us to obtain significant additional funding 
any delay in obtaining  or inability to obtain  regulatory approval would prevent us from commercializing the nanotab system  generating revenues and achieving profitability 
if any of these events occur  we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for the nanotab system  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations 
we depend substantially on the successful completion of phase clinical trials for our product candidates 
the positive clinical results obtained to date for our product candidates may not be repeated in the future 
in march  we announced positive top line data from our double blind  placebo controlled  phase trial for the nanotab system in patients following abdominal surgery 
in addition  in november  we announced positive top line data from our active comparator nanotab system phase clinical trial 
subsequent analyses of clinical trial data may lead to different  including less favorable  interpretations of the results than the analyses conducted to date or may identify important implications of the trial that are not currently known  or be subject to differing interpretations by the regulatory agencies 
in addition  we are still awaiting conclusion and results of our one remaining nanotab system phase clinical trial  which are expected to be released during the second quarter of there is no guarantee that the results of the remaining phase clinical trial will be positive  and the positive results to date from our phase clinical trials are not an indication or guarantee that the remaining phase clinical trial results will be positive 
our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical and medical device development 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate  we must successfully complete all required phase clinical trials 
negative or inconclusive results of a phase clinical trial could cause the fda to require that we repeat it or conduct additional clinical trials 
even if we believe that the data from required phase clinical trials is positive  the fda could analyze our data using alternative imputation strategies and determine that any trial was negative or inconclusive 
furthermore  while we have completed multiple phase clinical trials for the nanotab system  arx and arx and have obtained positive safety and efficacy results for our sufentanil based product candidates during our prior clinical trials  we cannot be certain that these results will be duplicated when our product candidates are tested in a larger number of patients in our phase clinical trials  including in our ongoing phase clinical trial of the nanotab system 
delays in clinical trials are common and have many causes  and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales 
we have experienced and may in the future experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates 
we are conducting three phase clinical trials for the nanotab system  and recently announced top line results from two of these phase clinical trials 
the remaining phase clinical trial is currently underway 
in november 
table of contents  we initiated a phase clinical trial for arx and expect data in the second quarter of our current and planned clinical trials may not begin on time  have an effective design  enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule  if at all 
our clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons  including inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial  delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial  delays in reaching agreement with the fda on final trial design  imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the fda or other regulatory authorities  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations  or cros  and clinical trial sites  delays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site  delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial  delays in the testing  validation  manufacturing and delivery of the device components of our product candidates  delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post treatment follow up  clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment or being delayed in entering data to allow for clinical trial database closure  time required to add new clinical sites  or delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials 
if our clinical trials  including our ongoing phase clinical trial for the nanotab system or phase clinical trial for arx  are delayed for any of the above reasons  our development costs may increase  our approval process could be delayed and our ability to commercialize and commence sales of our product candidates could be materially harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance 
adverse events  or aes  caused by our product candidates could cause us  other reviewing entities  clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval 
in our phase active comparator nanotab system clinical trial  of nanotab system treated patients dropped out of the trial prematurely due to an adverse event  and we observed one serious adverse event  or sae  that was assessed as possibly or probably related to the nanotab system 
in our phase  double blind  placebo controlled  abdominal surgery trial  adverse events reported in the trial were generally mild or moderate in nature and similar in both placebo and treatment groups 
in addition  one patient in the trial  who was in the sufentanil group  experienced a serious adverse event  which was determined to be unrelated to the study drug 
phase clinical trials conducted by us with our nanotab system  arx and arx product candidates have generated some aes  but no saes  related to the trial drug 
the analysis of the full data set from our active comparator and abdominal nanotab system phase clinical trials or the analysis of the data set from our remaining phase nanotab system trial  when available  could result in identification of additional aes or saes  related to the trial drug 
additional saes related to the trial drug observed in any of our clinical trials  including in our ongoing phase clinical trial  may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates 

table of contents further  if our products cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval  a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result  including regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements  such as warnings or contraindications  we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials  we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients  or our reputation may suffer 
any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates 
additional time may be required to obtain regulatory approval for our nanotab system product candidate because it is a drug device combination 
the nanotab system is a drug device combination product candidate with both drug and device components submitted in the investigational new drug  or ind  application 
based on our discussions with the fda  we believe that the nanotab system is viewed as a combination product by the fda  and both drug and device components will be required for review as part of an nda submission 
there are very few examples of the fda approval process for drug device combination products such as the nanotab system 
as a result  we have in the past and may in the future experience delays for the nanotab system due to regulatory uncertainties in the product development and approval process  in particular as it relates to a drug device combination product approval under an nda 
after the completion of our clinical trials  we cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any of our product candidates  and we cannot  therefore  predict the timing of any future revenue 
we cannot commercialize any of our product candidates  including the nanotab system  until the appropriate regulatory authorities  such as the fda or the european medicines agency  or ema  have reviewed and approved the product candidate 
the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner  or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the nanotab system 
additional delays may result if the nanotab system is taken before an fda advisory committee which may recommend restrictions on approval or recommend non approval 
in addition  we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action  or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and the review process 
the process for obtaining approval of an nda is time consuming  subject to unanticipated delays and costs  and requires the commitment of substantial resources 
if the fda determines that the clinical trials submitted for a product candidate in support of an nda were not conducted in full compliance with the applicable protocols for these trials  as well as with applicable regulations and standards  or if the fda does not agree with our interpretation of the results of such trials  the fda may reject the data that resulted from such trials 
the rejection of data from clinical trials required to support an nda could negatively impact our ability to obtain marketing authorization for a product candidate and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  an nda may not be approved  or approval may be delayed  as a result of changes in fda policies for drug approval during the review period 
for example  although many products have been approved by the fda in recent years under section b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or fdca  objections 
table of contents have been raised to the fda s interpretation of section b 
if challenges to the fda s interpretation of section b are successful  the fda may be required to change its interpretation  which could delay or prevent the approval of such an nda 
any significant delay in the review or approval of an nda that we submit would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates even if they meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials 
the fda and other foreign regulatory agencies  such as the ema  can delay  limit or deny marketing approval for many reasons  including a product candidate may not be considered safe or effective  the manufacturing processes or facilities we have selected may not meet the applicable requirements  and changes in their approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional work on our part 
part of the regulatory approval process includes compliance inspections of manufacturing facilities to ensure adherence to applicable regulations and guidelines 
the regulatory agency may delay  limit or deny marketing approval of our product candidates as a result of such inspections 
any delay in  or failure to receive or maintain  approval for any of our product candidates could prevent us from generating meaningful revenues or achieving profitability 
our product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their endpoints in clinical trials 
regulatory agencies  including the fda  or their advisors may disagree with our trial design and our interpretations of data from preclinical trials and clinical trials 
regulatory agencies may change requirements for approval even after a clinical trial design has been approved 
the fda exercises significant discretion over the regulation of combination products  including the discretion to require separate marketing applications for the drug and device components in a combination product 
to date  our product candidates are being regulated as drug products under the nda process administered by the fda 
the fda could in the future require additional regulation of our product candidates under the medical device provisions of the fdca 
our systems are designed to comply with quality systems regulation  or qsr  which sets forth the fda s current good manufacturing practice  or gmp  requirements for medical devices  and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards for drug gmps 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
regulatory agencies also may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post marketing trials 
in addition  regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for the nanotab system and our other product candidates  we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties 
even if we obtain regulatory approval in the united states  the fda may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates  or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post approval trials or post market surveillance 
for example  the labeling ultimately approved for the nanotab system and our other product candidates will likely include restrictions on use due to the opioid nature of sufentanil 
the nanotab system and our other product candidates will also be subject to ongoing fda requirements governing the labeling  packaging  storage  distribution  safety surveillance  advertising  promotion  
table of contents record keeping and reporting of safety and other post market information 
the holder of an approved nda is obligated to monitor and report aes and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the nda 
the holder of an approved nda must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product  product labeling or manufacturing process 
advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda rules and are subject to fda review  in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws 
in addition  manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  and adherence to commitments made in the nda 
if we  or a regulatory agency  discover previously unknown problems with a product  such as aes of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured  a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility  including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of our product candidate  a regulatory agency may issue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law  seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines  suspend or withdraw regulatory approval  suspend any ongoing clinical trials  refuse to approve a pending nda or supplements to an nda submitted by us  seize product  or refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts  including government contracts 
any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity 
the occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenues 
even if we obtain fda approval for the nanotab system or any of our product candidates in the united states  we may never obtain approval for or commercialize our products outside of the united states  which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential 
in order to market any products outside of the united states  we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy 
in october  we received notice from the ema that the nanotab system was eligible for centralized european review 
outside of europe  clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries  and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country 
approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods 
seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non clinical trials or clinical trials  which could be costly and time consuming 
regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries 
we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction  including international markets  and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets 
if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals  or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed  our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed 

table of contents the nanotab system and our other product candidates will require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  or rems 
the fda amendments act of implemented safety related changes to product labeling and require the adoption of rems 
our product candidates will require rems 
the rems may include requirements for special labeling or medication guides for patients  special communication plans to health care professionals and restrictions on distribution and use 
while we have received information from the fda regarding certain aspects of the required rems for the nanotab system  we cannot predict the specific rems to be required as part of the fda s approval of the nanotab system 
depending on the extent of the rems requirements  our costs to commercialize the nanotab system may be substantial 
arx  arx and arx  if approved  will also require rems programs that may significantly increase our costs to commercialize these product candidates 
furthermore  risks of sufentanil that are not adequately addressed through proposed rems for our product candidates may also prevent or delay their approval for commercialization 
risks related to our reliance on third parties we rely on third party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies  and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails many risks including the inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently  a delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity  manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale up of manufacturing  costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale up  a failure to comply with cgmp and similar foreign standards  the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms  termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us  the reliance on a limited number of sources  and in some cases  single sources for product components  such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components  we will be unable to manufacture and sell our product candidates in a timely fashion  in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms  the lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier  operations of our third party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations  including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier  carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control  and the failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner 
any of these events could lead to clinical trial delays  failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products 
some of these events could be the basis for fda action  including injunction  recall  seizure  or total or partial suspension of production 
we rely on limited sources of supply for the drug component of our product candidates and any disruption in the chain of supply may cause delay in developing and commercializing our product candidates 
currently  we use two established suppliers of sufentanil citrate for our nanotabs 
for each product candidate  only one of the two suppliers will be qualified as a vendor with the fda 
if supply from the approved vendor is 
table of contents interrupted  there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply 
the alternative vendor would need to be qualified through an nda supplement which could result in further delay 
the fda or other regulatory agencies outside of the united states may also require additional trials if a new sufentanil supplier is relied upon for commercial production 
in addition  the drug enforcement administration  or the dea  may reduce  delay or refuse our quota for sufentanil  which would disrupt our supply of sufentanil citrate and cause delay in the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
currently  we use one supplier of triazolam for our arx nanotabs 
switching triazolam suppliers may involve substantial cost and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines 
these factors could cause the delay of clinical trials  regulatory submissions  required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates  cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing them successfully 
furthermore  if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices  and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost  our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue 
manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs requires specialized equipment and expertise 
ethanol  which is used in the manufacturing process for our sufentanil nanotabs  is flammable  and sufentanil is a highly potent  schedule ii compound 
these factors necessitate the use of specialized equipment and facilities for manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs 
there are a limited number of facilities that can accommodate our manufacturing process and we need to use dedicated equipment throughout development and commercial manufacturing to avoid the possibility of cross contamination 
if our equipment breaks down or needs to be repaired or replaced  it may cause significant disruption in clinical or commercial supply  which could result in delay in the process of obtaining approval for or sale of our products 
furthermore  we are using one manufacturer to produce our sufentanil nanotabs and have not identified a back up commercial facility to date 
any problems with our existing facility or equipment may delay or impair our ability to complete our clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates and increase our cost 
manufacturing issues may arise that could delay or increase costs related to product and regulatory approval and commercialization 
as we scale up manufacturing of our product candidates and conduct required stability testing  product  packaging  equipment and process related issues may require refinement or resolution in order to proceed with our planned clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for commercial marketing 
in the past we have identified impurities in our product candidates 
in the future we may identify significant impurities  which could result in increased scrutiny by the regulatory agencies  delays in clinical program and regulatory approval  increases in our operating expenses  or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products 
historically  we have manufactured the majority of our nanotab supplies at patheon in toronto  canada 
because the dea requires that sufentanil be manufactured in the united states if our product candidates are marketed in the united states  we transferred our manufacturing capability in the third quarter of from patheon in toronto  canada to patheon s production facility in cincinnati  ohio  where we have built out a suite within their existing buildings that will serve as a manufacturing facility for clinical and commercial supplies of nanotabs 
the new facility has been qualified  however  we have not yet produced commercial supplies out of this facility and we may encounter difficulties in production at the new facility  which may adversely affect our clinical and commercial plans 
in addition  the fda or other regulatory agencies may require that a bioequivalence study be conducted  which is designed to ensure that the phase drug lots made at patheon  toronto are equivalent to one of the registration drug lots made at patheon  cincinnati 
there is risk that this bioequivalence study could fail the fda s bioequivalence requirements which would adversely affect our clinical and commercial plans 

table of contents our designs for the pca device components of our nanotab system for phase clinical trials may not be fully functional or commercially viable 
the nanotab system device we are using in phase clinical trials and plan to use commercially  or the phase device  has more features than the device used in phase  including additional software 
we have conducted multiple design validation  software verification and validation  reprocessing and human factors studies  which have informed the design of the phase device and we plan to conduct additional human factors studies prior to submitting the planned nda for the nanotab system 
however  we cannot predict if the phase device will be fully functional or acceptable throughout all phase clinical trials or for commercial use 
if we need to modify the phase device either during or after the remaining phase clinical trials  we may incur higher costs and experience delay in regulatory approval and commercialization of the nanotab system 
furthermore  if the changes to the device are substantial  we may need to conduct further clinical trials in order to have the commercial device approved by the fda 
we have limited experience manufacturing the nanotab system phase device on a clinical scale  no experience on a commercial scale and do not own or operate a manufacturing facility 
we have manufactured the nanotab system devices and supplies on a small scale  including those needed for our phase clinical trials 
we continue to rely on contract manufacturers  component fabricators and secondary service providers to produce the necessary nanotab system devices for the remaining phase clinical trials and the commercial marketplace 
we currently outsource manufacturing and packaging of the controller  dispenser and cartridge components of the nanotab system device to third parties and intend to continue to do so 
these purchases of phase devices and components were made and will continue to be made utilizing short term purchase agreements and we may not be able to enter into long term agreements for commercial supply of the nanotab system devices with third party manufacturers  or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms 
we may encounter unanticipated problems in the scale up and automation process that will result in delays in the manufacturing of the nanotab system cartridge  dispenser or controller 
we may not be able to establish additional sources of supply for device manufacture 
such suppliers are subject to fda regulations requiring that materials be produced under current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps  or quality system regulations  or qsr  and subject to ongoing inspections by regulatory agencies 
failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in delays and interruptions to our product candidate supply while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product candidates ourselves  including the possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control  and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third parties because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities 
we rely on third parties to conduct  supervise and monitor our clinical trials  and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner  it may harm our business 
we have selected and executed agreements with cros to conduct our three phase clinical trials for the nanotab system and for the phase clinical trial for arx we will rely on these cros  as well as clinical trial sites  to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials 
while we have agreements governing their activities  we have limited influence over their actual performance 
we have relied and plan to continue to rely upon cros to monitor and manage data for our ongoing clinical programs for the nanotab system and our other product candidates  as well as the execution of nonclinical trials 
we control only certain aspects of our cros activities 
nevertheless  we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol  legal  regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the cros does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities 
we and our cros are required to comply with the fda s current good clinical practices  or cgcps  which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the fda for all of our product candidates in clinical development 
the 
table of contents fda enforces these cgcps through periodic inspections of trial sponsors  principal investigators and clinical trial sites 
if we or our cros fail to comply with applicable cgcps  the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications 
upon inspection  the fda may determine that our phase clinical trials do not comply with cgcps 
in addition  our phase clinical trials will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the nanotab system 
accordingly  if our cros fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients  we may be required to repeat the phase clinical trials  which would delay the regulatory approval process 
our cros are not our employees  and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and nonclinical programs 
these cros may also have relationships with other commercial entities  including our competitors  for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials  or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position 
we face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by cros  which may allow our potential competitors to access our proprietary technology 
if our cros do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations  fail to meet expected deadlines  or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements  or for any other reasons  our clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for  or successfully commercialize the nanotab system  or our other product candidates 
as a result  our financial results and the commercial prospects for the nanotab system and any future product candidates that we develop would be harmed  our costs could increase  and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed 
development of arx is dependent on funding from our government grant with the usamrmc 
in may  we received a grant from the usamrmc  effective june   in which the usamrmc granted million to us in order to support the development of arx under the terms of the grant  the usamrmc will reimburse us for development  manufacturing and clinical costs necessary to prepare for and complete our ongoing phase dose finding trial for the treatment of moderate to severe pain  and to prepare to enter into planned phase development 
the period of research under the grant ends january  the grant gives the usamrmc the option to extend the term of the grant and provide additional funding for the research 
development of arx is dependent on the continued performance by the usamrmc of its responsibilities under this agreement  including adequate continued funding of usamrmc programs 
we have no control over the resources and funding that usamrmc may devote to this or future agreements  which may be subject to annual renewal and which generally may be terminated by usamrmc at any time 
usamrmc may fail to perform their responsibilities under the agreement  which may result in the termination of the agreement 
in addition  we may fail to perform our responsibilities under the agreement  which may also lead to the termination of this agreement 
our government agreement is subject to audits  which may occur several years after the period to which the audit relates 
if an audit identifies significant unallowable costs  we could incur a material charge to our earnings or reduction in our cash position 
as a result  we may be unsuccessful in entering  or ineligible to enter  into future government agreements 
there can be no assurances that this agreement will continue or that we will be able to enter into new contracts with usamrmc or obtain funding from other sources to continue to support development of arx beyond the phase clinical trial and preparation for phase activities 
the process of obtaining usamrmc contracts is lengthy and uncertain and we will have to compete with other companies for each contract 
further  changes in government budgets and agendas may result in a decreased and de prioritized emphasis on supporting research and development programs  including arx 
table of contents risks related to commercialization of our product candidates the commercial success of the nanotab system and our other product candidates will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community  including physicians  nurses  patients  and pharmacy and therapeutics committees 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors  including demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products  the relative convenience  ease of administration and acceptance by physicians  patients and health care payors  the prevalence and severity of any aes or saes  overcoming the perception of sufentanil as a potentially unsafe drug due to its high potency  limitations or warnings contained in the fda approved label for the nanotab system  availability of alternative treatments  existing capital investment by hospitals in iv pca technology  pricing and cost effectiveness  the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators sales and marketing strategies  our ability to obtain hospital formulary approval  our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third party coverage or reimbursement  and the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket in the absence of third party coverage 
if the nanotab system is approved  but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians  nurses  patients and pharmacy and therapeutics committees  or p t committees  we may not generate sufficient revenue from the nanotab system and we may not become or remain profitable 
if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates  we may be unable to generate any revenue 
we currently do not have an organization for the sales  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost effectiveness of doing so 
in order to market any products that may be approved  we must build our sales  marketing  managerial and other non technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
we intend to enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates outside of the united states 
we will also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for our product candidates in the united states 
to date  we have not entered into any strategic partnerships for any of our product candidates 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners  and these strategic partnerships can be intricate and time consuming to negotiate and document 
we may not be able to negotiate strategic partnerships on acceptable terms  or at all 
we are unable to predict when  if ever  we will enter into any strategic partnerships because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic partnerships 
our strategy for the nanotab system is to develop a hospital directed sales force and or collaborate with third parties to promote the product to healthcare professionals and third party payors in the united states 
our future collaboration partners  if any  may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the sale of our product candidates to healthcare professionals and in geographical regions  including the united states  that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force  or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize our product candidates  our ability to generate revenues from product sales will be adversely affected 

table of contents until we are able to negotiate a strategic partnership or obtain additional financial resources for arx or arx  we will not progress development or generate any revenue from these product candidates 
we are developing arx under a grant from usamrmc and if new funding from usamrmc to cover phase costs is not obtained  we may be required to curtail all activities associated with arx in addition  without a partnership or additional grant funding  we would bear all the risk related to the development of arx  arx and arx if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities ourselves  we will need to obtain additional capital  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we do not have sufficient funds  we will not be able to bring arx  arx or arx to market or generate product revenue 
if we are unable to establish adequate sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  whether independently or with third parties  we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue and may not become profitable 
we will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions  we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies 
if we obtain approval to commercialize our products outside of the united states  a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business 
if our product candidates are approved for commercialization  we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market the nanotab system outside the united states 
we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships  including different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  unexpected changes in tariffs  trade barriers and regulatory requirements  economic weakness  including inflation  or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets  compliance with tax  employment  immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad  foreign taxes  including withholding of payroll taxes  foreign currency fluctuations  which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues  and other obligations incident to doing business in another country  workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the united states  production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad  and business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions  including war and terrorism  or natural disasters including earthquakes  typhoons  floods and fires 
if we  or potential partners  are unable to compete effectively  our product candidates may not reach their commercial potential 
the market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances 
if our product candidates obtain fda approval  they will compete with a number of existing and future pharmaceuticals and drug delivery devices developed  manufactured and marketed by others 
we or potential partners will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations 

table of contents we believe that the nanotab system would compete with a number of opioid based treatment options that are currently available 
the market for opioids for post operative pain is large and competitive 
the primary competition for the nanotab system is the iv pca pump  which is widely used in the post operative setting 
leading manufacturers of iv pca pumps include hospira inc  carefusion corporation  baxter international inc  curlin medical  inc 
and smiths medical 
the most common opioids used to treat post operative pain are morphine  hydromorphone and fentanyl  all of which are available as generics 
also available on the market is the avancen medication on demand  or mod  oral pca device developed by avancen mod corporation 
additional potential competitors for the nanotab system include products in development  including the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system  ionsys  originally developed by alza corporation and ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  both johnson johnson subsidiaries  and currently under development by incline therapeutics  inc  which was acquired by the medicines company also in development is moxduo  an orally administered  fixed ratio combination of morphine and oxycodone being developed by qrx pharma  an australian company 
this drug is also in development as an iv product 
our potential competitors for arx include products approved in the united states for cancer breakthrough pain  including actiq and fentora  currently manufactured by teva pharmaceuticals  onsolis  currently manufactured by biodelivery sciences international  inc  abstral  currently manufactured by prostrakan group plc  lazanda  currently manufactured by archimedes pharma limited  as well as products approved in europe  including instanyl  currently manufactured by nycomed international management gmbh 
the active ingredient in all approved products for cancer breakthrough pain is fentanyl 
additional potential competitors for arx include products in late stage development for cancer breakthrough pain  such as fentanyl taifun  currently manufactured by akela pharma  inc  and sl spray  currently manufactured by insys therapeutics  inc we are not aware of any approved or development stage non iv sedative analgesic products that would present competition to arx in the future  there may be products developed or approved for this market which could directly compete with arx competitors for arx within the military environment include intramuscular morphine injections which are marketed by a variety of generic manufacturers 
within the civilian environment  there are a wide variety of approved injectable and oral opioid products to treat moderate to severe acute pain  including iv opioids such as morphine  fentanyl  hydromorphone and meperidine or oral opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone 
it is possible that any of these competitors could develop or improve technologies or products that would render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive  which could adversely affect our revenue potential 
key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy  safety profile  reliability  convenience of dosing  price and reimbursement 
many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates  obtaining fda and other regulatory approval of products and the commercialization of those products 
accordingly  our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining fda approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance 
our competitors drugs or drug delivery systems may be more effective  have fewer adverse effects  be less expensive to develop and manufacture  or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidate we may commercialize 
this may render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive before we can recover our losses 
we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and additional technologies become available 
these entities may also establish collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors  which may adversely affect our competitive position 
finally  the development of different methods for the treatment of post operative pain or breakthrough pain could render the nanotab system and arx  respectively  non competitive or obsolete 
these and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations 

table of contents hospital formulary approval and reimbursement may not be available for the nanotab system and our other product candidates  which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably 
obtaining formulary approval can be an expensive and time consuming process 
we cannot be certain if and when we will obtain formulary approval to allow us to sell our products into our target markets 
failure to obtain timely formulary approval will limit our commercial success 
furthermore  market acceptance and sales of the nanotab system  or any of our other product candidates  will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures 
government authorities and third party payors  such as private health insurers  hospitals and health maintenance organizations  decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels 
we cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for the nanotab system  or any of our other product candidates 
also  reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for  or the price of  our products 
if reimbursement is not available  or is available only to limited levels  we may not be able to successfully commercialize the nanotab system  or any of our other product candidates 
there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
these legislative and or regulatory changes may negatively impact the reimbursement for our products  following approval 
the availability of numerous generic pain medications may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for the nanotab system or any of our other product candidates 
the application of user fees to generic drug products may expedite the approval of additional pain medication generic drugs 
we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with any sale of the nanotab system and any of our other product candidates  due to the trend toward managed healthcare  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes 
if we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so  we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed 
risks related to our business operations and industry failure to comply with the drug enforcement administration regulations  or the cost of compliance with these regulations  may adversely affect our business 
our sufentanil based products are subject to extensive regulation by the dea  due to their status as scheduled drugs 
sufentanil is a schedule ii opioid  considered to present the highest risk of abuse 
the manufacture  shipment  storage  sale and use of controlled substances are subject to a high degree of regulation  including security  record keeping and reporting obligations enforced by the dea 
this high degree of regulation can result in significant costs in order to comply with the required regulations  which may have an adverse effect on the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the dea limits the availability and production of all schedule ii substances  including sufentanil  through a quota system 
the dea requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning quotas to manufacturers 
our contract manufacturers have applied annually for a quota on our behalf 
in future years  we may need greater amounts of sufentanil to continue development of our product candidates  and we will need significantly greater amounts of sufentanil to implement our commercialization plans for any of our products that may be approved by the fda  including the nanotab system if approved by the fda 
any delay or refusal by the dea in establishing the procurement quota or a reduction in our quota for sufentanil or a failure to increase it over time to meet anticipated increases in demand could delay or stop the clinical development or commercial sale of the nanotab system or any of our other product candidates 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 

table of contents we have not yet produced commercial supplies and we may encounter difficulties in production  which may adversely affect our clinical and commercial plans 
a substantial portion of our clinical trial manufacturing to date has been completed at patheon in toronto  canada 
because the dea requires that sufentanil be manufactured in the united states if our product candidates are marketed in the united states  we transferred our manufacturing capability in the third quarter of from patheon in toronto  canada to patheon s production facility in cincinnati  ohio  where we have built out a suite within their existing buildings that will serve as a manufacturing facility for clinical and commercial supplies of nanotabs 
the new facility has been qualified  however  we have not yet produced commercial supplies out of this facility and we may encounter difficulties in production at the new facility  or otherwise  which may adversely affect our clinical and commercial plans 
in january  we entered into an manufacturing services agreement  or the services agreement  with patheon pharmaceuticals  inc  or patheon  for use with the nanotab system 
under the terms of the services agreement  patheon has agreed to manufacture  supply  and provide certain validation and stability services with respect to the nanotab system for sale in the united states  canada  mexico and other countries  subject to agreement by the parties to any additional fees for such other countries 
there is no guarantee  however  that patheon s services will be satisfactory or that they will continue to meet the strict regulatory guidelines of the fda or other regulatory agencies 
in addition  we entered into a capital expenditure and equipment agreement  or the capital agreement  relating to the manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs 
under the terms of the capital agreement  we have planned certain future modifications to patheon s cincinnati facility  the aggregate cost of which is expected to be less than million 
if equipment manufacture or modifications do not meet expected deadlines  the timing for our planned nda submission for the nanotab system may be delayed 
switching or adding commercial manufacturing capability can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus  as well as additional regulatory filings 
in addition  there is a natural transition period when a new manufacturing facility commences work 
as a result  delays may occur  which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired commercial timelines  thereby increasing our costs and reducing our ability to generate revenue 
the facilities of any of our future manufacturers of sufentanil containing nanotabs must be approved by the fda after we submit our planned nda and before approval of the nanotab system and our other product candidates 
we do not control the manufacturing process of sufentanil nanotabs and are completely dependent on these third party manufacturing partners for compliance with the fda s requirements for manufacture 
in addition  although our third party manufacturers are well established commercial manufacturers  we are dependent on their continued adherence to cgmp manufacturing and acceptable changes to their process 
if our manufacturers do not meet the fda s strict regulatory requirements  they will not be able to secure fda approval for their manufacturing facilities 
if the fda does not approve these facilities for the commercial manufacture of sufentanil nanotabs  we will need to find alternative suppliers  which would result in significant delays in obtaining fda approval for the nanotab system 
these challenges may have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
business interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our products and could disrupt our sales 
our headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area  near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes 
we are also vulnerable to other types of natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations 
we do not carry insurance for earthquakes or other natural disasters and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur 
any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 

table of contents our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we are highly dependent on principal members of our executive team  the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives 
while we have entered into offer letters with each of our executive officers  any of them could leave our employment at any time  as all of our employees are at will employees 
recruiting and retaining other qualified employees for our business  including scientific and technical personnel  will also be critical to our success 
there is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry  which is likely to continue 
as a result  competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets 
in addition  failure to succeed in clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
the inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee might impede the progress of our research  development and commercialization objectives 
we will need to expand our organization  and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth  which could disrupt our operations 
as of december   we only had full time employees 
as our company matures  we expect to expand our employee base to increase our managerial  scientific and engineering  operational  sales  marketing  financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors 
future growth would impose significant additional responsibilities on our management  including the need to identify  recruit  maintain  motivate and integrate additional employees  consultants and contractors 
also  our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day to day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities 
we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations  which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure  give rise to operational mistakes  loss of business opportunities  loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees 
our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects  such as the development of additional product candidates 
if our management is unable to effectively manage our growth  our expenses may increase more than expected  our ability to generate and or grow revenues could be reduced  and we may not be able to implement our business strategy 
our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize the nanotab system and our other product candidates and compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to effectively manage any future growth 
we face potential product liability  and  if successful claims are brought against us  we may incur substantial liability 
the use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers  health care providers  pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products 
if we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims  we could incur substantial liability and costs 
in addition  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in impairment of our business reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  costs due to related litigation  distraction of management s attention from our primary business  substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants  the inability to commercialize our product candidates  and decreased demand for our product candidates  if approved for commercial sale 

table of contents our current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer 
moreover  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability 
if and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates  we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products  however  we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts 
on occasion  large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and  if judgments exceed our insurance coverage  could adversely affect our results of operations and business 
risks related to our intellectual property if we cannot defend our issued patents from third party claims or if our pending patent applications fail to issue  our business could be adversely affected 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on patents as well as other intellectual property protections including trade secrets  nondisclosure agreements  and confidentiality provisions 
as of january   we are the owner of record of one issued european patent  including national validation in ten countries  which expires in  one issued european patent  including national validation in ten countries  which expires in  one mexican patent which expires in  five issued us patents which provide coverage through at least  and one issued us patent which provides coverage through at least in addition  we are pursuing us non provisional patent applications  and foreign national applications  including five european regional phase applications directed to our product candidates 
one of our issued us patents  patent number  covers key features of our arx pca device  but we have not yet obtained any issued patents that provide protection for key features of our arx  arx and arx sdas independent of the drug composition used in them 
the patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the united states or in foreign countries 
even if the patents do successfully issue  third parties may challenge the patents 
our commercial success will depend in part on successfully defending our current sufentanil formulation patents against third party challenges and expanding our existing formulation patent portfolio to provide additional layers of patent protection  as well as extending patent protection to our proprietary delivery devices 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending our existing and future patents against third party challenges  or that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies  including us  can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the united states 
legal developments may preclude or limit the scope of available patent protection 
there is also no assurance that any patents issued to us will not become the subject of a re examination or other post grant review  will provide us with competitive advantages  will not be challenged by any third parties  or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology 
furthermore  there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of our products  or design around our patents 
litigation involving patents  patent applications and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming 
if we are involved in such litigation  it could cause delays in bringing our product candidates to market and interfere with our business 
our commercial success depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
although we are not currently aware of litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates  the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 

table of contents as we enter our target markets  it is possible that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products and or processes infringe their intellectual property rights 
these third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents covering products or processes that are similar to  or may include compositions or methods that encompass our technology  allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents 
in a patent infringement claim against us  we may assert  as a defense  that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims  that the patent is invalid or both 
the strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted  the interpretation of these patents  and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents 
however  we could be unsuccessful in advancing non infringement and or invalidity arguments in our defense 
in the united states  issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity  and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity  which is a high burden of proof 
conversely  the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence  which is a lower burden of proof 
if we were found by a court to have infringed a valid patent claim  we could be prevented from using the patented technology or be required to pay the owner of the patent for the right to license the patented technology 
if we decide to pursue a license to one or more of these patents  we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or the license we obtain may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patent rights 
for example  if the relevant patent is owned by a competitor  that competitor may choose not to license patent rights to us 
if we decide to develop alternative technology  we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost effective manner  if at all 
in addition  because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time there may currently be pending applications  unknown to us  that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products 
it is possible that we may in the future receive  particularly as a public company  communications from competitors and other companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents  trade secrets or other intellectual property rights  offering licenses to such intellectual property or threatening litigation 
in addition to patent infringement claims  third parties may assert copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights against us 
we may need to expend considerable resources to counter such claims and may not be able to successful in our defense 
our business may suffer if a finding of infringement is established 
it is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights  and we may not be able to ensure their protection 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the united states 
the pharmaceutical patent situation outside the united states is even more uncertain 
changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property 
for example  on september   the leahy smith america invents act  or the leahy smith act  was signed into law 
the leahy smith act includes a number of significant changes to united states patent law 
these include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation 
the united states patent office has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the leahy smith act  and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the leahy smith act  and in particular  the first to file provisions  will not become effective until march  accordingly  it is too early to tell what  if any  impact the leahy smith act will have on the operation of our business 
however  the leahy smith act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
accordingly  we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that may be issued from the applications we currently or may in the future own or license from third parties 
further  if any patents license we obtain is deemed invalid and or unenforceable  it could impact our ability to commercialize or partner our technology 

table of contents competitors or third parties may infringe our patents 
we may be required to file patent infringement claims  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or that the third party s technology does not in fact infringe upon our patents 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our related pending patent applications at risk of not issuing 
litigation may fail and  even if successful  may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management 
we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries outside the united states where patent rights may be more difficult to enforce 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential or sensitive information could be compromised by disclosure in the event of litigation 
in addition  during the course of litigation there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain  and we cannot ensure that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications  we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  any patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products  will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business 
if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have  which could materially harm our business  negatively affect our position in the marketplace  limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability 
we may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information 
we rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know how and technological advances  especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  outside scientific collaborators  sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights 
failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional  material adverse effects upon our competitive business position 
periodic maintenance fees  renewal fees  annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and or applications will be due to be paid to the united states patent and trademark office and various foreign governmental patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and or applications 
we have systems in place  including use of third party vendors  to manage payment of periodic maintenance fees  renewal fees  annuity fees and various other patent and application fees 
the united states patent and trademark office  or the uspto  and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural  documentary  fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process 
there 
table of contents are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application  resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction 
if this occurs  our competitors might be able to enter the market  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the legal systems of some countries  particularly developing countries  do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection  especially those relating to life sciences 
this could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights 
for example  many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties 
in addition  many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties  including government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  patents may provide limited or no benefit 
proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
accordingly  our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate 
in addition  changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the united states and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property 
we have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets  and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business 
we have registered our acelrx mark in the united states  canada  the european union and india 
we have also registered our nanotab mark in the united states  hong kong and singapore  and our accelerate 
innovate 
alleviate 
tagline in the united states 
although we are not currently aware of any oppositions to or cancellations of our registered trademarks or pending applications  it is possible that one or more of the applications could be subject to opposition or cancellation after the marks are registered 
the registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements 
it is also possible that we have not yet registered all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets  and that there are names or symbols other than acelrx that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration  and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business 
opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile 
prior to our initial public offering  or ipo  in february  there was no public market for our common stock 
an active public trading market for our common stock has not developed and may never develop or  if developed  may not be sustained 
moreover  the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following adverse results or delays in clinical trials  inability to obtain additional funding  including funding necessary for the planned commercialization and manufacturing of the nanotab system in the united states and advancement of clinical trials for other product candidates  any delay in submitting an nda for any of our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the fda s filing or review of that nda  failure to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates  
table of contents changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products  inability to obtain adequate product supply for our product candidates  or the inability to do so at acceptable prices  adverse regulatory decisions  introduction of new products  services or technologies by our competitors  failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public  failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community  the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public  legislatures  regulators and the investment community  announcements of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors  disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights  including patents  litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies  additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel  significant lawsuits  including patent or stockholder litigation  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future  and trading volume of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market  or nasdaq  in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
our common stock is thinly traded and in the future  may continue to be thinly traded  and our stockholders may be unable to sell at or near asking prices or at all if they need to sell their shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate such shares 
to date  we have a low volume of daily trades in our common stock on nasdaq 
for example  the average daily trading volume in our common stock on nasdaq during the fourth quarter of was approximately  shares per day 
our stockholders may be unable to sell their common stock at or near their asking prices or at all  which may result in substantial losses to our stockholders 
the market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers  and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future 
as noted above  our common stock may be sporadically and or thinly traded 
as a consequence of this lack of liquidity  the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction 
the price for our shares could  for example  decline significantly in the event that a large number of our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand  as compared to a seasoned issuer that could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price 

table of contents our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval 
our executive officers and directors  together with the stockholders with whom our executive officers and directors are affiliated or associated  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding voting stock as of january  therefore  these stockholders have the ability to influence us through this ownership position 
these stockholders are able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval 
for example  these stockholders  acting together  are able to control elections of directors  amendments of our organizational documents  or approval of any merger  sale of assets  or other major corporate transaction 
this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 
we incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company  and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  as amended  or the sarbanes oxley act  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and nasdaq  have imposed various requirements on public companies 
our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives 
moreover  these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly 
for example  these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage 
as a public company  we are subject to the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
if we are unable to comply with section in a timely manner  it may affect the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting 
assessing our staffing and training procedures to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process 
we plan to continue to assess our internal controls and procedures and intend to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other matters we identify 
however  our independent registered public accounting firm is not currently required to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as we qualify for an exemption as a non accelerated filer under the applicable sec rules and regulations 
we have been and will continue to be involved in a substantial effort to implement appropriate processes  document the system of internal control over key processes  assess their design  remediate any deficiencies identified and test their operation 
we cannot be certain at this time whether our measures to improve internal controls will be successful  that we will be able to successfully complete the procedures  certification and attestation requirements of section or that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
if we fail to comply with the requirements of section  it may affect the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting and negatively impact the quality of disclosure to our stockholders 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify and report a material weakness  it could adversely affect our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
we are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock 
as of january   we had  shares of common 
table of contents stock outstanding  all of which is eligible for sale in the public market  subject in some cases to the volume limitations and manner of sale requirements of rule under the securities act 
sales of stock by our stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  certain holders of our securities are entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration of their shares of common stock under the securities act 
registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act 
any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock  including pursuant to our equity incentive plans  could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall 
we expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  including pursuant to our sales agreement with mlv  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
we may sell common stock  convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time 
if we sell common stock  convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction  investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales 
these sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders  and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders 
pursuant to our equity incentive plan  or the incentive plan  our management is authorized to grant stock options and other equity based awards to our employees  directors and consultants 
the number of shares available for future grant under our incentive plan will automatically increase each year by of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of december of the prior calendar year  subject to the ability of our board of directors to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year 
currently  we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under our incentive plan each year 
if our board of directors elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant by the maximum amount each year  our stockholders may experience additional dilution  which could cause our stock price to fall 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years 
if we face such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 
under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change  generally defined as a greater than change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period  the corporation s ability to use its pre change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre change tax attributes such as research tax credits to offset its post change income may be limited 
our public offering in december  together with our initial public offering  private placements and other transactions that have occurred  may trigger such an ownership change 
in addition  since we will need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our operations  we may undergo further ownership changes in the future 
as a result  if we earn net taxable income  our ability to use our pre change net operating loss carryforwards to offset united states federal taxable income may be subject to limitations  which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us 

table of contents we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock  and we are prohibited from doing so under the terms of our loan and security agreement with hercules 
regardless of the restrictions in our loan and security agreement with hercules or the terms of any potential future indebtedness  we anticipate that we will retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business and  therefore  we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions  including our financial condition  operating results  contractual restrictions  capital requirements  business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management 
some provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may have anti takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval  limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders  creating a staggered board of directors  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings 
these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management 
in addition  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder  unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders 
further  other provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us

overview we are a development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of acute and breakthrough pain 
our lead product candidate  the sufentanil nanotab pca system  or the nanotab system  or arx  is designed to improve the management of moderate to severe acute post operative pain in patients in the hospital setting 
although widely used  the current standard of care for patients with post operative pain  intravenous patient controlled analgesia  or iv pca  has been shown to cause harm and inconvenience to patients following surgery because of the side effects of morphine  the invasive iv needle route of delivery and the inherent potential for programming and delivery errors associated with the complexity of infusion pumps 
sufentanil nanotab system the nanotab system is an investigational pre programmed  non invasive  handheld system that allows post operative patients to self dose with sublingual sufentanil nanotabs to manage their post operative pain 
the nanotab system is designed to address the limitations of iv pca by offering a high therapeutic index opioid the nanotab system uses the high therapeutic index opioid sufentanil  it offers post operative pain patients the potential for effective patient controlled analgesia with a low incidence of drug related side effects 
a non invasive route of delivery the sublingual route of delivery used by the nanotab system provides rapid onset of analgesia  therefore eliminating the risk of iv related analgesic gaps and iv complications  such as catheter related infections 
in addition  because patients are not tethered to iv tubing and a pump for pain relief  the nanotab system allows for ease of patient mobility 
a simple  pre programmed pca solution the nanotab system is a pre programmed pca system designed to eliminate the risk of pump programming errors 
our phase clinical program for the nanotab system consists of two placebo controlled efficacy and safety trials and an open label active comparator trial  in which the nanotab system was compared to iv pca 
a summary of phase trials and results to date is as follows in march  we reported top line data showing that the primary endpoint was achieved in a pivotal  double blind  placebo controlled  phase trial of the nanotab system for post operative pain in major open abdominal surgery patients 
in november  we reported top line data showing that the primary endpoint of non inferiority was met in an open label active comparator phase clinical trial 
in the second quarter of  we expect data from our final planned pivotal phase trial  a double blind  placebo controlled efficacy and safety trial in patients with acute post operative pain following hip and knee replacement surgeries 
in the third quarter of  we intend to submit an nda to the fda  contingent upon receipt of successful data from the remaining nanotab system phase clinical trial 

table of contents arx we are also developing a sufentanil single dose nanotab  or arx  for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain on the battlefield  in the emergency room or in ambulatory care facilities 
in may  we announced that the us army medical research and materiel command  or usamrmc  awarded us a million grant to support the development of arx for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain 
in november  we initiated our arx phase dose finding trial  a prospective  randomized  double blind multicenter trial in patients that are undergoing primary  unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy surgery alone or with ipsilateral hammertoe repair 
in february  dosing of the last patient in this trial was completed 
this trial enrolled patients and top line results from the trial are expected during the second quarter of in addition to our nanotab system and arx  our product candidate pipeline consists of two other sufentanil based product candidates 
the sufentanil nanotab btp management system  or arx  is a pain management system for the treatment of cancer patients who suffer from breakthrough pain  or btp 
the sufentanil triazolam nanotab  or arx  is a single  fixed dose product designed to provide mild sedation  anxiety reduction and pain relief for patients undergoing painful procedures in a physician s office 
we have successfully completed phase clinical trials for arx and arx future development of arx and arx is contingent upon identification of corporate partnership resources 
development of therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 
financial overview we are a development stage company with a limited operating history 
we have incurred net losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
in order to develop our product candidates as commercially viable therapeutics  we expect to expend significant resources for expertise in the manufacturing  regulatory affairs  clinical research and other aspects of pharmaceutical development 
in addition  as we pursue commercial development of our product candidates we expect the business aspects of our company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturation of our business 
our net losses were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million compared to million as of december  to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and the issuance of debt instruments 
in december  we completed an underwritten public offering  pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share for an aggregate offering price of million 
as a result of the offering  we received net proceeds of million  after underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses totaling million 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement with hercules technology ii  lp and hercules technology growth capital  inc  collectively referred to as hercules  under which we borrowed million in two tranches of million each  represented by secured convertible term promissory notes 
the interest rate is  with the initial months of the facility requiring interest only payments 
the notes issued pursuant to the loan and security agreement mature on december  since entering into the agreement with hercules  we have been making monthly interest only payments to hercules of approximately  per month until june  
table of contents according to the terms of the hercules agreement  beginning on july   we began repaying hercules principal  with equal monthly payments of  consisting of both principal and interest payments until the maturity date of the loan 
as of december   the outstanding principal owed to hercules was million 
since our inception in july  we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our products and do not anticipate generating any product revenues for the foreseeable future  if at all 
we have recognized revenue associated with our grant from the usamrmc of million since inception of the grant  but continued funding from the usamrmc is contingent upon their review and approval of our continued research and development activities associated with the grant 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive other research related grant awards or produce other collaborative agreement revenues in the future 
critical accounting estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the following estimates with the audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in may  we entered into an award contract with the us army medical research and materiel command  or usamrmc  to support the development of the company s product candidate  arx  a sufentanil nanotab for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain on the battlefield  in the emergency room or in ambulatory care facilities 
the grant provides for the reimbursement of qualified expenses for research and development activities as defined under the terms of the grant agreement 
revenue under the grant agreement is recognized when the related qualified research expenses are incurred 
research and development expenses we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of direct and research related allocated overhead costs such as facilities costs  salaries and related personnel costs  and material and supply costs 
in addition  research and development expenses include costs related to clinical trials to validate our testing processes and procedures and related overhead expenses 
expenses resulting from clinical trials are recorded when incurred based in part on factors such as estimates of work performed  patient enrollment  progress of patient studies and other events 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 

table of contents share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee share purchase plan  or espp  on estimated fair values 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award using a straight line method 
to estimate the value of an award  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires inputs such as expected life  expected volatility and risk free interest rate 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
estimates of expected life are primarily determined using the simplified method in accordance with guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
volatility is derived from historical volatilities of several public companies within our industry that are deemed to be comparable to our business because we have limited information on the volatility of our common stock since we had no trading history prior to completion of our ipo in february the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected life assumption 
we review our valuation assumptions quarterly and  as a result  it is likely we will change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
further  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in determining the fair value of stock based awards  the stock based compensation expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
prior to the ipo  we were also required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock based awards when performing the fair value calculations with the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair values of the common stock underlying our stock based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors  with input from management 
in valuing our common stock  our board of directors determined the equity value of our business by taking a weighted combination of the value indications under two valuation approaches  an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach estimates the present value of future estimated cash flows  based upon forecasted revenue and costs 
these future cash flows were discounted to their present values using a discount rate derived from an analysis of the cost of capital of comparable publicly traded companies in our industry or similar lines of business as of each valuation date and was adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows 
the market approach estimated the fair value by applying market multiples of comparable publicly traded companies in our industry or similar lines of business which were based on key metrics implied by the enterprise values or acquisition values of our comparable publicly traded companies 
liabilities associated with warrants warrants to purchase common stock in connection with the private placement equity financing in june  or pipe  the company issued pipe warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
under the terms of the pipe warrants  upon certain transactions  including a merger  tender offer  sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company or if a person or group shall become the owner of of the company s issued and outstanding common stock  which is outside of the company s control  each pipe warrant holder may elect to receive a cash payment in exchange for the warrant  in an amount determined by application of the black scholes option pricing model 
accordingly  the pipe warrants are recorded as a liability at fair value at the end of each reporting period  as determined by the black scholes option pricing model and changes to the fair value are recorded in other income expense 
the inputs for the black scholes option pricing model include exercise price of the pipe warrants  market price of the underlying common shares  expected term  volatility based on a group of the company s peers and the risk free rate corresponding to the expected term of the pipe warrants 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
changes to the inputs could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the pipe warrants 

table of contents warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock were classified as liabilities on our balance sheets at fair value because the warrants could have conditionally obligated us to redeem the underlying convertible preferred stock 
the warrants were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date  and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of other income expense  net  in the statements of operations 
we estimated the fair value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
we used assumptions to estimate the fair value of the warrants including the remaining contractual terms of the warrants  risk free interest rates  expected dividend yields and the fair value and expected volatility of the underlying stock 
these assumptions were subjective and the fair value of the warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock could have differed significantly had we used different assumptions 
upon the completion of our ipo in february  all of our warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock had been exercised or converted into warrants to purchase common stock 
at that time  the then current aggregate fair value of these warrants was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid in capital and we will no longer remeasure the liability associated with these warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock to fair value 
bridge loan on september   we entered into a bridge loan financing  in which we issued notes to certain existing investors for an aggregate purchase price of million  or the notes 
the notes could not be prepaid without the written consent of the holders of the notes  bore interest at a rate of per annum and had a maturity date of the earliest of september  or an event of default 
the principal and the interest under the notes were converted into common stock in connection with our ipo at a conversion price equal to of the ipo price  or per share 
under the terms of the bridge loan agreement  upon the election of the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount payable under the notes  we agreed to issue an additional million of the notes 
this additional million was determined to be a call option that was recorded at its fair value of million as a debt discount that was amortized to interest expense during the period when the notes were outstanding until conversion in connection with our ipo 
the fair value of the call option was determined by evaluating multiple potential outcomes using a market approach and an income approach depending on the scenario and discounted these values back to december  while applying estimated probabilities to each scenario value 
as of december   these scenarios included a potential ipo  merger or sale at different times during and as well as remaining private 
during the quarter ending march   the notes were amended so that the call option expired upon the closing of our ipo 
also in connection with the bridge loan financing  we issued warrants  or the warrants  with a fair value of million  which was recorded as a debt discount that was amortized to interest expense during the period where the warrants were outstanding until exercised at the time of the ipo as detailed above in warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock 
we used considerable judgment in determining the fair value of these instruments and had we used different assumptions  the resulting fair values could have been materially different 
subsequent to december   and in conjunction with our ipo  the principal and accrued interest under the notes converted into  shares of common stock and the warrants were exercised on a net issuance basis for  shares of series c convertible preferred stock  which such shares of series c convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into  shares of common stock immediately prior to the closing of our ipo 

table of contents income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  any uncertain tax positions  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans 
as of december   and  we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  we have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
accordingly  there have not been significant changes to our provision or benefit for income taxes during the years ended december   or as of december   and  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  million and million  respectively  and state net operating loss carryforwards of million  million and million  respectively 
we also had million  million and million of federal research credit carryforwards  and million  million and million of state research credit carryforwards as of december   and realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in and the state net operating loss will begin expiring in under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change  generally defined as a greater than change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period  the corporation s ability to use its pre change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre change tax attributes  such as research tax credits  to offset its post change income may be limited 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue to date  we have not generated any product revenue 
we do not expect to receive any revenues from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our products or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties 
in may  we received a grant award of million from the usamrmc for the development of arx  a sufentanil nanotab for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain 
revenue related to this grant award is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred 
revenue for the year ended december  and was and million  respectively  and was generated from our grant with the usamrmc 
we did not generate any revenue for the year ended december  research and development expenses conducting research and development is central to our business model 
the majority of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities related to the nanotab system 
research and development expenses included the following expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and clinical trial sites  employee and consultant related expenses  which include salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  
table of contents payments to third party pharmaceutical and engineering development contractors  payments to third party manufacturers  and depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supply costs 
product candidates in late stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development  primarily due to the increased size and duration of late stage clinical trials 
we anticipate that quarterly research and development expenses during the first half of will be in line with or modestly higher than the fourth quarter of as we conduct and complete the phase clinical trials for the nanotab system and the arx phase clinical trial 
however  we will incur substantial future expenditures as we seek to continue development of the nanotab system  including the requisite preparatory activities to submit an nda to the fda and activities associated with preparing for the potential commercialization of the nanotab system 
we do not plan to continue development of arx beyond the current grant supported activities  and arx and arx  unless additional funding or corporate partnership resources are available to support these programs 
we track external development expenses on a program by program basis 
our development resources are shared among all of our programs 
compensation and benefits  facilities  depreciation  stock based compensation  and development support services are not allocated specifically to projects and are considered research and development overhead 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses during the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  arx nanotab system arx arx arx overhead total research and development expenses due to the inherently unpredictable nature of product development  development timelines and the probability of success  development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing the nanotab system and arx  and subsequently arx and arx  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate as well as ongoing assessments of the commercial potential of our product candidates 
in addition  we cannot predict which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations  when these arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree these arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future  in particular to support our product development activities 
we believe that our available cash resources  will be sufficient to fund our operations into the third quarter of  including support for our continuing development of our product candidates  clinical trials and commercial readiness activities 
future capital requirements will be substantial and we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations  including product candidate development activities 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
additional capital may not be available in terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  or if the terms underlying potential funding sources are unfavorable  our business and our ability to develop our technology and product candidates would be harmed 
our future capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors and are not limited to the following the initiation  progress  timing and completion of clinical trials for our product candidates and potential product candidates  the outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements  the number of product candidates that we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims
