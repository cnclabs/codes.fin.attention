through partnerships with leading regional corporate travel agencies  orbitz for business offers its services in over countries across europe  latin america  africa  asia including china and india and the pacific rim 
in the first quarter of  orbitz for business launched orbitz for business express to offer savings  convenience and professional travel services to small businesses with travel needs  including those currently without a managed travel program 
orbitz worldwide distribution group we offer third parties  such as airlines and hotel partners  a full range of private label solutions  ranging from the building and hosting of custom websites to supplying content feeds with availability and rate data to partners websites 
we license our technology and business services to these partners  and using our technology  these partners are able to provide a wide range of travel products on their websites under their own brands 
we pay commissions to our third party partners based on the revenue generated by their websites 
we continue to pursue the expansion of our private label channel through the addition of new partners 
for example  in the third quarter of  we launched a partnership with american express to provide a variety of private label solutions for air  car  hotel and vacation packages for the american express consumer travel network 
partner marketing the partner marketing team is responsible for building innovative online marketing and advertising partnerships across our global portfolio of leading consumer and business travel brands 
we generate advertising revenue by providing our partners access to our customer base through a combination of display advertising  performance based advertising  video production and other marketing programs 
travel companies  convention and visitor bureaus  credit card partners  media  packaged goods and other non travel advertisers all advertise on our websites 
merchant and retail models we generate revenue primarily from the booking of travel products and services on our websites 
we provide customers the ability to book travel products and services on both a standalone basis and as part of a vacation package  primarily through our merchant and retail business models 
merchant model our merchant model provides customers the ability to book air travel  hotels  car rentals  destination services and vacation packages 
hotel transactions comprise the majority of our merchant bookings 
we generate revenue for our services based on the difference between the total amount the customer pays for the travel product and the negotiated net rate plus estimated taxes that the supplier charges us for that product 
we may  depending upon the brand and the product  earn revenue by charging our customers a service fee for booking their travel reservation 
generally  our net revenue per transaction is higher under the merchant model compared with the retail model 
customers generally pay us for reservations at the time of booking  and we pay our suppliers at a later date  which is generally when the customer uses the reservation  although in the case of merchant air payment often occurs prior to the consumption date 
initially  we record these customer receipts as accrued merchant payables and either deferred income or net revenue  depending on the travel product 
the timing difference between when the cash is collected from our customers and when payments are made to our suppliers increases our operating cash flow and represents a source of liquidity for us 
we recognize net revenue under the merchant model when we have no further obligations to the customer 
for merchant air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for merchant hotel transactions and merchant car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up  respectively 
the timing of revenue recognition is different for merchant air travel because our primary service to the customer is fulfilled at the time of booking 
in the merchant model  we do not take on credit risk with the customer  however we are subject to charge backs and fraud risk  which we actively monitor  we have the ability to determine the price  we are not responsible for the actual delivery of the flight  hotel room or car rental  
table of contents we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer chooses the supplier 
when customers assemble vacation packages  we may offer the customer the ability to book a combination of travel products that use both the merchant model and the retail model 
vacation packages allow us to make products available to our customers at prices that are generally lower than booking each travel product separately 
retail model our retail model provides customers the ability to book air travel  hotels  car rentals and cruises 
air transactions comprise the majority of our retail bookings 
under the retail model  we earn commissions from suppliers for airline tickets  hotel rooms  car rentals and other travel products and services booked on our websites 
we generally receive these commissions from suppliers after the customer uses the travel reservation 
we may  depending upon the brand and the product  earn revenue by charging customers a service fee for booking their travel reservation 
generally  our net revenue per transaction is lower under the retail model compared with the merchant model 
however  airline tickets booked under the retail model contribute substantially to our overall gross bookings and net revenue due to the high volume of airline tickets booked on our websites 
we recognize net revenue under the retail model when the reservation is made  secured by a customer with a credit card  and we have no further obligations to the customer 
for air transactions  this is at the time of booking 
for hotel transactions and car transactions  net revenue is recognized at the time of check in or customer pick up respectively  net of an allowance for cancelled reservations 
in the retail model  we do not take on credit risk with the customer  we are not the primary obligor with the customer  we have no latitude in determining pricing  we take no inventory risk  we have no ability to determine or change the products or services delivered  and the customer chooses the supplier 
supplier relationships and global distribution systems supplier relationships we work with our suppliers to provide our customers with a broad and deep range of highly competitive travel products and services on our websites 
we have teams that manage relationships and negotiate agreements with our suppliers 
these agreements generally cover access to the supplier travel inventory as well as payment for our services 
our teams cover air  hotel  car rental  cruise  travel insurance and destination services suppliers 
our teams focus on managing relationships  obtaining supplier sponsored promotions and negotiating contracts 
for hotels  we are focused on offering our customers the ability to book the most relevant hotels at the most competitive prices 
to do this  we are focused on improving our infrastructure to ensure we have appropriate connectivity with our suppliers  sophisticated sort order algorithms and robust promotional capabilities 
we have a global hotel services team that works closely with chains and independent hotels to increase the number of properties that participate on our websites and works with hotels to ensure that our customers have access to their best available prices  including prices exclusive to our brands  where possible 
for airlines  we have long standing and  we believe  generally good relationships with our suppliers 
we intend to continue to work with our suppliers to provide our customers with a highly competitive product offering 
over the course of we put in place multi year marketing and distribution agreements with three of our four largest airline partners in the us our suppliers continue to look for ways to decrease their overall distribution costs  which could significantly reduce the net revenue otcs earn from travel and other travel related products 
we have encountered  and expect to continue to encounter  pressure on supplier economics 
as a result  the revenue we and other otcs earn in the form of incentive payments from gdss or in the form of mark ups and commissions from our suppliers is likely to be impacted over the long term as supplier contracts are extended 

table of contents global distribution systems global distribution systems gdss provide us access to a comprehensive set of supplier content through a single source 
suppliers  such as airlines and hotels  utilize gdss to connect their product and service offerings with travel providers  who in turn make these products and services available to travelers for booking 
certain of our businesses utilize gds services provided by galileo  worldspan and amadeus it group amadeus 
under our gds service agreements  we receive revenue in the form of an incentive payment for air  car and hotel segments that are processed through a gds 
these gds service agreements contain volume requirements for the number of segments we must process and require us to make shortfall payments if we do not process the required minimum number of segments for a given year 
as a result  a significant portion of our gds services are processed by these providers 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of incentive revenue from gds providers  which accounted for more than of our net revenue 
operations and technology systems infrastructure and web and database servers we use savvis co location services in the united states to host our systems infrastructure and web and database servers for orbitz  cheaptickets  the away network  orbitz for business and ebookers 
the majority of our hardware and other equipment is located at the savvis facility 
savvis provides data center management services as well as emergency hands on support 
in addition  we have our own dedicated staff on site at the facility 
if savvis was unable  for any reason  to support our primary web hosting facility  we have a secondary facility through verizon business  which is also located in the united states 
we use global switch services in the united kingdom to host our systems infrastructure and web and database servers for ebookers legacy systems and for hotelclub 
the arrangement with global switch is similar to the arrangement described above with savvis 
systems platform our systems platform enables us to deconstruct the segment feeds from our gds partners for air flight searches and then reassemble these segments for cost effective and flexible multi leg itineraries 
we also have the ability to connect to and book air travel directly on certain airlines internal reservation systems through our supplier link technology 
our easy to use matrix display allows customers to simultaneously view these various travel options so that they can select the price and supplier that best meet their travel needs 
in addition  our vacation packaging technology enables travelers to view multiple combinations of airlines  hotels and other travel products and allows them to assemble a customized vacation package that is generally less expensive than booking each travel product separately 
we have technology operations teams dedicated to ensuring that our websites operate efficiently 
these teams monitor our websites as well as the performance and availability of our third party service providers and coordinate releases of new functionality on our websites 
we have product development teams focused on creating new and enhancing existing website functionality 
these teams also developed and implemented our global technology platform that supports our global consumer brands  in february  we completed our global technology platform migration  a multi year initiative to bring all of our consumer brands onto a common technology platform 
customer support our customer support platform includes customer self service  chat  email and call center services to provide our customers with multiple options to enhance the travel experience 
we utilize intelligent voice routing and intelligent call management technology to connect customers with the appropriate agent who can best assist them with their particular needs 
we utilize third party vendors domestically and internationally to manage these call centers and customer service centers 
fraud prevention system we have an internally developed fraud prevention system that we believe enables us to efficiently detect fraudulent bookings 
the system automates many functions and prioritizes suspicious transactions for review by fraud analysts within our fraud prevention team 

table of contents marketing we utilize a combination of online and traditional offline marketing 
our sales and marketing efforts primarily focus on increasing brand awareness and driving visitors to our websites 
our long term success will depend on our ability to continue to increase the overall number of booked transactions in a cost effective manner 
we use various forms of online marketing to drive traffic to our websites including search engine marketing sem  travel research websites  meta search travel websites  display advertising  affiliate programs and email marketing 
we continue to pursue strategies to improve our online marketing efficiency 
these strategies include increasing the amount of traffic coming to our websites through search engine optimization seo and customer relationship management crm and improving the efficiency of our sem and travel research spending 
we also use traditional broadcast advertising to focus on brand differentiation and to emphasize distinct features of our businesses that we believe are valuable to our customers 
we have dedicated marketing teams that focus on generating leads and building relationships with corporate travel managers and potential private label partners 
our orbitz for business sales team includes experienced corporate travel managers who are qualified to assist organizations in choosing between the variety of corporate booking products that we offer 
intellectual property we regard our technology and other intellectual property  including our brands  as a critical part of our business 
we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of copyright  trademark and patent laws and trade secret and confidentiality procedures 
we have a number of trademarks  service marks and trade names that are registered or for which we have pending registration applications or common law rights 
we currently hold numerous issued united states patents and pending united states patent applications 
we file additional patent applications on new inventions  as appropriate 
despite these efforts and precautions  we cannot be certain that any of these patent applications will result in issued patents  or that we will receive any effective protection from competition from any trademarks and issued patents 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization 
in that case  legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by unauthorized use 
further  others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties 
from time to time  we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks  copyrights  patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  we may have to initiate lawsuits in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others 
any such litigation  regardless of outcome or merit  could consume a significant amount of financial resources or management time 
it could also invalidate or impair our intellectual property rights  or result in significant damages or onerous license terms and restrictions for us 
we may even lose our right to use certain intellectual property or business processes 
these outcomes could materially harm our business 
see item  legal proceedings 
at the time of the ipo  we entered into a master license agreement with travelport  which grants travelport licenses to use certain of our intellectual property going forward  including our supplier link technology  portions of ebookers booking  search and vacation packaging technologies  certain of our products and online booking tools for corporate travel  portions of our private label vacation packaging technology  and our extranet supplier connectivity functionality 
the master license agreement granted us the right to use a corporate online booking product developed by travelport 
we have entered into a value added reseller license with travelport for this product 
the master license agreement generally includes the right to create derivative works and other improvements 
other than the unrestricted use of our supplier link technology  travelport is generally prohibited from sublicensing these technologies to any third party for competitive use 
however  travelport and its affiliates are not restricted from using the technologies to compete directly with us 

table of contents information about segments and geographic areas we operate and manage our business as a single operating segment 
for geographic related information  see note segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
industry conditions general the worldwide travel industry is a large and dynamic industry that has been characterized by rapid and significant change 
we compete in various geographic markets  with our primary markets being the united states  europe and asia pacific 
we are one of the market leaders within the united states  which is the most mature of the global travel markets 
internationally  a relatively low percentage of travel sales are transacted online and the market is highly fragmented  which presents a significant growth opportunity for us and our competitors 
in europe  we have meaningfully improved our scale  and we are well positioned to aggressively compete 
the asia pacific market  as well as other emerging markets  where online penetration rates are particularly low and the competition is not as entrenched  is an area of focus for us 
competition the general market for travel products and services is highly competitive  and the competitive intensity is increasing 
the online travel industry generally has low barriers to entry and competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost 
our competition includes online and offline travel companies  travel suppliers  many of which have their own branded websites and call centers  travel research companies  search engines  and meta search websites 
our competition may offer more favorable terms and or improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers 
travel suppliers have increasingly focused on distributing their products through their own websites in lieu of using third parties 
suppliers who sell on their own websites offer advantages such as their own bonus miles or loyalty points  which may make their offerings more attractive than our offerings to some consumers 
travel research companies  search engines and meta search websites are capable of sending customers to the websites of suppliers and our direct competitors 
factors affecting our competitive success include price  availability of travel products  ability to package travel products across multiple suppliers  brand recognition  customer service and customer care  fees charged to customers  ease of use  accessibility  reliability and innovation 
seasonality our businesses experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
the majority of our customers book leisure travel rather than business travel 
gross bookings for leisure travel are generally highest in the first half of the year as customers plan and book their spring and summer vacations 
however  net revenue generated under the merchant model is generally recognized when the travel takes place and typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer 
as a result  our cash receipts are generally highest in the first half of the year and our net revenue is typically highest in the second and third calendar quarters 
our seasonality may also be affected by fluctuations in the travel products our suppliers make available to us for booking  the growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix 
company strategy we take advantage of our deep roots in technology and innovation to offer consumers the premier way to book online travel  whether via personal computer  tablet or smartphone 
we completed the migration of our global consumer brands to one common technology platform in we believe the global platform is the cornerstone of our ability to rapidly and efficiently innovate and expand into new markets with new products and services 
our strategic efforts are focused on growing our hotel and international businesses as a complement to our historic strength in air 
the hotel marketplace is approximately billion and continues to have relatively low online penetration rates  in particular internationally 
we believe this presents us with an opportunity to significantly expand our business by leveraging our global platform  brand strength  marketing capabilities and global hotel sourcing network 
we expect key drivers of our future growth will include expansion into new international markets  investments in mobile  marketing optimization and site optimization  the upcoming launch of an orbitz 
com loyalty program  and new partner customer additions within our distribution group and orbitz for business 

table of contents we are focused on expanding our international presence through both product innovation and new market expansion 
for example  in february  we launched the ebookers rail product  becoming the first otc to offer booking functionality for the uk domestic rail network 
we expect our hotelclub brand will play a significant role in new market expansion 
room night growth rates at hotelclub have improved substantially in the second half of and into we believe hotelclub hotel only offering with a strong loyalty component represents an extensible model that can allow low cost new market entry  allowing us to rapidly expand our footprint into new and fast growing regions 
orbitz worldwide is a recognized leader in the rapidly growing mobile channel 
this is a core part of our strategy to drive growth across all of our global brands 
for example  in december  approximately of orbitz 
com stand alone hotel bookings came via a mobile device 
in the edition of the internet retailer mobile released in october  orbitz 
com was the highest ranked travel company  positioned overall behind only amazon  apple and marriott vs 
in the prior year 
in december the orbitz app for iphone was one of apps inducted into apple app store hall of fame  making it one of only iphone apps ever to receive such recognition  out of over  in the app store 
by virtue of the common technology platform shared by all of the company consumer brands  the benefits of the company mobile investments are available to the ebookers  hotelclub and cheaptickets brands 
we will continue to build on our strengths in mobile to drive growth across all of our global brands and product offerings 
we continue to focus on marketing optimization and site optimization to drive consumers to our websites in a cost effective manner and maximize our ability to achieve conversion of visitors into customers 
we achieve this through a number of means  including our investments in algorithmic bidding  landing pages  search engine optimization and testing 
we believe that well architected loyalty offerings have significant potential to enhance the financial performance of our consumer brands 
hotelclub already has a well established loyalty program which helps drive repeat transactions 
we plan to launch a loyalty program for our orbitz 
com brand in phases over the course of we believe the orbitz 
com loyalty program will enhance the orbitz 
com consumer value proposition and strengthen our ongoing relationship with our customers 
we expect the orbitz 
com loyalty program will be a driver of long term room night growth through its impact on driving repeat and cross sell purchases 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees  more than half of whom were based in the united states and the remaining were based primarily in australia and the united kingdom 
we believe we have a good relationship with our employees 
we outsource some of our technology support  development  customer service and administrative functions to third parties 
additionally  we utilize independent contractors to supplement our workforce 
iran sanctions related disclosure under the iran threat reduction and syrian human rights act of  which added section r of the exchange act  we are required to include certain disclosures in our periodic reports if we or any of our affiliates knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during the period covered by the report

trw disclosure compliance with government regulations 
table of contents pursuant to section r d iii of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  we note that in certain of our non us subsidiaries sold products to customers that could be affiliated with  or deemed to be acting on behalf of  the industrial development and renovation organization  which has been designated as an agency of the government of iran 
gross revenue attributable to such sales was approximately  and net profit from such sales was approximately  although these activities were not prohibited by us law at the time they were conducted  our subsidiaries have discontinued their dealings with such customers  other than limited wind down activities which are permissible  and we do not otherwise intend to continue or enter into any iran related activity 
we were also notified that travelport  which controls us and is therefore an affiliate of ours as each term is interpreted by the sec for purposes of section r of the exchange act  provided the disclosure reproduced below

item a 
risk factors travelport and its controlling holders control us and may have strategic interests that differ from ours or the interests of our other stockholders 
currently  travelport and investment funds that own or control travelport ultimate parent company beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock and therefore indirectly control us 
moreover  our certificate of incorporation provides that travelport has a variety of rights  including the right to approve all nominees for our board of 
table of contents directors 
travelport and its controlling holders own sufficient shares to determine the outcome of any actions requiring the approval of our stockholders  including adopting most amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approving or rejecting proposed mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
the interests of travelport controlling holders may differ from those of our public stockholders in material respects 
travelport controlling holders and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and maximizing the return on those investments 
they currently have  and may from time to time in the future acquire  interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or our suppliers or customers or firms with which we do business  such as the travelport gdss 
in addition  travelport interests may differ from ours particularly in the context of our respective arrangements with suppliers 
during the term of our current gds service agreement with travelport the travelport gds service agreement  which ends december   we are limited in our ability to utilize alternative gds options or direct connections with suppliers 
if travelport alters its commercial relationships with a supplier that is also a suppliers of ours  these actions could make us a less attractive distribution channel to that supplier  who could attempt to terminate or renegotiate its agreements with us  potentially placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other otcs 
see we are dependent on travelport for our gds services below 
in addition  travelport suppliers  many of which are also major suppliers to us  may seek to exert commercial leverage over us in an effort to obtain concessions from travelport  which could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and adversely affect our business and operating results 
in recognition of the fact that travelport interests may differ from ours  our audit committee  in accordance with applicable listing and regulatory requirements and principles of good corporate governance  takes an active role in reviewing and approving any agreement involving more than  of payments or receipts in which travelport or any other related party has an interest such as any renewal or replacement of the travelport gds service agreement 
as a practical matter  travelport and its controlling holders will be able to exert significant influence and even control over matters put to a vote of our stockholders so long as they continue to indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding voting stock  even if that amount is less than 
actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between our management and directors as well as the management and directors of travelport 
jeff clarke serves as chairman of our board of directors and is the chairman of the travelport board of directors 
martin j 
brand  who is a managing director at the blackstone group  currently serves on the board of directors of travelport and serves on our board of directors 
the fact that mr 
clarke and mr 
brand hold positions with travelport and us could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when they face decisions that may affect two or more of these entities 
in addition  jill a 
greenthal and robert l 
friedman  who are senior advisors in the private equity group of the blackstone group  currently serve on our board of directors 
affiliates of the blackstone group exercise control over travelport ultimate parent company and therefore  the fact that ms 
greenthal and mr 
friedman hold positions with the blackstone group could create  or appear to create  a potential conflict of interest when either of them face decisions that affect both travelport and us 
further  our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of travelport who is also an officer or director of ours may be liable to us or our stockholders for a breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to travelport instead of us or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to us because the officer or director has directed the corporate opportunity to travelport 
these provisions may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between travelport and us because the provisions effectively shield an overlapping director executive 
potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between travelport and us regarding the terms of commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates 
potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we enter into any other commercial arrangements with travelport in the future 
our certificate of incorporation limits our ability to engage in many transactions without the consent of travelport 
our certificate of incorporation provides travelport with a greater degree of control and influence in the operation of our business and the management of our affairs than is typically available to a stockholder of a publicly traded company 
until travelport ceases to beneficially own shares entitled to or more of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our then outstanding common stock  the prior consent of travelport is required for the following matters 
table of contents any consolidation or merger of us or any of our subsidiaries with any person  other than a subsidiary  any sale  lease  exchange or other disposition or any acquisition or investment  other than certain permitted investments  by us  other than transactions between us and our subsidiaries  or any series of related dispositions or acquisitions  except for those for which we give travelport at least days prior written notice and which involve consideration not in excess of million in fair market value  except any disposition of cash equivalents or investment grade securities or obsolete or worn out equipment and the lease  assignment or sublease of any real or personal property  in each case  in the ordinary course of business  any change in our authorized capital stock or our creation of any class or series of capital stock  the issuance or sale by us or one of our subsidiaries of any equity securities or equity derivative securities or the adoption of any equity incentive plan  except for the issuance of equity securities by us or one of our subsidiaries to travelport or to another restricted subsidiary of travelport and the issuance by us of equity securities under our equity incentive plans in an amount not to exceed million per year in fair market value  the amendment of various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  the declaration of dividends on any class of our capital stock  the authorization of any series of preferred stock  the creation  incurrence  assumption or guaranty by us or any of our subsidiaries of any indebtedness for borrowed money  except for up to million of indebtedness at any one time outstanding under our credit agreement and up to million of other indebtedness so long as we give travelport at least days prior written notice of the incurrence thereof  the creation  existence or effectiveness of any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction by us or any of our subsidiaries on payment of dividends or other distributions  payment of indebtedness  the making of loans or advances and the sale  lease or transfer of any properties or assets  in each case  to travelport or any of its restricted subsidiaries  any change in the number of directors on our board of directors  the establishment of any committee of the board  the determination of the members of the board or any committee of the board  and the filling of newly created memberships and vacancies on the board or any committee of the board  and any transactions with affiliates of travelport involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of million  except transactions between or among travelport or any of its restricted subsidiaries  including us  the payment of reasonable and customary fees paid to  and indemnities provided for the benefit of  officers  directors  employees or consultants of travelport  any of its direct or indirect parent companies or any of its restricted subsidiaries  including us  any agreement as in effect on the date of the consummation of this offering  and investments by the blackstone group and certain of its affiliates in our or our subsidiaries securities so long as i the investment is being offered generally to other investors on the same or more favorable terms and ii the investment constitutes less than of the proposed or outstanding issue amount of such class of securities 
these restrictions could prevent us from being able to pursue transactions or relationships that would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
these restrictions could also limit stockholder value by preventing a change of control that our stockholders might consider favorable 
we are dependent on travelport for our gds services 
to varying extents  travel suppliers use gdss to connect their products and services with travel companies  who in turn make these products and services available to travelers for booking 
under the travelport gds service agreement  which expires december   we are required  subject to certain exceptions  to utilize galileo and worldspan  which are subsidiaries of travelport  for a significant portion of our gds services 
in addition  our contractual obligations to travelport for gds services limit our ability to use alternative gds options before the agreement expires at the end of next year 
as a result  if travelport became unwilling or was unable to provide these services to us  we may not be able to transition to alternative providers in a timely or efficient manner  and our business could be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  our travelport gds service agreement restricts our ability to use direct connection relationships with suppliers during the term of the agreement  although there are certain exceptions 
if we pursue a direct connect relationship during the term of our travelport gds service agreement and travelport disputes our ability to do so  we may become involved in a potentially costly and uncertain litigation dispute with travelport 
these contractual obligations may reduce our flexibility to implement changes to our business in response to changing economic conditions  industry trends  or technological developments 
as a result  the limitations imposed by the gds service agreement could place us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively impact our business and operating results 

table of contents we rely on travelport to issue letters of credit on our behalf under its credit facility 
as of december   there were million of outstanding letters of credit issued by travelport on our behalf 
under the separation agreement between travelport and us dated as of july   as amended  the separation agreement  travelport has agreed to issue us dollar denominated letters of credit on our behalf in an aggregate amount not to exceed million so long as travelport and its affiliates as defined therein own at least of our voting stock 
in the event travelport is no longer obligated or is unable to issue letters of credit on our behalf  we would be required to establish additional cash reserves  which could significantly reduce our liquidity and cash available to grow our business 
we currently have a revolving credit facility  which matures in july and under which we have million of outstanding letters of credit as of december   and a million letter of credit facility  which terminates in september and under which we have million of outstanding letters of credit as of december  the million letter of credit facility requires us to hold in a collateral account through an unrestricted subsidiary cash equal to times the outstanding letters of credit amount plus fees 
we have granted travelport perpetual licenses to use certain of our intellectual property  which could facilitate travelport ability to compete with us 
we are party to a master license agreement with travelport under which we and travelport each have rights to use certain of the other intellectual property 
the master license agreement permits travelport and its affiliates to use and  in some cases  to sublicense to third parties certain of our intellectual property  including our supplier link technology  portions of ebookers booking  search and vacation package technologies  certain of our products and online booking tools for corporate travel  portions of our private label vacation package technology  and our extranet supplier connectivity functionality 
travelport and its affiliates may use these technologies as part of  or in support of  their own products or services  including in some cases to directly compete with us 
the master license agreement permits travelport to sublicense our intellectual property other than our supplier link technology to a party that is not an affiliate of travelport  except that travelport may not sublicense our intellectual property to a third party for a use that competes with our business  unless travelport incorporates or uses our intellectual property with travelport products or services to enhance or improve travelport products or services other than to provide our intellectual property to third parties on a standalone basis 
travelport and its affiliates are permitted to use our intellectual property to provide their own products and services to third parties that compete with us 
with respect to our supplier link technology  travelport has an unrestricted license 
these travelport rights could facilitate travelport  its affiliates and third parties ability to compete with us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on our supplier and partner relationships and adverse changes in these relationships or our inability to enter into new relationships could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and reduce our revenue 
we rely significantly on our relationships with hotels  airlines and other suppliers and travel partners 
we enter into agreements with these suppliers and travel partners at varying times and the agreements are of varying duration 
as a result  at any given point in time  one or more of these agreements may be approaching expiration or renewal 
moreover  in order to enhance the competitiveness of our offerings  we are constantly seeking to add new suppliers and travel partners 
adverse changes in any of these relationships whether upon expiration or otherwise  or the inability to enter into new relationships  could adversely affect our revenue and could also negatively impact the availability and competitiveness of travel products offered on our websites 
the significant reduction by any of our major suppliers or travel partners in their business with our companies for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal of doing business with us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
globally  airlines continue to look for ways to decrease their overall costs  including the cost of distributing airline tickets through otcs and gdss  and to increase their control over distribution 
the airlines have negotiated  and we expect they will continue to attempt to negotiate  terms more favorable to themselves from time to time when the opportunity presents itself  such as upon expiration of an agreement 
if airlines are successful in obtaining more favorable terms in their agreements with us  or in the agreements between the airlines and the gdss including travelport  or an airline actually terminates an 
table of contents agreement with us or travelport  the net revenue we earn from the distribution of airline tickets would be negatively impacted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
for example  in late  we and american airlines aa were unable to agree to terms under which aa tickets would be marketed and distributed to our customers and thus the offering of aa tickets on the orbitz 
com and orbitz for business websites was discontinued 
after a hiatus of several months  we resumed offering aa tickets on our sites and have continued to do so pursuant to a series of agreements between us and aa that ran through january  since that date  we have continued to market and distribute aa tickets on our websites  but if we cannot reach another formal agreement with aa  the offering of aa tickets to our customers might cease again 
if that were to occur  or if a similar situation were to occur with other airlines  it could reduce our access to air inventory  thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other otcs and reduce our revenues 
the parent of aa has recently announced its intention to merge with us airways group  inc to effect a business combination of american airlines and us airways 
in  we signed a multi year agreement with us airways 
we cannot predict what the effect of such a merger will be on our ongoing relationship with american airlines or us airways 
in addition  in april  aa filed a lawsuit against travelport and us alleging that our travelport gds service agreement violates the sherman antitrust act 
although the court has dismissed this claim with prejudice  there are several other claims pending against travelport and orbitz 
it is possible that the outcome of these claims could influence the manner in which gdss operate  which could have significant implications for both airlines and otcs 
we are also subject to minimum segment volume thresholds and may be subject to shortfall payments to travelport if we fail to process a certain percentage of segments through its gdss 
these minimum segment volume thresholds may limit our ability to enter into  or expand  relationships with other partners  which could negatively affect our access to travel offerings and reduce our revenue 
our business is dependent on our liquidity and our ability to access funding 
if we are unable to refinance or extend our revolving credit facility or we are unable to refinance or repay our term loan by its july maturity date  we cannot be certain that other debt financing would be available to us or be available on attractive or acceptable terms 
if such debt financing is not available to us or not available on attractive or acceptable terms  we may need to dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds 
such an issuance of equity could be materially dilutive to existing stockholders 
we do not know whether we will be able to take any of these actions  if necessary  on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
in the event that funding for the term loan is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  or we are unable to refinance or extend our revolving credit facility by its july maturity  we may be unable to take advantage of potential business opportunities  respond to competitive pressures  or to operate our business as it currently exists  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity and the value of our common stock 
in addition  our liquidity could be negatively impacted in the future if any of the following events occur travelport is no longer obligated or is unable to issue letters of credit on our behalf  termination of a major supplier participation on our websites  decline in merchant gross bookings due to deteriorating economic conditions or other factors  decline in standalone hotel merchant gross bookings due to a shift from the merchant model to the retail model  changes to payment terms or other requirements imposed by vendors  suppliers or regulatory agencies  such as requiring us to provide letters of credit  cash reserves or other forms of financial security or increases in such requirements  lower than anticipated operating cash flows  or other unanticipated events  such as unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings  including in the case of hotel occupancy proceedings  certain jurisdictions requirements that we provide financial security or pay an assessment to the municipality in order to challenge the assessment in court 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which could limit the manner in which we operate our business 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement 
our substantial level of indebtedness could impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  
table of contents reduce the funds available to us for purposes such as potential acquisitions and capital expenditures because we are required to use a portion of our cash flows from operations to make debt service payments  put us at a competitive disadvantage because we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in the economy or our industry  including increased competition  and make us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and not to exceed a maximum total leverage ratio 
if we fail to comply with these covenants and we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  our lenders could accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility and could proceed against the collateral securing this indebtedness 
if this were to occur  there is no assurance that alternative financing would be available to us or at favorable terms 
in addition  restrictive covenants in our credit agreement specifically limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or enter into guarantees  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make new investments  loans or acquisitions  grant or incur liens on our assets  sell our assets  engage in mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  engage in transactions with affiliates  and make restricted payments 
as a result  we may operate our business differently than if we were not subject to these covenants and restrictions 
our revenue is derived from the travel industry and prolonged substantial decreases in travel volume  particularly air travel  as well as other industry trends  have historically adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenue is derived from the worldwide travel industry 
as a result  our revenue is directly related to the overall level of travel activity  particularly air travel and hotel volume  and is therefore significantly impacted by declines in or disruptions to travel in the united states  europe and the asia pacific region due to factors entirely outside of our control 
for example  the deterioration of the capital markets and related financial crisis in the second half of negatively impacted consumer spending patterns  including spending on travel  thereby reducing demand for our products and decreasing our revenue 
while we have seen improvements in the economy in recent years  economic conditions remain unstable 
if economic conditions do not continue to improve  or worsen  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
additional factors that affect our revenue include global security issues  political instability  acts or threats of terrorism  hostilities or war and other political issues that could adversely affect travel volume in our key regions  epidemics or pandemics  natural disasters  such as hurricanes  volcanic eruptions and earthquakes  the financial condition of suppliers  including the airline and hotel industry  and the impact of their financial condition on the cost and availability of air travel and hotel rooms  changes in airline distribution policies  changes to regulations governing the airline and travel industry  an increase in fuel prices affecting travel  work stoppages or labor unrest at any of the major airlines or airports  increased airport security that could reduce the convenience of air travel  travelers perceptions of the occurrence of travel related accidents or the scope  severity and timing of the other factors described above  and changes in occupancy and room rates achieved by hotels 

table of contents if there is a prolonged substantial decrease in travel volumes  particularly for air travel and hotel stays  for these or any other reasons  it would have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if one or more of our major suppliers  including airlines and car rental companies  suffers a deterioration in its financial condition or it restructures its operations 
in the past several years  several major airlines have filed for bankruptcy protection  recently exited bankruptcy  or discussed publicly the risks of bankruptcy 
in addition  some of these airlines and others have merged  or discussed merging  with other airlines 
in addition  the economic downturn severely impacted the automobile industry  including car rental companies 
we depend on a relatively small number of airlines for a significant portion of our net revenue 
our car net revenue is also generated from a relatively small number of car rental companies 
as a result of this dependence  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if the financial condition of one or more of the major airlines or car rental companies were to deteriorate or in the event of supplier consolidation in either of these industries 
for example  further consolidation of one or more of the major airlines  such as the announced merger of american airlines and us airways could result in further capacity reductions  a reduction in the number of airline tickets available for booking on our website and increased air fares  which may have a negative impact on demand for travel products 
the travel industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to effectively compete in the future 
we operate in the highly competitive travel industry 
our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to compete effectively against numerous competitors  including other online travel companies  traditional offline travel companies  suppliers  travel research companies  search engines and meta search companies  several of which have significantly greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we have  as discussed below 
factors affecting our competitive success include price  availability of travel products  ability to package travel products across multiple suppliers  brand recognition  customer service and customer care  fees charged to customers  ease of use  accessibility  reliability and innovation 
if we are not able to compete effectively against our competitors  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
online travel agencies we face significant competition from other online travel agencies  such as priceline  expedia  travelocity  and their related brands  as well as other regional competitors such as ctrip in china 
we also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and the acquisition and retention of supply 
travel suppliers suppliers have increasingly focused on distributing their products through their own websites 
for example  some low cost airlines  which are having increasing success in the marketplace  distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites  and several large hotel chains have combined to establish a single online hotel search platform  with links directly to their own websites 
delta air lines  inc in recent years eliminated sales of airline tickets through several third party distributors  limited forward distribution of its fares to meta search providers such as kayak  and limited the extent to which certain fare classes may be used in the construction of multi carrier itineraries  all in an attempt to drive customers to book directly on its website 
suppliers may offer advantages for customers to book directly  such as member only fares  bonus miles or loyalty points  which could make their offerings more attractive to customers 
in response to these pressures in the past  we and other online travel companies reduced or eliminated domestic booking fees on retail airline tickets and hotel stays and removed certain change and cancellation fees 
our results of operations could be negatively affected if competitive dynamics in the industry caused us to reduce further or to eliminate the service fees we charge our customers 
search engines we also face increasing competition from search engines like google  bing and yahoo search 
search engines have grown in popularity and may offer comprehensive travel planning or shopping capabilities  which may drive more traffic directly to the websites of suppliers or competitors 
google appears to have increased its focus on appealing to travel customers through its launch of google places and google flights  an air travel specific website that promotes air suppliers sites and not those of otcs 
in addition  google efforts around google places could lead to it favoring google places or a favored partner over and above our pages  which could undermine our ability to obtain prominent placement in paid or unpaid search results at a reasonable cost  or at all 
in addition  we currently license our search functionality  qpx software  from ita software  inc  a subsidiary of google 
google ownership of ita could result in its developing new software or other products in the future that it may not make available to us  which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
travel meta search engines and content aggregators travel meta search websites  including kayak 
com which entered into a merger agreement with priceline 
com in november and trivago 
com in which expedia has agreed to acquire a majority ownership interest  and travel research sites that have search functionality  such as tripadvisor  aggregate travel search results for a specific itinerary across supplier  travel agent and other websites 
if these competitors limit our participation within their results  it could affect our traffic generating arrangements in a negative manner 
in addition  some meta search 
table of contents sites  such as kayak 
com  offer users the ability to make hotel reservations directly on their websites  which may reduce the amount of traffic and transactions available to us through referrals from these sites 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against any current  emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge  or provide differentiated products and services to our customer base 
increasing competition from current and emerging competitors  the introduction of new technologies and the continued expansion of existing technologies  such as meta search and other search engine technologies  may force us to make changes to our business models  which could affect our financial performance and liquidity 
increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins  as well as loss of customer  transactions and brand recognition 
we rely on search engines and content providers  who may change their business models in ways that could have a negative impact on our business 
we use google and other internet search engines to generate traffic to our websites  principally through the purchase of travel related keywords 
google and other search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user search 
these changes could negatively affect the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites 
in addition  a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in pay per click and display advertising campaigns on search engines  meta search sites and content properties 
pricing and operating dynamics for these traffic sources can experience rapid change  both technically and competitively 
moreover  any of these providers could  for competitive or other purposes  alter their search algorithms or results  causing our websites to place lower in search query results 
if a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking  paid or unpaid  of our websites or that of our third party distribution partners  or if competitive dynamics impact the costs or effectiveness of search engine optimization  search engine marketing or other traffic generating arrangements in a negative manner  our business and financial performance would be adversely affected  potentially to a material extent 
certain of our international subsidiaries have a history of significant operating losses  and our inability to improve their scale and profitability could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have historically incurred significant operating losses at our international subsidiaries and may continue to experience operating losses in the future  particularly since we expect to continue to incur high levels of marketing and other expenses in order to expand our international operations 
as a result  we have made  and may continue to make  significant investments in our international operations by using a portion of the cash flow generated from our domestic operations or making borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurance that our international subsidiaries will be profitable in the future or that any profits generated by them will be sufficient to recover our investments in them 
the profitability of our international subsidiaries depends to a large extent on the scale of their operations 
if we fail to achieve the desired scale  we may not be able to effectively compete in the global marketplace and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to additional risks not encountered when doing business in the united states  including foreign exchange risk  and our exposure to these risks will increase as we expand our international operations 
with employees in over countries outside the united states  we generated of our net revenue for the year ended december  from our international operations 
we are subject to certain risks as a result of having international operations and from having operations in multiple countries generally  including difficulties in staffing and managing operations due to distance  time zones  language and cultural differences  including issues associated with establishing management infrastructure in various countries  differences and unexpected changes in local regulatory requirements and exposure to local economic conditions  limits on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and increased risk of piracy  preference of local populations for local providers  restrictions on the repatriation of non us investments and earnings back to the united states  including withholding taxes imposed by certain foreign jurisdictions  diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights  and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to the extent we are not able to effectively mitigate or eliminate these risks  our results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents further  our international operations require us to comply with a number of us and international regulations  including  among others  the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures to ensure that our employees and agents comply with the fcpa and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we are dependent upon third party systems and service providers  and any disruption or adverse change in their businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we currently rely on certain third party computer systems  service providers and software companies  including the electronic central reservation systems and gdss of the airline  hotel and car rental industries 
in particular  our businesses rely on third parties to conduct searches for airfares  process hotel room transactions  process credit card payments  and provide computer infrastructure critical to our business 
in addition  we rely on a group of business process outsourcing companies located in various countries to provide us with call center and telesales services  back office administrative services such as ticketing fulfillment  hotel rate loading and quality control and information technology services  as well as financial services 
any interruption in these third party services could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  we currently utilize gdss  including worldspan  galileo and amadeus  to process a significant portion of our bookings  and any interruption or deterioration in our gds partners products or services could prevent us from searching and booking airline and car rental reservations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success is dependent on our ability to maintain relationships with our technology partners 
in the event our arrangements with any of these third parties are impaired or terminated  we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms  which could result in significant additional costs or disruptions to our business 
in addition  some of our agreements with third party service providers can be terminated by those parties on short notice and  in many cases  provide no recourse for service interruptions 
a termination of these services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness  and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business 
we depend upon the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems  including technologies and systems utilized for reservations  communications  procurement and administrative systems 
certain of our businesses also utilize third party fare search solutions and gdss or other technologies 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer our customers enhanced products  services  features and functionality  while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 
our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving industry standards while continuing to improve the performance  features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings and the changing demands of the marketplace 
in particular  expanding our systems and infrastructure to meet any potential increases in business volume will require us to commit additional financial  operational and technical resources before those increases materialize  with no assurance that they actually will 
furthermore  our use of this technology could be challenged by claims that we have infringed upon the patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain our existing systems  obtain new technologies and systems  or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost effective manner 
also  we may fail to achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system  or we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future 
if any of these events occur  our business could suffer 
system interruptions and the lack of redundancy may cause us to lose customers or business opportunities 
our inability to maintain and improve our information technology systems and infrastructure may result in system interruptions 
system interruptions and slow delivery times  unreliable service levels  prolonged or frequent service outages  or insufficient capacity may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers  which could result in our losing 
table of contents customers and revenue or incurring liabilities 
in addition to the risks associated with inadequate maintenance or upgrading  our information technologies and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various causes  including natural disasters  war and acts of terrorism  power losses  computer systems failure  internet and telecommunications or data network failures  operator error  losses and corruption of data  and similar events  computer viruses  penetration by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other physical or electronic breaches of security  and the failure of third party systems or services that we rely upon to maintain our own operations 
we do not have backup systems for certain critical aspects of our operations 
for example  if we were unable to connect to certain third party systems  such as gdss  due to failure of our systems  our ability to process bookings could be significantly or completely impaired 
many other systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient 
in addition  we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate for losses from a major interruption  and remediation may be costly and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
any extended interruption in our technologies or systems could significantly curtail our ability to conduct our businesses and generate revenue 
we are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes  which could harm us 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  including  but not limited to  actions relating to intellectual property  in particular patent infringement claims against us  tax matters  employment law and other negligence  breach of contract and fraud claims  that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations 
the defense of these actions may be both time consuming and expensive 
if any of these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
in addition  historically  our insurers have reimbursed us for a significant portion of costs we incurred to defend cases related to use or occupancy tax of hotel accommodations that some states and localities impose hotel occupancy tax 
we will not receive any additional insurance reimbursements in future periods as our insurance coverage has now been exhausted 
we may not be effectively protecting our intellectual property  which would allow competitors to duplicate our products and services 
this could make it more difficult for us to compete with them 
our success and ability to compete depend  in part  upon our technology and other intellectual property  including our brands 
among our significant assets are our software and other proprietary information and intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and patent laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect these assets 
however  we have a limited number of patents  and our software and related documentation are protected principally under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection  and the laws of some jurisdictions provide less protection for our proprietary rights than the laws of the united states 
we have granted travelport an exclusive license to our supplier link technology  including our patents related to that technology 
under the exclusive license  travelport has the first right to enforce those patents  and so we will only be able to bring actions to enforce those patents if travelport declines to do so 
unauthorized use and misuse of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  and the legal remedies available to us may not adequately compensate us for the damages caused by unauthorized use 
further  intellectual property challenges have been increasingly brought against members of the travel industry 
these legal actions have in the past  and might in the future  result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
in addition  we may need to take legal action in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  and these enforcement actions could result in the invalidation or other impairment of intellectual property rights we assert 
our business and financial performance could be negatively impacted by adverse tax events 
new sales  use  occupancy or other tax laws  statutes  rules  regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time 
such enactments could adversely affect our domestic and international business operations and our business and financial performance 
further  existing tax laws  statutes  rules  regulations or ordinances could be interpreted  changed  modified or applied adversely to us 
these events could require us to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis  as well as require us to pay fees  penalties and or interest for past amounts deemed to be due 
in addition  our revenue may decline because we may have to charge more for our products and services 

table of contents we are subject to a us federal income tax examination for the tax year 
while we believe that our tax provisions are appropriate  there is no assurance that the result of this or any future tax examinations would not result in additional amounts being due to taxing authorities 
new  changed  modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could also increase our compliance  operating and other costs  as well as the costs of our products or services 
further  these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business 
any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance 
we and other providers of travel in the online travel industry are currently subject to various lawsuits related to hotel occupancy tax in numerous jurisdictions in the united states  and other jurisdictions may be considering similar lawsuits 
an adverse ruling in the existing hotel occupancy tax cases could require us to pay tax retroactively and prospectively  and possibly penalties  interest and or fees 
we have also been contacted by several municipalities or other taxing bodies concerning our possible obligation with respect to local hotel occupancy or related taxes  and certain municipalities have begun audit proceedings and some have issued assessments against us 
if we are found to be subject to the hotel occupancy tax ordinance by a taxing authority and we appeal the decision in court  certain jurisdictions may attempt to require us to provide financial security or pay the assessment to the municipality in order to challenge the tax assessment in court 
the proliferation of new hotel occupancy tax cases or audit proceedings could result in substantial additional defense costs 
these events could also adversely impact our business and financial performance 
see item  legal proceedings 
our businesses are highly regulated  and any failure to comply with applicable regulations or any changes in those regulations could adversely affect us 
we operate in a highly regulated industry both in the united states and internationally 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or the enactment of new laws  rules and regulations applicable to us  which could decrease demand for our products and services  increase costs or subject us to additional liabilities 
moreover  regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations 
accordingly  these regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us if our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority 
our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  the various regulatory regimes to which we are subject may conflict so that compliance with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may create regulatory issues in another 
our business is subject to laws and regulations relating to our revenue generating and marketing activities  including those prohibiting unfair and deceptive advertising or practices 
our travel services are subject to regulation and laws governing the offer of travel products and services  including laws requiring us to register as a seller of travel in various jurisdictions and to comply with certain disclosure requirements 
as an otc that offers customers the ability to book air travel in the united states  we are also subject to regulation by the department of transportation  which has authority to enforce economic regulations and may assess civil penalties or challenge our operating authority 
our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and potential criminal violations 
any changes to these laws or regulations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our businesses and may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential in maintaining customer and supplier confidence in our services 
substantial or ongoing security breaches  whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based systems  could significantly harm our business 
we currently require customers to guarantee their transactions with their credit cards online 
we rely on licensed encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential customer information  including credit card numbers 
it is possible that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect customer transaction data 
we incur substantial expense to protect against and remedy security breaches and their consequences 
however  our security measures may not prevent security breaches 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing our remediation plan to address these potential exposures 
a party whether internal  external  an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations 
security breaches 
table of contents could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
security breaches could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security  which would have a negative effect on the demand for our products and services 
moreover  public perception concerning security and privacy on the internet could adversely affect customers willingness to use our websites 
a publicized breach of security  even if it only affects other companies conducting business over the internet  could inhibit the growth of the internet and  therefore  our services as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards as payment for transactions where we are the merchant of record and have established an allowance for such fraudulent purchases 
if we are unable to control the amount of fraudulent chargebacks for which we are liable  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our processing  storage  use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation  conflicting legal requirements  differing views of personal privacy rights or security breaches 
in the processing of customer transactions  we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information 
this information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world 
this legislation and regulation is generally intended to protect the privacy and security of personal information  including credit card information  that is collected  processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 
we could be adversely affected if domestic or international legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices  or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business 
travel companies have also been subjected to investigations  lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of passenger information 
as privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues  we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of travel data 
these and other privacy concerns  including security breaches  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to attract  train and retain executives and other qualified employees is critical to our results of operations and future growth 
we depend substantially on the continued services and performance of our key executives  senior management and skilled personnel  particularly our professionals with experience in our industry and our information technology and systems 
any of these individuals may choose to terminate their employment with us at any time 
the specialized skills we require can be difficult and time consuming to acquire and  as a result  these skills are often in short supply 
a significant period of time and expense may be required to hire and train replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart the company 
our inability to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by  for example  delaying our ability to bring new products and services to market or impairing the success of our operations or prospects for future growth

some of the cases are purported class actions  and most of the cases were brought simultaneously against other online travel companies  including expedia  travelocity and priceline 
the cases allege  among other things  that we violated the jurisdictions hotel occupancy tax ordinances  as well as related sales and use taxes 
while not identical in their allegations  the cases generally assert similar claims  including violations of local or state occupancy tax ordinances  failure to pay sales or use taxes  and in some cases  violations of consumer protection ordinances  conversion  unjust enrichment  imposition of a constructive trust  demand for a legal or equitable accounting  injunctive relief  declaratory judgment  and civil conspiracy 
the plaintiffs seek relief in a variety of forms  including declaratory judgment  full accounting of monies owed  imposition of a constructive trust  compensatory and punitive damages  disgorgement  restitution  interest  penalties and costs  attorneys fees  and where a class action has been claimed  an order certifying the action as a class action 
adverse rulings in these cases could require us to pay tax retroactively and prospectively and possibly pay interest  penalties  and fines
