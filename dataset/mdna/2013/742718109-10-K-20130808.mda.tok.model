md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
md a is organized in the following sections overview summary of results economic conditions  challenges and risks results of operations segment results cash flow  financial condition and liquidity significant accounting policies and estimates other information throughout md a  we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance  including unit volume growth  net sales and net earnings 
we also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  including organic sales growth  core earnings per share core eps  free cash flow and free cash flow productivity 
organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange  acquisitions and divestitures 
core eps is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges and gains 
free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending 
free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings 
we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends  as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management 
the explanation at the end of md a provides more details on the use and derivation of these measures

all such statements  except for historical and present factual information  are forward looking statements and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made  which may become out of date or incomplete 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or other factors 
forward looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations 
for more information on risks that could impact our results  refer to item a risk factors in this k 
ability to achieve business plans 
we are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products 
to achieve business goals  we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail the procter gamble company trade customers 
our continued success is dependent on leading edge innovation with respect to both products and operations  on the continued positive reputations of our brands and our ability to successfully maintain trademark protection 
this means we must be able to obtain patents and trademarks  and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition 
our success is also dependent on effective sales  advertising and marketing programs 
our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing net sales and volume profitably  especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets including developing markets in which we have chosen to focus 
there are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate 
to address these challenges  we must respond to competitive factors  including pricing  promotional incentives  trade terms and product initiatives 
we must manage each of these factors  as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers  in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans 
as a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands  our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition  divestiture and joint venture activities 
we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities  while at the same time delivering against base business objectives 
daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems  including systems operated by third party suppliers and to maintain security over our data 
cost pressures 
our costs are subject to fluctuations  particularly due to changes in commodity prices  raw materials  labor costs  foreign exchange and interest rates 
therefore  our success is dependent  in part  on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions  cost savings projects  sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions  as well as consistent productivity improvements 
we also must manage our debt and currency exposure  especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls  such as venezuela  china  india  egypt and argentina 
we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements  including sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements  and successfully manage any disruptions at company manufacturing sites 
we must implement  achieve and sustain cost improvement plans  including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization 
successfully managing these changes  including identifying  developing and retaining key employees  is critical to our success 
global economic conditions 
demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors 
the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic 
economic changes  terrorist activity  political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption  inflation  deflation or decreased demand for our products 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to manage continued global political and or economic uncertainty  especially in our significant geographic markets  due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters 
we could also be negatively impacted by a global  regional or national economic crisis  including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of  or a default by local governments  resulting in a disruption of credit markets 
such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments  including refunds of value added taxes  create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions and or negatively impact our overall liquidity 
additionally  changes in exchange controls and other limits could impact our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas 
regulatory environment 
changes in laws  regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business 
this includes changes in environmental  competitive and product related laws  as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws or the enforcement thereof 
our ability to manage regulatory  tax and legal matters including  but not limited to  product liability  patent and other intellectual property matters and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results 
results of operations the key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  other non operating items and income taxes 
the primary factors driving year over year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete  product initiatives  geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity  all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume  as well as pricing actions which can also indirectly impact volume  changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the us most of our cost of products sold and sg a are to some extent variable in nature 
accordingly  our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year over year changes in total costs 
the primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs energy and other commodities  pricing impacts  product and geographic mix for example  gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products  the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature 
the primary drivers of sg a are marketing related costs and overhead costs 
marketing related costs are primarily variable in nature  although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies 
overhead costs are also variable in nature  but on a relative basis  less so than marketing costs due to our the procter gamble company ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth 
accordingly  we generally experience more scale related impacts for these costs 
in february and november  the company made announcements related to a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain  research and development  marketing and overhead expenses 
the plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making  manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the company growth strategy 
the company expects to incur in excess of billion in before tax restructuring costs over a five year period fiscal through fiscal as part of this plan 
overall  the costs are expected to deliver in excess of billion in before tax annual savings 
net sales fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales increased to billion in on a increase in unit volume 
volume in baby care and family care grew mid single digits 
volume in fabric care and home care and in health care grew low single digits 
beauty volume was in line with the prior year 
grooming volume decreased low single digits 
volume grew low single digits in both developed and developing regions 
the impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories 
price increases added to net sales  driven by price increases across all business segments  primarily executed in prior periods to offset cost increases and devaluing developing market currencies 
foreign exchange reduced net sales by 
organic sales growth was driven by both volume and price increases 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales increased to billion in on unit volume that was consistent with the prior year period 
difficult macroeconomic conditions caused a slowdown in market growth in fiscal  particularly in developed markets 
in addition  we initiated a number of price increases across each reportable segment in fiscal  in large part to recover the rising cost of commodities and currency devaluations 
these factors negatively impacted volume growth in  but the price increases led to higher overall sales 
volume grew low single digits in beauty  grooming  health care  and baby care and family care 
fabric care and home care volume decreased low single digits 
volume grew mid single digits in developing regions and was down low single digits in developed regions 
the impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories 
price increases added to net sales  driven by price increases across all business segments and regions  primarily to help offset commodity costs and devaluing currencies in certain developing markets 
mix reduced net sales by due to unfavorable geographic mix across the beauty  grooming  health care and fabric care and home care reportable segments and unfavorable product mix 
foreign exchange was neutral to net sales 
organic sales growth was driven by price increases 
operating costs comparisons as a percentage of net sales  years ended june basis point change basis point change gross margin selling  general and administrative expense goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset and impairment charges operating margin earnings from continuing operations before income taxes net earnings from continuing operations net earnings attributable to procter gamble fiscal year compared with fiscal year gross margin expanded basis points in to of net sales  driven by higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings  partially offset by negative mix and higher commodity costs 
gross margin was positively impacted by basis points from higher pricing and approximately basis points from manufacturing cost savings 
gross margin was negatively impacted by basis points from negative geographic and product mix behind disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid tier products  both of which have lower gross margins than the company average 
gross margin was also reduced by capacity investments and to a lesser extent by foreign exchange impacts and higher commodity costs 
total sg a increased to billion in  driven by a charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in venezuela and an increase in marketing spending  partially the procter gamble company offset by reduced overhead costs as a result of the productivity and cost savings plan 
sg a as a percentage of net sales increased basis points to largely due to a basis point impact from the venezuela devaluation charge and a basis point increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales 
overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined basis points  as a basis point benefit from our productivity and cost savings plan and basis points of lower restructuring costs were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange 
this was due to a higher portion of sg a spending in strengthening currencies as compared to net sales  higher employee wages and benefit costs and increased merchandising investments 
in fiscal we incurred impairment charges of million million after tax related to the carrying value of goodwill in our appliances business and the related braun trade name intangible asset 
in fiscal we incurred impairment charges of billion billion after tax related to the carrying values of goodwill in our appliances and salon professional businesses and our koleston perfect and wella indefinite lived intangible assets  which are part of our salon professional business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more details  including factors leading to the impairment charges 
since goodwill is included in corporate for internal management and segment reporting  the goodwill impairment charges are included in the corporate segment 
the indefinite lived intangible asset impairments are also included in the corporate segment for management and segment reporting 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year gross margin contracted basis points in to of net sales 
the reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs 
gross margin was also negatively impacted by basis points from negative geographic and product mix and by basis points from the impact of increased restructuring spending due to the productivity and cost savings plan 
the negative mix resulted from disproportionate growth in developing regions  as developing regions have lower relative gross margins than developed regions 
these impacts were partially offset by a basis point impact from increased pricing and a basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings 
total sg a increased to billion in  driven by higher marketing spending to support initiative activity and a million increase in restructuring spending from our productivity and cost savings plan  partially offset by a reduction in competition law fines see item of this form k and note to our consolidated financial statements  which were million in compared to million in sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points to  as reduced competition law fines and the impact of increased scale leverage on marketing and overhead costs from higher sales were partially offset by basis points of incremental restructuring costs 
non operating items fiscal year compared with fiscal year interest expense decreased in to million  due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt 
interest income increased in to million  due to an increase in cash  cash equivalents and debt securities 
other non operating income  net primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income 
other non operating income increased million to million in mainly due to net acquisition and divestiture activities 
a holding gain of million resulting from the purchase of the balance of p g baby care and feminine care joint venture in iberia and a gain of approximately million from the sale of our italian bleach business  both in the current year  were partially offset by a million divestiture gain from the pur water filtration business in the prior year period 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year in  interest expense decreased to million  due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and a decrease in average debt outstanding 
interest income increased in to million  due to an increase in cash  cash equivalents and debt securities 
other non operating income  net decreased million to million in mainly behind the impact of minor brand divestitures 
a divestiture gain from the sale of the pur water filtration brand in fiscal was less than the zest and infasil divestiture gains in fiscal income taxes fiscal year compared with fiscal year the effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased basis points to in the primary drivers of this rate decline were as follows approximately basis points due to the non deductibility of impairment charges related to our appliances and salon professional businesses  which were higher in the base period versus the current year 
approximately basis points due to the tax impacts from acquisition and divestiture activity primarily the non taxable gain on the purchase of the balance of the baby care and feminine care joint venture in iberia 
approximately basis points due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions 
the current year net benefit was  or basis points  versus a net benefit of basis points in the prior year 
approximately basis points from the impact of the venezuela currency devaluation 
the procter gamble company fiscal year compared with fiscal year in  the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased basis points to primarily due to a basis point impact from the non deductibility of impairment charges in fiscal and the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions  which drove basis points of the tax rate difference 
the net benefit from favorable discrete adjustments was million in fiscal  which netted to basis points  versus basis points of net benefits in fiscal net earnings fiscal year compared with fiscal year net earnings from continuing operations increased billion or to billion in the combination of the net year over year impact of acquisition and divestiture gains and the net year over year decline in impairment charges drove billion of the increase 
earnings also increased due to the increase in net sales and the basis point gross margin expansion in the current year 
net earnings from discontinued operations decreased billion in due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business and the earnings from the snacks business prior to the divestiture in the prior year period 
net earnings attributable to procter gamble increased million  or to billion 
diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased to due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding 
the number of shares outstanding decreased due to billion of treasury share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program  partially offset by shares issued under share based compensation plans

diluted net earnings per share increased to 
core eps increased to primarily due to increased net sales  gross margin expansion and the reduction in shares outstanding 
core eps represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the current period charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in venezuela  the current year holding gain on the purchase of the balance of our iberian joint venture and charges in both years for european legal matters  incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan and impairments of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year in  net earnings from continuing operations decreased to billion as an increase in net sales was more than offset by the impact of impairment charges  incremental restructuring charges and an increase in income taxes

venezuela currency impacts venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under us gaap 
as a result  the us dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in venezuela 
any currency remeasurement adjustments for non dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings 
the venezuelan government has established one official exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services 
that rate was equal to bolivares fuertes vef to one us dollar through february  effective february   the venezuelan government devalued its currency relative to the us dollar from to official rate 
the remeasurement of our balance sheets in to reflect the impact of the devaluation resulted in a net after tax charge of million per share 
there will also be an ongoing impact related to translating our income statement at the new exchange rates 
moving from the rate to the rate will reduce future total company reported net sales by less than on a going basis 
this does not impact our organic sales growth rate  which excludes the impact of foreign currency changes 
versus our existing business plans  the exchange rate change reduced our reported earnings per share by approximately per share in the procter gamble company transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to cadivi venezuelan government foreign exchange administrative commission 
our overall results in venezuela are reflected in our consolidated financial statements at the official rate  which is currently the rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations 
in addition to the official exchange rate  there had been a parallel exchange market sitme that was controlled by the central bank of venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of cadivi 
the published rate was through february  the notional amount of transactions that ran through this foreign exchange rate for nonessential goods was restrictive  which for us essentially eliminated our ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than the official cadivi rate to pay for imported goods and or manage our local monetary asset balances 
when the government devalued its currency in february   it also eliminated sitme  but established a new exchange rate market program  referred to as sicad 
as of june   there is little official information available on the new auction process or the underlying auction rates 
as of june   we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of million 
local currency balances decreased since june  due to the impact of the february devaluation and an increase in payments by the government through cadivi  partially offset by an increase in the net amount of indirect value added taxes vat receivable from the government from goods receipts and shipments 
prior to the february devaluation  a portion of our net monetary assets denominated in local currency was remeasured using the sitme rate because we planned to use that amount of the net assets largely cash to satisfy us dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars 
the remaining net monetary asset balances had been reflected within our consolidated financial statements at the official exchange rate 
however  as noted in the preceding paragraph  the parallel sitme market was eliminated at the time of the february devaluation  and there is little information available on the sicad mechanism 
accordingly  all of our net monetary assets are measured at the official exchange rate at june  additionally  the venezuelan government enacted a price control law during the second half of fiscal that negatively impacted the net selling prices of certain products sold in venezuela 
depending on the ultimate transparency and liquidity of the sicad market  it is possible that we may remeasure a portion of our net monetary balances the amount of the net assets needed to satisfy us dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars  approximately million as of june  at the sicad rate 
this would result in an additional devaluation charge 
over time  we intend to restore net sales and profit to levels achieved prior to the devaluation 
however  our ability to do so will be impacted by several factors 
these include the company ability to mitigate the effect of the recently enacted price controls  any potential future devaluation  any further venezuelan government price or exchange controls  economic conditions and the availability of raw materials and utilities 
in addition  depending on the future availability of us dollars at the official rate  our local us dollar needs  our overall repatriation plans  the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors and our ability to collect amounts due from customers and the government  including vat receivable  we may have exposure for our local monetary assets 
we also have devaluation exposure for the differential between the current and potential future official exchange rates 
segment results segment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation 
the results of these reportable segments do not include certain non business unit specific costs such as interest expense  investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs 
these costs are reported in our corporate segment and are included as part of our corporate segment discussion 
additionally  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence  but do not control the financial and operating decisions and  therefore  do not consolidate these companies for us gaap purposes unconsolidated entities 
given that certain of these investments are managed as integral parts of the company business units  they are accounted for as if they were consolidated subsidiaries for management and segment reporting purposes 
this means pre tax earnings in the business units include of each pre tax income statement component 
in determining after tax earnings in the business units  we eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests  in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest  and apply the statutory tax rates 
eliminations to adjust each line item to us gaap are included in our corporate segment

corporate millions change vs change vs net sales net earnings n a n a corporate includes certain operating and non operating activities not allocated to specific business units 
these include the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level  financing and investing activities  other general corporate items  the historical results of certain divested brands and categories  certain asset impairment charges  and certain restructuring type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure  including manufacturing and workforce optimization 
corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to us gaap 
the most significant reconciling items include income taxes to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall company effective tax rate  adjustments for unconsolidated entities to eliminate net sales  cost of products sold and sg a for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for us gaap and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have ownership 
since certain unconsolidated entities and less than owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the related segments  they are accounted for similar to a wholly owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes 
this means our segment results recognize of each income statement component through before tax earnings in the segments  with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in corporate 
in determining segment net earnings  we apply the statutory tax rates with adjustments to arrive at the company effective tax rate in corporate and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests  in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest 
corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results 
accordingly  corporate net sales are generally negative 
negative net sales in corporate for decreased by million due to the purchase of the balance of our iberian joint venture after which this business is consolidated for both segment and consolidated results and the underlying sales no longer need to be eliminated and smaller adjustments required to eliminate reduced sales of the remaining unconsolidated entities

productivity and cost savings plan in february and november  the company made announcements related to a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain  research and development  marketing and overheads 
the plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making  manufacturing and other work processes to fund the company growth strategy 
as part of this plan  the company expects to incur in excess of billion in before tax restructuring costs over a five year period from fiscal through fiscal 
approximately of the costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate  given the nature of the activities  the corollary benefits achieved  the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment 
overall  the costs are expected to deliver in excess of billion in before tax annual savings 
the cumulative before tax savings realized as a result of restructuring costs incurred through were approximately million 
restructuring accruals of million as of june   are classified as current liabilities 
approximately of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal either have been or will be settled with cash 
consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring type activities  the resulting charges are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for more details on the restructuring program 
the procter gamble company cash flow  financial condition and liquidity we believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality  as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates 
operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures 
excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends 
other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses  brands and geographies 
as necessary  we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities 
the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management  economic factors and tax considerations 
operating cash flow fiscal year compared with fiscal year operating cash flow was billion in  a increase from the prior year 
operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings  adjusted for non cash items depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  asset impairments  deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses and a decrease in working capital 
increased accounts receivable used million of cash primarily to fund growth 
in addition  accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased two days due to the timing and mix of sales late in the period and foreign exchange impacts 
increased inventory used million of cash to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes  partially offset by inventory management improvement efforts 
inventory days on hand increased by one day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts 
increased accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities generated billion of cash primarily due to an increase in marketing accruals from increased advertising and other marketing costs 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year operating cash flow was billion in  in line with the prior year

however  accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down two days primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange 
inventory generated million of cash  mainly due to an increase in inventory management improvement efforts  partially offset by inventory to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes 
inventory days on hand declined by days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts and the impact of foreign exchange 
accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities used million of cash  due primarily to the payment of fines related to violations of the european competition laws 
cash flow from discontinued operations contributed approximately million to operating cash flow 
free cash flow 
we view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends  share repurchases  acquisitions and other discretionary investment 
it is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at risk compensation 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year free cash flow was billion in  an increase of versus the prior year 
the increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows 
free cash flow productivity  defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings  was in fiscal year compared with fiscal year free cash flow was billion in  a decrease of versus the prior year 
free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher capital spending to support geographic expansion 
free cash flow productivity  defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings  was in investing cash flows fiscal year compared with fiscal year net investing activities consumed billion in cash in mainly due to capital spending  cash paid for acquisitions and investments in available for sale securities  partially offset by asset sales 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year net investing activities consumed billion in cash in mainly due to capital spending  partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of billion 
these proceeds were primarily related to cash received from the sale of our snacks business in capital spending 
we manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets 
capital expenditures  primarily to support capacity expansion  innovation and cost savings  were billion in both and capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased basis points to in capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased basis points to in acquisitions 
acquisitions used billion of cash in primarily for the acquisition of our partner interest in a joint venture in iberia 
acquisitions used million of the procter gamble company cash in primarily for the acquisition of new chapter  a vitamins supplement business 
proceeds from divestitures and other asset sales 
proceeds from asset sales contributed million in cash in mainly due to the divestitures of our bleach business in italy and the braun household appliances business 
proceeds from asset sales contributed billion to cash in mainly due to the sale of our snacks business 
financing cash flows dividend payments 
our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments 
dividends per common share increased to per share in total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were billion in and billion in in april  the board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from to per share on common stock and series a and b esop convertible class a preferred stock 
this represents a increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the th consecutive year that our dividend has increased 
we have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in long term and short term debt 
we maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors  including cash flow expectations  cash requirements for ongoing operations  investment and financing plans including acquisitions and share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital 
total debt was billion as of june  and billion as of june  our total debt increased in mainly due to debt issuances and an increase in commercial paper outstanding  partially offset by bond maturities 
treasury purchases 
total share repurchases were billion in and billion in liquidity at june   our current liabilities exceeded current assets by billion  largely due to short term borrowings under our commercial paper program 
we anticipate being able to support our short term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations 
additionally  a portion of our cash is held off shore by foreign subsidiaries 
the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the united states to have a material effect on our overall liquidity  financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future 
we utilize short and long term debt to fund discretionary items  such as acquisitions and share repurchases 
we have strong short and long term debt ratings  which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets 
in addition  we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that  if needed  should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short term financing requirements 
on june   our short term credit ratings were p moody and a standard poor  while our long term credit ratings are aa moody and aa standard poor  both with a stable outlook 
we maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program 
the current facility is an billion facility split between a billion year facility and a billion day facility  which expire in august and august  respectively 
the day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in  and in accordance with  the terms of the credit agreement 
these facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future 
these credit facilities do not have cross default or ratings triggers  nor do they have material adverse events clauses  except at the time of signing 
in addition to these credit facilities  we have an automatically effective registration statement on form s filed with the sec that is available for registered offerings of short or long term debt securities 
guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements  including variable interest entities  which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity 
the procter gamble company contractual commitments the following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of june  millions total less than year years years after years recorded liabilities total debt capital leases uncertain tax positions other interest payments relating to long term debt operating leases minimum pension funding purchase obligations total contractual commitments as of june   the company consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of billion  including million of interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year  a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of june   cannot be made 
operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income 
represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements 
these future pension payments assume the company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements 
these amounts do not include expected future discretionary contributions  including the july contribution to a foreign pension plan of approximately billion 
considering the current economic environment in which the company operates  the company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements 
the projected payments beyond fiscal year are not currently determinable 
primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take or pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business 
commitments made under take or pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing 
approximately relates to service contracts for information technology  human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced 
while the amounts listed represent contractual obligations  we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity 
in such cases  we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties  resulting in a reduced payment 
the amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take or pay arrangements 
such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends 
we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position 
significant accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements in accordance with us gaap  there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application 
these include income taxes  certain employee benefits and acquisitions  goodwill and intangible assets 
we believe these accounting policies  and others set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements  should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company board of directors 
income taxes our annual tax rate is determined based on our income  statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes 
tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as depreciation expense 
these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  the tax effect of the procter gamble company expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
realization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards  is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments 
in certain of these jurisdictions  we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
these interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment 
we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  and adjust them accordingly 
we have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions 
although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain  based on currently available information  we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision  certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings  completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate 
for additional details on the company income taxes  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
employee benefits we sponsor various post employment benefits throughout the world 
these include pension plans  both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans  and other post employment benefit opeb plans  consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees 
for accounting purposes  the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations  including the following variables discount rate  expected salary increases  certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality  expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates 
these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans 
our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management best judgment regarding future expectations 
as permitted by us gaap  the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred 
if this net deferred amount exceeds of the greater of plan assets or liabilities  a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year 
the cost or benefit of plan changes  such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost  is deferred and included in expense on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 
the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense  since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary opeb plan are partially funded 
the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for  the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and opeb assets were and  respectively 
a change in the rate of return of basis points for both pension and opeb assets would impact annual after tax benefit expense by approximately million 
since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis  the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses 
discount rates used for our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan 
for our international plans  the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better 
the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans of and  respectively  represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist 
a basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately million 
a change in the opeb discount rate of basis points would impact annual after tax opeb expense by approximately million 
for additional details on our defined benefit pension and opeb plans  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions  goodwill and intangible assets our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction 
in addition  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values  with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill 
significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives 
accordingly  we typically obtain the assistance of third party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets 
the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations the procter gamble company and assumptions deemed reasonable by management  but are inherently uncertain 
we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets  which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets 
significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants  and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates and profitability  the underlying product or technology life cycles  economic barriers to entry  a brand relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows 
unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur  which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands 
other acquired intangible assets eg  certain trademarks or brands  customer relationships  patents and technologies are expected to have determinable useful lives 
our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment  market share  brand history  underlying product life cycles  operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold 
our estimates of the useful lives of determinable lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors 
all of our acquired technology and customer related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives 
the costs of determinable lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives 
the value of indefinite lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets 
we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level 
we test individual indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  an impairment test is performed and indefinite lived brands may be adjusted to a determinable life 
with the exception of our appliances and salon professional businesses  all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values 
however  future changes in the judgments  assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections  could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values 
a significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year 
the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge 
for example  the gillette intangible and goodwill amounts represent values as of a more recent acquisition date and  as such  the amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate 
gillette indefinite lived intangible assets represent approximately of the billion of indefinite lived intangible assets at june  goodwill allocated to stand alone reporting units consisting primarily of businesses purchased as part of the gillette acquisition represents of the billion of goodwill at june  this includes the shave care and appliances businesses  which are components of the grooming segment  and the batteries business  which is part of the fabric care and home care segment 
the results of our impairment testing during fiscal indicated that the estimated fair values of our appliances and salon professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts 
therefore  we recorded a non cash before and after tax impairment charge of billion in fiscal additionally  our impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets during fiscal indicated a decline in the fair value of our koleston perfect and wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values 
this resulted in a non cash  before tax impairment charge of million million after tax to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their estimated fair values 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the estimated fair value of our appliances reporting units declined further  below the carrying amount resulting from the fiscal impairment 
therefore  we recorded an additional non cash before and after tax impairment charge of million in fiscal additionally  our fourth quarter impairment testing for appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value 
this resulted in a non cash  before tax impairment charge of million million after tax to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value 
the procter gamble company the appliances business was acquired as part of the gillette acquisition in and the salon professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the wella acquisition in both businesses are stand alone reporting units 
these businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories 
because of this  their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal  which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons that drove the fiscal impairment 
the additional impairment of the appliances business in fiscal was due to the devaluation of currency in japan  a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the appliances business  relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded 
as of june   the appliances business has remaining goodwill of million  while the salon professional business has remaining goodwill of million 
as a result of the impairments  the estimated fair value of our appliances business approximates its carrying value  while the estimated fair value of the salon professional business now slightly exceeds its carrying value 
our fiscal valuations of the appliances and salon professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our long term business plans 
failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses 
new accounting pronouncements during fiscal  the company adopted asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  and asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity and requires entities to present the components of net earnings and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we chose to present net earnings and other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance also requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income 
we chose to present the requirements in the notes to the financial statements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
no other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
other information hedging and derivative financial instruments as a multinational company with diverse product offerings  we are exposed to market risks  such as changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting 
except within financing operations  we leverage the company broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments 
to the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures  we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure  instrument types and other hedging practices 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments 
derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation  sensitivity analysis and value at risk modeling 
the tests for interest rate  currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the corporatemanager value at risk model using a one year horizon and a confidence level 
the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposures move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency  commodity and interest rate instruments and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics dataset as of june  in cases where data is unavailable in riskmetrics  a reasonable proxy is included 
our market risk exposures relative to interest rates  currency rates and commodity prices  as discussed below  have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period 
in addition  we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term 
interest rate exposure on financial instruments 
interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations 
certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations 
these currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the company foreign net investments 
based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended june   including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates  we believe a near term change in interest rates  at a confidence level based on the procter gamble company historical interest rate movements  would not materially affect our financial statements 
currency rate exposure on financial instruments 
because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world  we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates 
corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity 
to manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations  we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than months 
in addition  we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions 
based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended june   we believe  at a confidence level based on historical currency rate movements  the impact of a near term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements 
commodity price exposure on financial instruments 
we use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather  supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
in addition to fixed price contracts  we may use futures  options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 
as of and during the year ended june   we did not have material commodity hedging activity 
measures not defined by us gaap our discussion of financial results includes several non gaap financial measures 
we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends  as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management 
when used in md a  we have provided the comparable gaap measure in the discussion 
these measures include organic sales growth 
organic sales growth is a non gaap measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions  divestitures and foreign exchange from year over year comparisons 
we believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis 
organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at risk compensation 
the following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth year ended june  net sales growth foreign exchange impact acquisition divestiture impact organic sales growth beauty grooming health care fabric care and home care baby care and family care total company year ended june  net sales growth foreign exchange impact acquisition divestiture impact organic sales growth beauty grooming health care fabric care and home care baby care and family care total company acquisition divestiture impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales 
core eps 
this is a measure of the company diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the company sustainable results or trends 
this includes a charge in for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in venezuela  a holding gain in on the purchase of the balance of our iberian joint venture  impairment charges in and for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  charges in and related to incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings  a significant benefit in from the settlement of us tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations and charges in  and related to pending european legal matters 
we do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results 
we believe the core eps measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year on year earnings per share growth 
core eps is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at risk compensation 
the procter gamble company the table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to core eps years ended june diluted net earnings per share continuing operations venezuela balance sheet devaluation impacts gain on purchase of balance of iberian jv impairment charges incremental restructuring charges settlement from us tax litigation charges for pending european legal matters rounding core eps core eps growth note all reconciling items are presented net of tax 
tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction 
the significant adjustment to an income tax reserve was tax expense 
there was no tax impact on eps due to the charges for pending european legal matters 
free cash flow 
free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending 
we view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends  share repurchases  acquisitions and other discretionary investment 
free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at risk compensation 
free cash flow productivity 
free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings 
free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at risk compensation 
the following table provides a numerical reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity millions operating cash flow capital spending free cash flow net earnings free cash flow productivity item a
