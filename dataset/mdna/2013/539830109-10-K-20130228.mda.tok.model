item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research  design  development  manufacture  integration  and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products 
we also provide a broad range of management  engineering  technical  scientific  logistic  and information services 
we serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense  civil  and commercial applications  with our principal customers being agencies of the us government 
in  of our billion in net sales were from the us government  either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor including from the department of defense dod  were from international customers including foreign military sales fms contracted through the us government  and were from us commercial and other customers 
our main areas of focus are in defense  space  intelligence  homeland security  and information technology  including cyber security 
we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered 
effective december   we operate in five business segments aeronautics  information systems global solutions is gs  missiles and fire control mfc  mission systems and training mst  and space systems 
this structure reflects the reorganization of our former electronic systems business segment into the new mfc and mst business segments in order to streamline our operations and enhance customer alignment 
in connection with this reorganization  management layers at our former electronic systems business segment and our former global training and logistics gtl business were eliminated  and the former gtl business was split between the two new business segments 
in addition  operating results for sandia corporation  which manages the sandia national laboratories for the us department of energy  and our equity interest in the uk atomic weapons establishment awe joint venture were transferred from our former electronic systems business segment to our space systems business segment 
the amounts  discussion  and presentation of our business segments reflect this reorganization for all years presented in this annual report on form k 
we are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in global security  as well as continuing economic pressures in the us and globally 
a significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution  improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services  and placing more security capability quickly into the hands of both our domestic and international customers at affordable prices 
recognizing that our customers are resource constrained  we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities 
despite the challenges we face  we expect to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers  invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to be successful in this environment  and return at least of free cash flow to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases 
our outlook for is premised on the assumption that sequestration does not occur  that the us government continues to support and fund our programs  which is consistent with the continuing resolution funding measure through march   and that congress approves defense budget legislation for government fiscal year gfy at a level consistent with the president s proposed defense budget for the second half of the us government s fiscal year with these assumptions  we expect net sales will decline at a mid single digit percentage rate from the record net sales amount  due to an anticipated reduction in net sales at four of five of our business segments as discussed in the business segment results of operations section below 
we expect our segment operating profit will also decrease from levels at a slightly higher percentage rate than the decline in net sales due to the factors mentioned in the business segment results of operations section below  and segment operating profit margin will accordingly be slightly lower than levels 
if sequestration or other budgetary cuts in lieu of sequestration occur  we expect these budget reductions would have a material effect on our corporation as discussed in the industry considerations section below and item a risk factors 
industry considerations us government business budget priorities the us government continues to focus on discretionary spending  entitlements  tax  and other initiatives to stimulate the economy  create jobs  and reduce the deficit 
the administration and congress are attempting to balance decisions we define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  less capital expenditures as presented on our statements of cash flows 

table of contents regarding defense  homeland security  and other federal spending priorities in a constrained fiscal environment imposed by the budget control act of budget act  which reduced defense spending by a minimum of billion over a ten year period that began in gfy in light of the budget act and deficit reduction pressures generally  it is likely that discretionary spending by the federal government will remain constrained for a number of years 
notably  should congress and the administration fail to change or further delay the pending sequestration of appropriations in gfy imposed by the budget act  currently scheduled to take effect on march  as adjusted by the american taxpayer relief act of taxpayer relief act  both our dod and non dod customers budgets would be reduced significantly and there would be a direct and significant reduction in our customers contract awards 
although the taxpayer relief act delayed sequestration two months from january   to march   and reduced the amount of the gfy budget cuts  the impacts to our customers remain significant with limited time to implement spending reductions required under sequestration 
in addition  congress passed a continuing resolution funding measure for gfy to finance all us government activities through march  under this continuing resolution  partial year funding at amounts consistent with appropriated levels for gfy are available  subject to certain restrictions  but new spending initiatives are not authorized 
our key programs continue to be supported and funded under the continuing resolution financing mechanism 
however  during periods covered by continuing resolutions or until the regular appropriation bills are passed  and pending decisions related to sequestration we may experience delays in the receipt of orders for our products and services due to lack of funding  and those delays may affect our results of operations and cash flows 
while the specific effects of sequestration still cannot be determined  automatic across the board cuts would approximately double the amount of the ten year billion reduction in defense spending that began in gfy already required by the budget act  including the budget for overseas contingencies operations oco and any unobligated balances from prior years  and would have significant consequences to our business and industry 
non dod agencies would also have significantly reduced budgets 
there would be disruption of ongoing programs  impacts to our supply chain  contractual actions including partial or complete terminations  potential facilities closures  and thousands of personnel reductions across the industry that would severely impact advanced manufacturing operations and engineering expertise  and accelerate the loss of skills and knowledge 
current estimates suggest that sequestration would reduce total gfy non military personnel defense funding by to approximately billion 
in addition  general estimates suggest that sequestration could result in an approximate reduction to the total gfy non defense budget 
however  if sequestration goes into effect on march   government agencies will have already expended funds for several months of gfy therefore  in order to achieve the across the board cuts imposed by sequestration over a shorter time period  the effective percentage reductions for the remaining months of gfy would be higher than the above percentages 
while current dod planning for the ongoing continuing resolution has focused on operating accounts in lieu of other accounts such as procurement and research  development  training  and evaluation due to the ability to quickly adjust activities and programs funded in these accounts  we understand that sequestration related cuts are likely to be applied across the board at the individual program  project  and activity level  thus impacting all defense programs and contractors regardless of how they align to our country s most critical national priorities and mission areas 
consequently  we expect that sequestration  or other budgetary cuts in lieu of sequestration  would have a material effect on our corporation 
our current sales outlook for is a mid single digit percentage rate decline from our record net sales amount  presuming sequestration does not occur  the continuing resolution ends on march   and other factors 
based on our preliminary understanding of sequestration and noting that it is difficult to estimate how sequestration would be implemented  we believe that  should congress and the administration fail to change or further delay sequestration  our net sales would be lower than net sales by more than the mid single digit outlook noted above 
future years could be materially impacted 
however  subject to the uncertainty described above  we expect that the impact of sequestration on our operating results may lag in certain of our businesses with longer cycles such as our aeronautics and space systems business segments  and our products businesses within our mfc and mst business segments  due to our production contract backlog being funded with money from the us government s gfy and prior budgets 
we expect that earnings and cash flow reductions  prior to restructuring activities  would generally follow a pattern similar to the net sales reductions 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost and cash flow impact of any restructuring initiatives potentially including but not limited to severance payments made to employees  facility closure expenses  and impairments of assets  including goodwill to align our cost structure to a lower sales base 

table of contents sequestration likely would result in significant rescheduling or termination activity with our supplier base 
such activity likely would result in claims from our suppliers  which may include both the amount established in any settlement agreements  the costs of evaluating the supplier settlement proposals  and the costs of negotiating settlement agreements 
we expect that these costs would be recovered from our customers 
lockheed martin is committed to the fair treatment of its employees and compliance with law 
accordingly  if sequestration or other budget cuts intended to avoid sequestration occur  we will provide affected employees the notice required by the federal and applicable state worker adjustment and retraining notification warn acts when we conclude  based on the circumstances and those laws  that notice is required or otherwise appropriate 
the office of management and budget and dod have issued guidance intended to assure that the costs of complying with federal and state warn acts are recoverable  and we expect to recover these costs 
despite the continuing uncertainty on us government budgets  the investments and acquisitions we have made in recent years have sought to align our businesses with what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas 
the possibility remains  however  that our programs could be materially reduced  extended  or terminated as a result of the government s continuing assessment of priorities  changes in government priorities  the implementation of sequestration  or other budget cuts intended to avoid sequestration 
department of defense business the passage of the budget act imposed specific limits on security and non security spending beginning in gfy the gfy dod base budget is the first to reflect the reduced spending limits imposed by the budget act and is consistent with its limits on discretionary spending 
the gfy request has been delayed as a result of the ongoing federal budgetary negotiations 
the gfy request will likely reflect a continuation of the spending limits with some variation as a result of sequester negotiations 
in prior years  the administration has requested and congress has provided funds for us military operations in afghanistan and iraq  and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations  through a separate oco funding outside of the base dod budget 
the oco funding for gfy totaled billion  and the administration requested billion for gfy we expect that the fiscal request will continue these reductions  reflecting the completion of us military operations in iraq and reduced operations in afghanistan 
our net sales historically have not been significantly dependent on overseas contingency or supplemental funding requests and  therefore  we continue to focus our attention on the dod s base budget for support and funding of our programs 
the gfy budget proposal reflected the administration s new national security strategy and is consistent with the lower spending levels imposed by the budget act 
we have no specific indications that the gfy budget will deviate significantly  other than the reduction due to the sequester delay as described above  from the estimated spending levels in the gfy request 
despite these reduced defense spending levels  we believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the dod and our programs were well supported in the gfy budget request 
for example  the budget supported continuation of all three variants of the f and maintains the same ultimate inventory objective of  aircraft for the us government 
additionally  the dod has specifically cited continued support for a broad spectrum of our programs 
given the administration s emphasis on affordability and the need to find further efficiencies in the management and operations of dod  the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment  expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solutions  and vastly improved levels of network and cyber security  all remain national priorities 
to address these priorities  we continue to focus on growing our portfolio in these areas  diversifying our business  and expanding into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels  unmanned aerial systems  rotary wing aviation  and land vehicles 
non department of defense business our experience in the defense arena  together with our core information technology and services expertise  has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies  including the departments of homeland security  justice  commerce  health and human services  transportation  and energy  the us postal service  the social security administration ssa  the federal aviation administration  the national aeronautics and space administration  the veterans administration  national science foundation  and the environmental protection agency epa 

table of contents as with the dod  all other departments and agencies were impacted by the budget act 
the result would be that budgets for gfy and beyond will be reduced further below the gfy budget 
should sequester go into effect on march   our non dod customers will also be significantly affected as the across the board reductions will also be applied to their available gfy discretionary funds 
our businesses with smaller  short term contracts that work with our non dod customers could be significantly impacted by the across the board reductions  such as our is gs business segment 
we have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence  knowledge management  and government information technology solutions for our customers  including the ssa and the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
we also provide program management  business strategy and consulting  complex systems development and maintenance  complete life cycle software support  information assurance  and enterprise solutions 
we believe that there will be continued demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions in order to reduce costs of operations  but at a slower pace in the near term 
in addition  we believe there are opportunities in the health care and energy space 
consistent with our dod business  a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solutions  and improved levels of network and cyber security all appear to be priorities in our non dod business as well 
homeland security  critical infrastructure protection  and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities 
other business considerations international business we remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers 
we conduct business with other governments primarily through our aeronautics  mfc  and mst business segments 
our international sales are comprised of fms transactions contracted through the us government and direct commercial sales transactions in which we sell directly to the international customer 
in aeronautics  the us government and eight other government development partners are working together on the design  testing  production  and sustainment of the f lightning ii  and israel and japan have selected the f as their next generation combat aircraft 
the first international deliveries of the f were made in  with two aircraft delivered to the united kingdom 
the number of aircraft for international customers in the more recent and future low rate initial production lrip contracts continues to increase 
the f fighting falcon has been selected by customers worldwide  including recent orders from iraq and oman  with follow on buys from countries 
we continue to expand the c j super hercules air mobility aircraft s international footprint with customers in countries 
in global sustainment  we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer oem for our major platforms  such as our agreement to upgrade f aircraft for taiwan 
we have also set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension  including new wings and support for the us  norway  canada  and taiwan s p fleet 
our mfc business segment produces the patriot advanced capability pac missile  an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats  for international customers including japan  germany  the netherlands  taiwan  and the united arab emirates uae 
additionally  the uae entered into a fms agreement with the us government for the first international sale of the terminal high altitude area defense thaad missile defense system  with expectations for further production awards 
other countries in the middle east as well as those in the asia pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems 
in mst  with regard to the aegis combat system aegis  we perform activities in the development  production  ship integration and test  and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as japan  spain  korea  and australia 
the system also has been selected to be used as a ground based missile defense system in europe  referred to as aegis ashore 
this business segment has contracts with the canadian government for the upgrade and support of combat systems on halifax class frigates 
the littoral combat ship lcs is another program generating interest from potential international customers 
we are responsible for integrating mission systems and sensors  including the digital cockpit and weapons  for the mh maritime helicopter produced for the royal australian navy  and in the danish government signed an official letter of offer and acceptance formalizing its intent to buy nine mh r helicopters 
we continue to upgrade the united kingdom s warrior fighting vehicles  an award received in 
table of contents status of f program the f program consists of multiple contracts 
the development contract is being performed concurrently with the lrip contracts 
concurrent performance of development and production contracts is used for complex programs to test airplanes  shorten the time to field systems  and achieve overall cost savings 
we expect the development portion of the f program will be substantially complete in  with less significant efforts to continue into production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the us government s current inventory objective of  aircraft for the air force  marine  and navy variants of the aircraft  commitments from our eight international partners and two international customers  as well as expressions of interest from other countries 
on the development contract  our flight tests and test points were ahead of our goals for the year and the aircraft also surpassed  flight hours 
the development contract currently has million of incentive fees remaining  however  we expect to have the opportunity to earn approximately million of this amount over the remainder of the contract 
this amount includes about million of fees that we expect will be allocated to specific milestones with the remainder allocated to a customer assessment of performance at the end of the development contract 
after updating our estimates at completion on the contract in  we reduced the profit booking rate to reflect lower expected estimated fees at completion 
the inception to date impact of the revised booking rate reduced profit by approximately million during we will continue to record profit at the revised booking rate for the duration of the contract unless further adjustments are necessary 
we continue to make progress on our production tempo with the delivery of aircraft to our domestic and international customers during the year  bringing the cumulative deliveries total to  which includes development aircraft and production aircraft 
we also made significant contractual progress recently with the completion of negotiations on the lrip aircraft contract  award of an undefinitized contract for certain lrip aircraft  and received long lead funding for lrip aircraft 
we have production aircraft in backlog as of december  given the size and complexity of the f program  we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance  program schedule  cost  and requirements as part of the dod  congressional  and international partners oversight and budgeting processes 
current program challenges include  but are not limited to  supplier and partner performance  software development  receiving funding for lrip contracts on a timely basis  contractual withholds  executing future flight tests  and findings resulting from testing 
portfolio shaping activities we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers 
we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities  and through acquisition  divestiture  and internal realignment activities 
internal realignments are designed to more fully leverage existing capabilities and enhance development and delivery of products and services 
we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies 
we have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years 
we also may explore the divestiture of businesses 
in pursuing our business strategy  we routinely conduct discussions  evaluate targets  and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions  divestitures  joint ventures  and equity investments 
we used million and million for the acquisitions of businesses in and in  we acquired chandler may  inc chandler may and cdl systems ltd 
cdl in the fourth quarter and procerus technologies  lc procerus in the first quarter 
these companies specialize in the design  development  manufacturing  control  and support of advanced unmanned systems  which expand our offerings in support of our customers increased emphasis on advanced unmanned systems and are consistent with our strategy to maintain a portfolio of technology advanced options 
these companies are part of our mst business segment where they have been integrated into our portfolio of unmanned systems and technologies to align their product and service offerings to the us army 
in  we acquired qtc holdings inc qtc and sim industries bv sim industries in the fourth quarter 
qtc provides outsourced medical evaluation services to the us government and has been included in our is gs business segment 
sim industries designs  develops  and manufactures full motion and fixed based civil aviation flight simulators for a wide range of airline customers and independent pilot training centers worldwide and has been included in our mst business segment 
these companies complement our core capabilities and align with our strategy to expand into closely related markets and expand our customer base 

table of contents in pursuing our business strategies  we have also divested certain businesses over the past three years 
recent divestitures consisted of savi technology  inc savi in  pacific architects and engineers  inc pae in  and enterprise integration group eig in for additional information  see note acquisitions and divestitures of our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations since our operating cycle is long term and involves many types of contracts for the design  development  and manufacturing of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules  the results of operations of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussions of comparative results among years should be viewed in this context 
all per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a per diluted share basis  unless otherwise noted 
our consolidated results of operations were as follows in millions  except per share data operating results net sales cost of sales a other income  net operating profit a interest expense other non operating income expense  net a income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations net loss earnings from discontinued operations net earnings diluted earnings loss per common share continuing operations discontinued operations total a in the fourth quarter of  gains and losses on investments used to fund our deferred compensation plan liabilities were reclassified from other non operating income expense  net to other unallocated costs within cost of sales for all years presented on our statements of earnings in order to align the classification of changes in the market value of investments held for the plan with changes in the value of the corresponding plan liabilities 
the amounts in the above table and all prior year amounts included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflect  as appropriate  this reclassification 
net gains on these investments in   and were million  million  and million 
the following provides an overview of our consolidated results of operations 
product sales are predominantly generated in the aeronautics  mfc  mst  and space systems business segments  and most of our services sales are generated in our is gs and mfc business segments 
our consolidated net sales were as follows in millions net sales net sales products services total substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting 
under the poc method  we record net sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract  as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion 
the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the following discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations section because  due to the nature of poc accounting  changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales 

table of contents product sales our product sales represent about of our net sales for both and product sales increased million  or in compared to due to production volume and deliveries  as well as higher risk retirements on certain programs

services sales at mst decreased about million primarily due to lower volume on various training services programs 
services sales at is gs decreased about million primarily due to the substantial completion of the outsourcing desktop initiative for nasa odin during and lower volume on the hanford mission support hanford contract  partially offset by higher net sales from qtc  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of our services sales represent about of our net sales for and our services sales increased million  or  during compared to the increase in services sales was attributable to higher services sales at both our mfc and is gs business segments 
services sales at mfc increased about million primarily due to growth on the special operations forces contractor logistics support services sof clss program  partially offset by decreased volume on various services programs 
services sales at is gs increased about million due to activities on a number of smaller contracts 
cost of sales cost of sales  for both products and services  consist of materials  labor  and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs overhead and general and administrative 
for each of our contracts  we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level  which form the basis for estimating our total costs at completion of the contract 
our consolidated cost of sales were as follows in millions cost of sales cost of product sales of product sales cost of services sales of services sales severance and other charges other unallocated costs total due to the nature of poc accounting  changes in our cost of product and services sales are typically accompanied by changes in our net sales 
the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and with our business segment results of operations section 
we have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales that would have a material impact on our future operations 

table of contents cost of product sales the increase of million  or  in cost of product sales during compared to was attributable to higher cost of product sales at our aeronautics  mst  and space systems business segments  partially offset by lower cost of product sales at our is gs and mfc business segments 
cost of product sales at aeronautics increased by about million primarily due to increased production volume on various programs  including f lrip contracts  and the impact of additional aircraft deliveries 
cost of product sales at mst increased by about million primarily due to increased volume on ship and aviation system programs partially offset by reserves of about million for contract cost matters on ship and aviation system programs recorded in the fourth quarter of including the terminated presidential helicopter program 
cost of product sales at space systems increased by about million primarily due to increased volume on commercial satellites programs  orion  and various strategic and defensive missile programs 
cost of product sales at is gs decreased by about million primarily due to the substantial completion of various programs during as well as lower volume on numerous other programs 
cost of product sales at mfc decreased by about million primarily due to higher risk retirements from tactical missile programs and fire control systems programs as well as the favorable resolution of contractual matters  partially offset by volume on air and missile defense programs 
the decrease in the percentage of cost of product sales relative to product sales in compared to primarily was due to higher risk retirements primarily tactical missile programs as well as the favorable resolution of contractual matters at mfc and higher risk retirements and lower reserves on ship and aviation system programs at mst

cost of product sales at mfc increased about million primarily due to production on air and missile defense programs 
cost of product sales at is gs decreased about million primarily due to the absence of the dris program and lower volume on the jtrs program 
cost of product sales at mst decreased about million primarily due to decreased volume on certain ship and aviation system programs and recording of reserves on certain undersea systems programs in cost of product sales decreased at space systems by about million primarily due to lower volume on the nasa external tank and orion programs

severance and other charges during  we recorded charges related to certain severance actions totaling million  net of state tax benefits  of which million related to our aeronautics business segment and million related to the reorganization of our former electronic systems business segment note 
these charges reduced our net earnings by million 
per share and consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions 
the severance actions at our aeronautics business segment resulted from cost reduction initiatives  including the consolidation of selected program support activities among certain aeronautics locations 

table of contents during  we recorded severance charges related to various severance actions totaling million  net of state tax benefits  of which million  million  and million related to our aeronautics business segment  space systems business segment  and our is gs business segment and corporate headquarters 
these charges reduced our net earnings by million 
per share and consisted of severance costs associated with the elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions 
these severance actions resulted from a strategic review of these businesses and our corporate headquarters to better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions 
the workforce reductions at the business segments also reflect changes in program lifecycles  where several of our major programs are either transitioning out of development and into production or are ending 
during  we recorded a charge of million  net of state tax benefits  related to the voluntary executive separation program vesp 
the charge  which included lump sum special payments for qualifying executives  reduced our net earnings by million 
per share 
the amounts of the vesp attributable to our business segments were million at aeronautics  million at is gs  million at mfc  million at mst  and million at space systems 
the remaining million was attributable to our corporate headquarters 
also  in  our mst business segment decided to consolidate certain of its operations  including the closure of a facility in eagan  minnesota 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to cost of sales of million  net of state tax benefits  which reduced our net earnings by million 
per share 
the majority of the charge was associated with the accrual of severance payments to employees  with the remainder associated with impairment of assets 
we expect to recover a substantial amount of these severance charges  including the charge related to the vesp  in future periods through the pricing of our products and services to the us government and other customers 
while the vesp is expected to be recovered over several years  the other severance charges are typically expected to be recovered within a one year period after the charge has been incurred  with the impact included in the respective business segment s results of operations 
other unallocated costs other unallocated costs principally include the non cash fas cas pension adjustment  stock based compensation  and other corporate costs 
these costs are not allocated to the business segments and  therefore  are excluded from the costs of product and services sales see note information on business segments of our consolidated financial statements for a description of these items 
the million decrease in other unallocated costs between and primarily was due to a decrease in the non cash fas cas pension adjustment of million  partially offset by fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items  none of which were individually significant 
other unallocated costs increased million between and  primarily attributable to an increase in the non cash fas cas pension adjustment of million  which included increased fas pension expense in compared to due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate in for more information  see the related discussion in critical accounting policies postretirement benefit plans 
other income  net other income  net for was million  compared to million in and million in the changes between years primarily were due to fluctuations in equity earnings in investees in our space systems business segment 
interest expense interest expense for was million  compared to million in and million in the increase between the years primarily was due to increased interest expense from the billion issuance of long term debt on september   partially offset by the redemption of million in certain long term notes in the fourth quarter of other non operating income expense  net other non operating income expense  net was million in  compared to million in and million in the change between years primarily was due to premiums of million on early extinguishments of debt that occurred in note 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was for  for  and for the rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for dividends related to certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature and tax deductions for us manufacturing activities 

table of contents the effective income tax rate for included a reduction in the income tax benefit of the us manufacturing deduction primarily caused by the billion discretionary pension contributions in the fourth quarter of  which increased income tax expense by million 
per share 
as a result of the accelerated pension contributions in  we expect to capture most of the reduced manufacturing deduction over the next two years through higher taxable income

per diluted share  through the elimination of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the us congressional joint committee on taxation completing its review of the internal revenue service appeals division s resolution of adjustments related to tax years through the effective income tax rates for and also included the us research and development r d tax credit that expired on december  on january   the president signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which retroactively reinstates the r d credit for two years  from january  through december  since tax law changes are recognized in the period in which new legislation is enacted  the corporation did not recognize the tax benefit of the r d tax credit in the effective tax rate for was affected by the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of  which eliminated the tax deduction for company paid retiree prescription drug expenses to the extent they are reimbursed under medicare part d  beginning in as a result  we recorded additional income tax expense of million in net earnings from continuing operations we reported net earnings from continuing operations of billion per share in  billion per share in  and billion per share in both net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above 
in addition  earnings per share in and benefited from a net decrease of common shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased  which were partially offset by share issuances under our stock based awards and certain defined contribution plans 
net decreases of million and million in and represented and of our shares outstanding at the beginning of each year 
net loss earnings from discontinued operations amounts related to discontinued operations in were not significant and  accordingly  were included in operating profit

business segment results of operations we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered 
we operate in five business segments aeronautics  is gs  mfc  mst  and space systems 
net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales  as these activities are eliminated in consolidation 
intercompany transactions are generally negotiated under terms and conditions similar to our third party contracts 
operating profit of our business segments includes equity earnings or losses from investees because the operating activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those business segments 
operating profit of our business segments excludes the non cash fas cas pension adjustment described below  expense for stock based compensation programs  the effects of items not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance  such as charges related to significant severance actions in and and the charges in related to the vesp and the facilities consolidation within mst note  gains or losses from divestitures note  the effects of certain legal settlements  corporate costs not allocated to our business segments  and other miscellaneous corporate activities 
these items are included in the reconciling item unallocated expenses  net between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit 

table of contents the results of operations of our business segments include pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with us government cost accounting standards cas 
the non cash fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with gaap and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas 
cas governs the extent to which pension costs can be allocated to and recovered on us government contracts 
the cas expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts and  therefore  is recognized in each of our business segments net sales and cost of sales 
the operating results in the following tables exclude businesses included in discontinued operations note for all years presented 
summary operating results for each of our business segments were as follows in millions net sales aeronautics information systems global solutions missiles and fire control mission systems and training space systems total net sales operating profit aeronautics information systems global solutions missiles and fire control mission systems and training space systems total business segment operating profit unallocated expenses  net non cash fas cas pension adjustment fas pension expense less cas expense non cash fas cas pension adjustment a severance and other charges b stock based compensation other  net c total unallocated expenses  net total consolidated operating profit a fas pension expense increased in compared to  and in to  primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate in and the segment operating profit includes pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with cas

b severance and other charges include the severance charges recorded in associated with our aeronautics business segment and the reorganization of our former electronic systems business segment  for  include the severance charges associated with our aeronautics  is gs  and space systems business segments  and corporate headquarters  and for  include the charges related to the vesp and the facilities consolidation within our mst business segment note 
severance charges for initiatives that are not significant are included in business segment operating profit 
c the change between years primarily was due to fluctuations in expense associated with various corporate items  none of which were individually significant 
the following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment 
backlog was approximately billion  billion  and billion at december    and these amounts included both funded backlog unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated 
backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contracts 
funded backlog was approximately billion at december  management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit  and not by type or amount of operating expense 
consequently  our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit  consistent with our approach for managing the business 
this approach is consistent with the overall life cycle of our contracts  as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit  and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion 

table of contents we regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses 
the cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract 
for example  cost data provided to our customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product such as a wing box on an aircraft or for services  the type of work being performed such as help desk support 
our contracts generally are cost based  which allows for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services 
most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated costs to provide the product or service 
this approach for negotiating contracts with our us government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs 
we also may enter into long term supply contracts for certain materials or components  to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices 
many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements 
at the outset of a contract  we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical  schedule  and costs aspects of the contract  and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract 
the estimates consider the technical requirements for example  a newly developed product versus a mature product  the schedule and associated tasks for example  the number and type of milestone events  and costs for example  material  labor  subcontractor and overhead 
the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements  schedule  and costs in the initial estimated costs at completion 
profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical  schedule and costs aspects of the contract 
conversely  our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated costs to complete the contract increase 
all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate 
we have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the us government which cannot be specifically described 
the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results  and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs 
our net sales are primarily derived from long term contracts for products and services provided to the us government as well as fms contracted through the us government 
we account for these contracts  as well as product contracts with non us government customers  using the poc method of accounting  which represent substantially all of our net sales 
we derive our remaining net sales from contracts to provide services to non us government customers  which we account for under the services method of accounting 
under the poc method of accounting  we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion 
cost reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs plus a fee 
for fixed priced contracts  net sales and cost of sales are recognized as products are delivered or as costs are incurred 
due to the nature of the poc method of accounting  changes in our cost of sales are typically accompanied by a related change in our net sales 
in the discussion of comparative segment results  changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume 
changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels  deliveries  or service levels on individual contracts 
volume changes typically include a corresponding change in segment operating profit based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract 
in addition  comparability of our segment operating profit may be impacted by changes in estimated profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the poc method of accounting 
increases in the estimated profit booking rates  typically referred to as risk retirements  usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract 
conversely  conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated costs at completion and a reduction of the estimated profit booking rate 
increases or decreases in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such changes 
segment operating profit may also be impacted  favorably or unfavorably  by other matters such as the resolution of contractual matters  reserves for disputes  asset impairments and insurance recoveries  among others 
segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements  reductions of profit booking rates  or other matters are presented net of state income taxes 
our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume  including net profit rate adjustments and other matters  increased segment operating profit  net of state income taxes  by approximately billion  billion  and billion for   and the increase in our consolidated net adjustments for as compared to primarily was due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments and resolution of contractual matters at our mst and mfc business segments 
the consolidated net adjustments for are inclusive of approximately million in unfavorable items  about million higher than the variance is primarily due to an adjustment on our f program as described in our 
table of contents aeronautics business segment s results of operations discussion 
the increase in our consolidated net adjustments for as compared to primarily was due to an increase in profit booking rate adjustments at our is gs and aeronautics business segments 
aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research  design  development  manufacture  integration  sustainment  support  and upgrade of advanced military aircraft  including combat and air mobility aircraft  unmanned air vehicles  and related technologies 
aeronautics major programs include the f lightning ii joint strike fighter  f raptor  f fighting falcon  c hercules  and the c m super galaxy 
aeronautics operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margins backlog at year end compared to aeronautics net sales for increased million  or  compared to the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately million from f lrip contracts principally due to increased production volume  about million from f programs primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries f aircraft delivered in compared to in partially offset by lower volume on sustainment activities due to the completion of modification programs for certain international customers  and approximately million from c programs due to higher aircraft deliveries four c m aircraft delivered in compared to two in 
partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately million from decreased production volume and lower risk retirements on the f program as final aircraft deliveries were completed in the second quarter of  approximately million from the f development contract primarily due to the inception to date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of and to a lesser extent lower volume  and about million from a decrease in volume on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to higher volume 
net sales for c programs were comparable to as a decline in sustainment activities largely was offset by increased aircraft deliveries 
aeronautics operating profit for increased million  or  compared to the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately million from c programs due to an increase in risk retirements  about million from f programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements  approximately million from f lrip contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements  and about million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain f contracts 
partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about million from the f development contract primarily due to the inception to date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of  approximately million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the f program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of  and approximately million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume 
operating profit for c programs was comparable to adjustments not related to volume  including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above  were approximately million lower for compared to compared to aeronautics net sales for increased billion  or  compared to the growth in net sales primarily was due to higher volume of about million for work performed on the f lrip contracts as production increased  higher volume of about million for c programs due to an increase in deliveries c j aircraft delivered in compared to during and support activities  about million for f support activities and an increase in aircraft deliveries f aircraft delivered in compared to during  and approximately million for higher volume on c programs two c m aircraft delivered in compared to one during 
these increases partially were offset by a decline in net sales of approximately million due to lower volume on the f program and lower net sales of about million for the f development contract as development work decreased 

table of contents aeronautics operating profit for increased million  or  compared to the increase primarily was attributable to approximately million of higher operating profit on c programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks  increased volume and risk retirements on f programs of about million and c programs of approximately million  and about million due to risk retirements on other aeronautics sustainment activities in these increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately million on the f program and f development contract primarily due to lower volume and about million on other programs  including f lrip  primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in compared to adjustments not related to volume  including net profit rate adjustments described above  were approximately million higher in compared to backlog backlog decreased in compared to mainly due to lower orders on f contracts and c programs  partially offset by higher orders on f programs 
backlog increased in compared to mainly due to higher orders on f contracts  which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the c programs 
trends we expect aeronautics will experience a mid single digit percentage range decline in net sales for as compared to a decrease in net sales from a decline in f and c j aircraft deliveries is expected to be partially offset by an increase in net sales volume on f lrip contracts 
operating profit is projected to decrease at a high single digit percentage range from levels due to the expected decline in net sales as well as changes in aircraft mix  resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years 
information systems global solutions our is gs business segment provides management services  integrated information technology solutions  and advanced technology systems and expertise across a broad spectrum of applications for civil  defense  intelligence  and other government customers 
is gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments 
is gs has been impacted by the continuing downturn in the federal information technology budgets and the impact of the continuing resolution that was effective on october   the start of the us government s fiscal year 
is gs operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margins backlog at year end compared to is gs net sales for decreased million  or  compared to the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately million due to the substantial completion of various programs during primarily jtrs  odin  and uk census  and about million due to lower volume on numerous other programs primarily hanford  warfighter information network tactical win t  command  control  battle management and communications cbmc  and transportation worker identification credential twic 
partially offsetting the decreases were higher net sales of approximately million from qtc  which was acquired early in the fourth quarter of  and about million from increased activity on numerous other programs  primarily federal cyber security programs and persistent threat detection system ptds operational support 
is gs operating profit for decreased million  or  compared to the decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately million due to the favorable impact of the odin contract completion in  about million due to an increase in reserves for performance issues related to an international airborne surveillance system in  and approximately million due to lower volume on certain programs primarily cbmc and win t 
partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in operating profit due to higher risk retirements of approximately million from the twic program  and about million due to increased activity on numerous other programs  primarily federal cyber security programs and ptds operational support

adjustments not related to volume  including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above  were approximately million higher for compared to 
table of contents compared to is gs net sales for decreased million  or  compared to the decrease primarily was attributable to lower volume of approximately million due to the absence of the dris program that supported the us census and a decline in activities on the jtrs program 
this decrease partially was offset by increased net sales on numerous programs 
is gs operating profit for increased million  or  compared to operating profit increased approximately million due to volume and the retirement of risks in and the absence of reserves recognized in on numerous programs including among others  odin about million and twic and automated flight service station programs 
the increases in operating profit partially were offset by the absence of the dris program and a decline in activities on the jtrs program of about million 
adjustments not related to volume  including net profit rate adjustments described above  were approximately million higher in compared to backlog backlog decreased in compared to primarily due to the substantial completion of various programs in primarily odin  uk census  and jtrs 
the decrease in backlog during compared to mainly was due to declining activities on the jtrs program and several other smaller programs 
trends we expect is gs net sales to decline in in the mid single digit percentage range as compared to primarily due to the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets 
operating profit is expected to decline in in the mid single digit percentage range consistent with the expected decline in net sales  resulting in margins that are comparable with results

backlog decreased slightly in compared to primarily due to higher sales volume on various integrated warfare systems and sensors programs 
trends we expect mst s net sales to decline in in the low single digit percentage range as compared to due to the completion of ptds deliveries in and expected lower volume on training services programs 
operating profit and margin are expected to increase slightly from levels primarily due to anticipated improved contract performance 
space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the research and development  design  engineering  and production of satellites  strategic and defensive missile systems  and space transportation systems 
space systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems 
space systems major programs include the space based infrared system sbirs  advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  mobile user objective system muos  global positioning satellite gps iii system  geostationary operational environmental satellite r series goes r  trident ii d fleet ballistic missile  and orion 
operating results for our space systems business segment include our equity interests in united launch alliance ula  which provides expendable launch services for the us government  united space alliance usa  which provided processing activities for the space shuttle program and is winding down following the completion of the last space shuttle mission in  and a joint venture that manages the uk s atomic weapons establishment program 
space systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margins backlog at year end compared to space systems net sales for increased million  or  compared to the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately million due to increased commercial satellite deliveries two commercial satellites delivered in compared to one during  about million from the orion program due to higher volume and an increase in risk retirements  and approximately million from increased volume on various strategic and defensive missile programs

trends we expect space systems net sales to decline in in the mid single digit percentage range as compared to due primarily to the absence of any commercial satellite deliveries in operating profit is expected to decline in the low double digit percentage range in primarily due to lower equity earnings from usa  as no further significant activity is expected due to its wind down in  and lower sales volume  resulting in a decline in operating margins between the years 
liquidity and cash flows we have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise 
consistent with that strategy  we have invested in our business  including capital expenditures and independent research and development  returned cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases  made selective acquisitions of businesses  and managed our debt levels 
we have generated strong operating cash flows  which have been the primary source of funding for our operations  debt service and repayments  capital expenditures  share repurchases  dividends  acquisitions  and postretirement benefit plan funding 
we have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions  as needed or when opportunistic 
we expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the 
table of contents foreseeable future 
we have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary  as discussed in the capital structure  resources  and other section 
we have access to the credit markets  if needed  for liquidity or general corporate purposes  including letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts 
cash received from customers  either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred  is our primary source of cash 
we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer 
billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors  including the contract type 
we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  which together represent approximately half of the sales we recorded in  as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed 
by way of contrast  we generally do not bill our fixed price contracts until milestones  including deliveries  are achieved 
a number of our fixed price contracts may provide for performance based payments  which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract 
the amount of performance based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract 
such payments may precede our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance  thereby increasing our cash flows 
the us government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed price contracts  rather than performance based payments 
in contrast to negotiated performance based payment terms  progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract 
while the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same  performance based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows 
in addition  our cash flows may be affected if the us government decides to withhold payments on receivables 
the amount of withholds increased to approximately million as of december   primarily at our aeronautics business segment related to us government audits of our business systems and certain delivered f aircraft 
while the impact of withholding delays the receipt of cash  the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary 
the majority of our capital expenditures for and those planned for can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure  equipment  and information technology 
expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments 
for example  we have projects underway in our aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support production of the f combat aircraft 
in addition  we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities  inclusive of our efforts to consolidate and reduce leased facilities 
we also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure as well as for the development or purchase of internal use software 
the following table provides a summary of our cash flow information in millions followed by a discussion of the key elements operating activities net earnings non cash adjustments changes in working capital other  net net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities cash and cash equivalents at end of year operating activities compared to net cash provided by operating activities decreased billion in as compared to primarily due to changes in working capital of billion and increased pension contributions of billion  net of cas recoveries 
the decrease of billion in cash provided by working capital defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred was driven by higher payments of accounts payable due to timing as well as the timing of production and billing cycles affecting customer advances and progress payments applied to 
table of contents inventories 
additionally  growth in accounts receivable  primarily due to the timing of finalizing contract negotiations on the f lrip contracts in the fourth quarter of  which delayed our billings  as well as the impact of us government withholdings on the f program reduced the cash provided by operating activities 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in as compared to primarily due to changes in working capital 
cash provided by working capital increased by million due to increases in accounts payable resulting from the timing of payments and an increase in customer advances due to the timing of production and billing schedules 
this improvement in cash from working capital partially was offset by an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of contract negotiations and billing activities on the f program 
partially offsetting the increase in cash provided by working capital was higher pension contributions  net of cas recoveries of million

under the program  we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock under the program for billion  and there remained billion authorized for additional share repurchases 
cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during   and totaled million  million  and million 
those activities resulted in the issuance of million shares  million shares  and million shares during the respective periods 
long term debt in  we paid million to complete an exchange of debt note to take advantage of the low interest rate environment 
in  we issued a total of billion of long term notes with fixed coupon rates ranging from to 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the long term notes that were issued in to redeem all of our million long term notes due in with a fixed coupon rate of 
in  we also repurchased million of our long term notes through open market purchases and paid premiums of million in connection with the early extinguishments of certain long term notes 
capital structure  resources  and other at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of billion 
as of december   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries 
although those balances are generally available to fund ordinary business operations without legal or other restrictions  a significant portion is not immediately available to fund us operations unless repatriated 
our intention is to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
while we do not intend to do so  if this cash was repatriated at the end of  we estimate that about million of us federal income tax would have been due after considering foreign tax credits 

table of contents our long term debt  net of unamortized discounts  amounted to billion  and mainly is in the form of publicly issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements 
in august  we entered into a billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks and terminated our existing billion revolving credit facility that was to expire in june the credit facility expires august  and we may request and the banks may grant  at their discretion  an increase to the credit facility by an additional amount up to million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under either facility through december  borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based  at our option  on a eurodollar rate or a base rate  as defined in the credit facility 
each bank s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to  among other things  our compliance with various representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio  as defined in the credit facility 
the leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustments recognized in stockholders equity related to postretirement benefit plans 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility  as well as in our debt agreements 
we have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended december  if we were to issue commercial paper  the borrowings would be supported by the credit facility 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the us securities and exchange commission through august to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities 
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
we review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts  and maturities of our indebtedness 
we may at times refinance existing indebtedness  vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs 
our stockholders equity was million at december   a decrease of million from december  the decrease was due to the annual december re measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of billion  which was partially offset by the amortization of net actuarial gains and losses of million in  dividends declared of billion during the year  and the repurchase of million common shares for billion 
these decreases partially were offset by net earnings of billion and employee stock activity of million 
as we repurchase our common shares  we reduce common stock for the of par value of the shares repurchased  with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program  additional paid in capital was reduced to zero  with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of million recorded as a reduction of retained earnings 
if in the future we were to have a deficit in stockholders equity as a result of further adjustments associated with the funded status of postretirement benefit plans  the deficit would not affect our ability to comply with our debt covenants 
the debt related financial covenants in our revolving credit facility exclude the effect of adjustments to stockholders equity resulting from re measuring the funded status of postretirement plans 
in addition  as a maryland corporation  so long as we are able to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business  we anticipate that we would be able to pay dividends and make stock repurchases in an amount limited to our net earnings in either the current or the preceding fiscal year or from the net earnings for the preceding eight quarters 

table of contents contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had contractual commitments to repay debt  make payments under operating leases  settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services  and settle tax and other liabilities 
capital lease obligations were not material 
payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows in millions payments due by period total less than year years and years and after years long term debt a interest payments other liabilities operating lease obligations purchase obligations operating activities capital expenditures total contractual cash obligations a long term debt includes scheduled principal payments only 
amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long term liabilities recorded as of december  such amounts mainly include expected payments under non qualified pension plans  environmental liabilities  and deferred compensation plans 
purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages 
such agreements and contracts may  for example  be related to direct materials  obligations to subcontractors  and outsourcing arrangements 
total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our us government customers 
the us government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts for convenience under the far  subject to available funding 
this also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a us government contract 
the termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign  state  and local governments 
we also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions  including contracts with commercial customers 
purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts 
we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements  sometimes referred to as offset agreements  as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries 
these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country 
offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transferring technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  and the purchase by third parties eg  our vendors of supplies from in country vendors 
these agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in country vendors  providing financial support for in country projects  establishment of joint ventures with local companies  and building or leasing facilities for in country operations 
we typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive 
the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement 
at december   the remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled billion  which primarily relate to our aeronautics  mfc  and mst business segments  some of which extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at december  that also satisfy offset agreements  those amounts are included in the preceding table 
offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements 
while historically we have not been required to pay material penalties  resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments 
in connection with our ownership interest of ula  we and the boeing company boeing have each received distributions totaling million since ula s formation in december which are subject to agreements between us  boeing  and ula  whereby  if ula does not have sufficient cash resources or credit capacity to make payments under the 
table of contents inventory supply agreement it has with boeing  both we and boeing would provide to ula  in the form of an additional capital contribution  the level of funding required for ula to make those payments 
any such capital contributions would not exceed the amount of the distributions subject to the agreements 
we currently believe that ula will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity  including access to its million revolving credit agreement from third party financial institutions  to meet its obligations such that we would not be required to make a contribution under these agreements 
in addition  both we and boeing have cross indemnified each other for guarantees by us and boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ula under certain launch service contracts 
we believe ula will be able to fully perform its obligations  as it has done through december   and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross indemnities or guarantees 
we have entered into standby letters of credit  surety bonds  and third party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts 
letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform 
in some cases  we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners 
at december   we had the following outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds  and guarantees in millions commitment expiration by period total commitment less than year a years and a years and a after years standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total commitments a approximately million  million  and million of standby letters of credit in the less than year  years and  and years and  periods  and approximately million of surety bonds  are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation 
at december   third party guarantees totaled million  of which approximately related to guarantees of the contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party 
this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the joint venture partners 
in addition  we generally have cross indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner 
we believe our current and former joint venture partners will be able to perform their obligations  as they have done through december   and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees 
in determining our exposures  we evaluate the reputation  technical capabilities  and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners 
critical accounting policies contract accounting sales recognition substantially all of our net sales are accounted for using the poc method  which requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts 
our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide services to non us government customers  which we account for under the services accounting model 
we evaluate new or significantly modified contracts with customers other than the us government  to the extent the contracts include multiple elements  to determine if the individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting 
when we determine that accounting for the deliverables as separate units is appropriate  we allocate the contract value to the deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices 
the contracts or contract modifications we evaluate for multiple elements typically are long term in nature and include the provision of both products and services 
based on the nature of our business  we generally account for components of such contracts using the poc accounting model or the services accounting model  as appropriate 
we classify net sales as products or services on our statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the underlying contract 
most of our long term contracts are denominated in us dollars  including contracts for sales of military products and services to other governments conducted through the us government 
we record sales for both products and services under cost reimbursable  fixed price  and time and materials contracts 

table of contents contract types cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts  which accounted for about   and of our total net sales in   and  provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee  up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded 
we generate revenue under two general types of cost reimbursable contracts cost plus award fee incentive fee which represent a substantial majority of our cost reimbursable contracts  and cost plus fixed fee contracts 
cost plus award fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria  such as targets based on cost  quality  technical  and schedule criteria 
cost plus incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs incentive based on cost or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets incentive based on performance 
the fixed fee in a cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs 
fixed price and other contracts under fixed price contracts  which accounted for about   and of our total net sales in   and  we agree to perform the specified work for a pre determined price 
to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
some fixed price contracts have a performance based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance 
under time and materials contracts  which accounted for about of our total net sales in each of   and  we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended  and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out of pocket expenses 
to the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
poc method of accounting we record net sales and an estimated profit on a poc basis for cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts for product and services contracts with the us government 
the poc method for product contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract 
for example  for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantities  sales are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs 
for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development  we record sales and an estimated profit on a poc basis using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract 
for contracts to provide services to the us government  sales are generally recorded using the cost to cost method 
award and incentive fees  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on contracts accounted for under the poc method 
estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance 
we record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs 
accounting for contracts under the poc method requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract sales and costs including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts  the estimation of total sales and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor  and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
our estimates of costs at completion of the contract are based on assumptions we make for variables such as labor productivity and 
table of contents availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials  performance by our subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from our customer  among other variables 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 
many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements 
at the outset of a contract  we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical  schedule  and cost aspects of the contract  and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract 
the estimates consider the technical requirements for example  a newly developed product versus a mature product  the schedule and associated tasks for example  the number and type of milestone events  and costs for example  material  labor  subcontractor and overhead 
the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements  schedule  and costs in the initial estimated costs at completion 
profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical  schedule and costs aspects of the contract 
alternatively  our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated costs to complete the contract increase 
all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate 
in addition  comparability of our segment operating profit may be impacted by changes in estimated profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the poc method of accounting 
increases in the estimated profit booking rates  typically referred to as risk retirements  usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract 
conversely  conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the total estimated costs at completion and a reduction of the estimated profit booking rate 
increases or decreases in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such changes 
segment operating profit may also be impacted  favorably or unfavorably  by other matters such as the resolution of contractual matters  reserves for disputes  asset impairments and insurance recoveries  among others 
segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements  reductions of profit booking rates  or other matters are presented net of state income taxes 
services method of accounting under a fixed price service contract  we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss 
we record net sales under fixed price service contracts to non us government customers on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
for cost reimbursable contracts for services to non us government customers that provide for award and incentive fees  we record net sales as services are performed  exclusive of award and incentive fees 
award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable  generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer 
this approach results in the recognition of such fees at contractual intervals typically every six months throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications 
costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred 
other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  interest expense  and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and  therefore  not recoverable through sales 
in addition  we may enter into advance agreements with the us government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters 
for example  most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under far provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the us government 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with us government regulations by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 

table of contents postretirement benefit plans overview many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans  and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees collectively  postretirement benefit plans see note 
in recent years  we have taken certain actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results  including no longer offering a defined benefit pension plan to new  non represented employees starting in january over the last few years  we have negotiated similar changes with our union represented population and as a result substantially all represented employees hired after june do not participate in a defined benefit pension plan 
we have also made substantial cash contributions over the years to our defined benefit pension plans including billion in additionally  during lump settlement payments of million were made from the defined benefit pension trust to certain former employees who had not commenced receiving their vested benefit payments  and the corresponding benefit obligation that was released was million 
notwithstanding these actions  the impact of these plans and benefits on our gaap earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions  including interest rates  rates of return on plan assets  and other actuarial assumptions including expected rates of increase in future compensation levels  employee turnover and mortality  as well as the timing of funding 
we recognize on a plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under gaap as either an asset or a liability on our balance sheets 
there is a corresponding non cash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax benefits recorded as deferred tax assets  in stockholders equity 
the gaap funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan 
the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the future benefits to be paid to plan participants 
the present value is calculated using a discount rate that is determined at the end of each year 
historically low interest rates over the last few years have significantly increased our benefit obligation 
this has contributed to a lower funded status of our defined benefit pension plans as determined by gaap 
the funding of our pension plans is determined in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa  as amended by the pension protection act of ppa 
our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least  as determined by the ppa 
this erisa funded status is calculated on a different basis than under gaap 
the erisa liability does not reflect anticipated future pay increases for plan participants as required under gaap and is currently measured using a higher discount rate than for gaap  primarily due to the moving ahead for progress in the st century act of map which provides temporary funding relief due to the historically low interest rate environment 
by way of contrast  under erisa our plans are about funded at december  and  while for gaap our defined benefit pension plans are about funded at december  and the us government cost accounting standards cas governs the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the us government  including fms 
actuarial assumptions gaap requires that the amounts we record related to our plans be computed using actuarial valuations 
the primary year end assumptions used to determine the funded status and estimate postretirement benefit plan expense for the following calendar year are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and employee turnover and mortality for all postretirement benefit plans  funding levels  the expected rates of increase in future compensation levels for the participants in our defined benefit pension plans  and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans 
these assumptions we make impact both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year 
the difference between the long term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets as well as funding levels in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent years 
when reassessing these assumptions each year we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends 
we also have to consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
we selected as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at december  related to our defined benefit pension plans  compared to at the end of and at the end of we selected as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at december  related to our retiree medical plans  compared to at the end of and at the end of we evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate 
table of contents discount rate  including results from cash flow models  quoted rates from long term bond indices  and changes in long term bond rates over the past year 
as part of our evaluation  we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated aa or better that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows 
we concluded that was a reasonable estimate for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption at december   consistent with the rate used at december   and we used at december  the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested  or to be invested  to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation 
this assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns  the anticipated long term allocation of plan assets  the historical return data for the trust funds  plan expenses  and the potential to outperform market index returns 
the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption  but the average expected return over a long term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption 
as a result  changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate 
our stockholders equity has been reduced cumulatively by billion from the annual year end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans  inclusive of the december  adjustment of billion 
these non cash  after tax amounts primarily represent net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates and differences between actual experience and our actuarial assumptions  which will be amortized to expense over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately years 
during  million of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and billion is expected to be recognized as expense in if in the future we were to have a deficit in stockholders equity as a result of further adjustments associated with the funded status of postretirement benefit plans  the deficit would not affect our ability to comply with our debt covenants nor do we anticipate the deficit to hinder our ability to pay dividends and make stock repurchases as further described in the capital structure  resources  and other section above 
we expect that our pension expense will be billion  which is comparable to our pension expense 
an increase in the amortization of net actuarial gains and losses caused by the decrease in the discount rate mentioned above was offset by an increase in the expected dollar amount of return on plan assets primarily due to the billion of discretionary contributions to the qualified defined benefit plans in the fourth quarter of the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment 
a change of plus or minus basis points in the discount rate assumption at december   with all other assumptions held constant  would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately billion  which would result in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholders equity at the end of the year of approximately billion 
if the discount rate at december  that was used to compute the expected expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been basis points higher or lower  with all other assumptions held constant  the amount of expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption at december  that was used to compute the expected expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been basis points higher or lower  with all other assumptions held constant  the amount of expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million 
funding considerations the ppa became applicable to us and other large us defense contractors beginning in and had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions 
we made contributions related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of billion in  billion in  and billion in  inclusive of amounts in excess of our required contributions 
we recovered billion in  million in and million in as cas costs 
amounts funded under cas are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  including fms  and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales 
amounts contributed in excess of the cas funding requirements  over billion inclusive of interest as of december   are considered to be prepayment credits under the cas rules 
we would expect our required contributions to be temporarily lowered beginning in through as a result of map we expect to make contributions of billion related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in and anticipate recovering billion as cas cost on our contracts in the cas board published its revised pension accounting rules cas harmonization with an effective date of february  to better align the recovery of pension contributions  including prepayment credits  on us government 
table of contents contracts with the accelerated funding requirements of the ppa 
the cas harmonization rules increase our cas cost beginning in there is a transition period during which the cost impact of the new rules is phased in  with the full impact occurring in the incremental impact of cas harmonization in is a very modest cas cost increase  and we expect much larger increases will occur successively in years through based upon current assumptions which may change  we expect that the increase in cas costs caused by cas harmonization should result in increased earnings a few years from now  as our cas costs would be in excess of the pension expense we record under gaap 
accordingly  we expect our non cash fas cas pension adjustment  discussed further in the business segment results of operations section above  will soon increase earnings rather than decrease earnings as it has the past few years 
in addition  we expect that our future cas pension recoveries will soon be equal to or greater than our required pension contributions  which should increase our cash flow from operations 
environmental matters we are a party to various agreements  proceedings  and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues  including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the epa or by a state agency 
at december  and  the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was million and million 
we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december  and for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the us government  as discussed below 
the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non us government contracts or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under us government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales 
we project costs and recovery of costs over approximately years 
we enter into agreements eg  administrative orders  consent decrees that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation 
we also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation 
environmental cleanup activities usually span many years  which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to  for example  changing remediation technologies 
to determine the costs related to cleanup sites  we have to assess the extent of contamination  effects on natural resources  the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation  and evolving regulatory environmental standards 
we perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matters in note significant accounting policies and note legal proceedings  commitments  and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities  which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site 
we do not discount the recorded liabilities  as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined 
given the required level of judgment and estimation  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination 
both the epa and the california office of environmental health hazard assessment announced plans in january to regulate two chemicals  perchlorate and hexavalent chromium  to levels in drinking water that are expected to be substantially lower than the existing public health goals or standards established in california 
the rulemaking processes are lengthy and may take years to complete 
if substantially lower standards are adopted  we would expect a material increase in our estimates for remediation at several existing sites 
under agreements reached with the us government  most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs 
under existing government regulations  these and other environmental expenditures relating to our us government business  after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services 
as a result  most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to us government agreement or regulation  regardless of the contract form eg cost reimbursable  fixed price 
we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing  among other factors  us government regulations  our us government business base and contract mix  and our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs 
as disclosed above  we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites  which would result in a change to the corresponding 
table of contents environmental receivable and a charge to earnings 
for example  if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by million  the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately million  with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings 
this allocation is determined annually  based upon our existing and projected business activities with the us government 
we reasonably cannot determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved 
there are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation 
in some cases  although a loss may be probable  it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties eg  assessing the extent of the contamination 
during any particular quarter  such uncertainties may be resolved  allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site 
the amount of the liability could be material 
upon recognition of the liability  a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings 
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp  we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation 
under existing environmental laws  responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps 
the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps  which we are required to pursue by agreement and us government regulation 
goodwill our goodwill balances were billion and billion at december  and we test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions  changes in the business climate of our industry  a decline in our market capitalization  operating performance indicators  competition  reorganizations of our business  or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit 
our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit  which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment 
the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires judgment to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results 
we initially test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations  allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels as well as goodwill 
the corporate allocations include our postretirement benefit plans liabilities as determined in accordance with cas in order to align the basis of the carrying values with the fair values of our reporting units 
cas expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts and  therefore  is allocated to and recognized in the estimated fair value of each reporting unit 
the discount rate used for cas is currently higher than the discount rate used for gaap  but is expected to trend downward over the next few years and would increase the amount of cas liabilities allocated to each reporting unit  contributing to a decline in the carrying value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodologies such as comparable public trading values and values observed in market transactions 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments  including judgments about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  discount rates  perpetual growth rates  and relevant comparable company earnings multiples and transaction multiples 
the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions  changes in working capital  long term business plans  and recent operating performance 
the 
table of contents discount rates utilized in the dcf analysis are based on our weighted average cost of capital wacc  which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit 
in the fourth quarter of we tested goodwill for impairment for each of our reporting units  including the reporting units of our former electronic systems business segment and the reporting units of our new mfc and mst business segments 
the results of our annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and  as such  no impairment existed 
the fair value of each reporting unit was premised on the assumption that sequestration does not occur as it remains difficult to determine when and how sequestration would be implemented  that the us government continues to support and fund our programs  which is consistent with the continuing resolution funding measure through march   and that congress approves defense budget legislation for the us government s fiscal year at a level consistent with the president s proposed defense budget for the second half of the us government s fiscal year while the specific effects of sequestration cannot be determined  we expect that across the board reductions would cause our sales  profits  and cash flows to be lower than our current projections 
such circumstances could eventually result in an impairment of our goodwill 
certain of our businesses with smaller  short term contracts are the most susceptible to the impacts of budget reductions  such as our is gs business segment and certain services businesses within our mfc and mst business segments 
however  we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk of failing a goodwill impairment test in the near term  as their fair values are significantly greater than their carrying values 
impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding assumptions about expected future sales  profits  and cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
income taxes we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as from operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 
future changes in tax law could significantly impact the provision for income taxes  the amount of taxes payable  and the deferred tax asset and liability balances 
recent proposals to lower the us corporate income tax rate would require us to reduce our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of the related tax legislation  with a corresponding material  one time increase to income tax expense  but our income tax expense and payments would be materially reduced in subsequent years 
our net deferred tax assets as of december  and were billion and billion  based on a federal statutory income tax rate  and primarily relate to our postretirement benefit plans 
if the federal statutory income tax rate had been lowered to at december   our net deferred tax assets would have been reduced by billion  and we would have recorded a corresponding  one time increase in income tax expense of billion 
the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors  including the annual re measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations and actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted a new accounting standard during  which resulted only in a change in how we present other comprehensive loss in our consolidated financial statements and did not have any impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
for more information  see the recent accounting pronouncements section within note significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions 
we believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business 
we continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of  and access to  sufficient credit resources 
our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and market prices on certain equity securities 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate long term debt 
as bond yields are at historical lows and move inversely to bond prices  the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was billion at december   and the outstanding principal amount was billion  excluding unamortized discounts of million 
a change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at december  we use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges 
we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities 
for fixed rate borrowings  we may use variable interest rate swaps  effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid 
these swaps are designated as fair value hedges 
for variable rate borrowings  we may use fixed interest rate swaps  effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings 
these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges 
we may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting  which are intended to mitigate economic exposures 
the classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items  or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges  or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges  if any  are immediately recognized in earnings 
the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts at december  and was billion and billion 
the aggregate notional amount of our interest rate swap contracts at december  and was million and million 
at december  and  the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material note 
a appreciation or devaluation of the hedged currency as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract at december  would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our cash flows 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed 
our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks 
we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non qualified deferred compensation plans 
as of december   investments in the trust totaled million and are reflected at fair value on our balance sheet in other noncurrent assets 
the trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates 
a portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices 
changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust 
both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our statements of earnings in other unallocated costs  and were not material for the year ended december
