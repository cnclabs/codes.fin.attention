item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in we develop and market telecommunications services for internet protocol  or ip  telephony and video applications as well as web based conferencing and unified communications services 
we offer the x virtual office hosted pbx service  x virtual contact center service  the x virtual office pro unified communications solution and x cloud based computing solutions 
as of march   we had more than  business customers 
each business customer subscribes to a number of various lines and services eg physical phone extensions  contact center seats  virtual extensions  fax lines  toll free numbers  receptionist software  unified communications services  etc since fiscal  substantially all of our revenues have been generated from the sale  license and provision of voip products  services and technology 
prior to fiscal  our focus was on our voip semiconductor business 
critical accounting policies estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  valuation of inventories  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included above under part i  item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under the terms of our typical subscription agreement  new customers can terminate their service within days of order placement and receive a full refund of fees previously paid 
we have determined that we have sufficient history of subscriber conduct to make a reasonable estimate of cancellations within the day trial period 
therefore  we recognize new subscriber revenue in the month in which the new order was shipped  net of an allowance for expected cancellations 
financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria 
in addition  arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with certain limitations 
the provisioning of the x service with the accompanying x ip telephone constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with the guidance of asc  we allocate x revenues  including activation fees  among the x ip telephones and subscriber services based on the fair value determined by their relative selling prices 
revenues allocated to these devices are recognized as product revenues during the period of the sale less the allowance for estimated returns during the day trial period 
all other revenues are recognized when the related services are provided 
we record revenue net of any sales related taxes that are billed to our customers 
we believe this approach results in consolidated financial statements that are more easily understood by investors 
the cost of the products sold is recognized contemporaneously with the recognition of product revenue 
at the time of each revenue transaction  we assess whether the revenue amount is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we defer recognition of revenue on product sales to retailers where the right of return exists until products are resold to the end user and the trial period has expired 
under our revenue recognition accounting principles  if a software license arrangement includes acceptance criteria  we do not recognize revenue until we can demonstrate objectively that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or that the customer has signed formal acceptance documentation 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  we recognize revenue on a subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
for all sales  except those completed via the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or other signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement  and recognize revenue upon settlement of the transaction  if there are no customer acceptance conditions 
we do not settle credit card transactions until equipment related to the transaction  if any  is shipped to a customer 
our ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed above under item a  risk factors 
collectability of accounts receivable we must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of march   the accounts receivable balance was  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  including a reserve for disputed credits  and an estimated returns reserve of  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and replacement costs 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income and other taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax expense and to assess temporary differences resulting from book tax accounting differences for items such as accrued vacation 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required to determine the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset and concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we released most of our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset which resulted in a credit to the income statement of approximately million 
we determined that a release of a portion of our valuation allowance was appropriate as a result of the following discrete events our attainment of three consecutive years of net income  the acquisition of contactual in the second quarter of fiscal  the completion of the section ownership analysis under the internal revenue code for contactual in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset and concluded that an additional allowance was needed 
therefore  we increased our valuation allowance related to our state net operating loss and tax credit carryovers which resulted in a debit to the income statement of approximately million 
we determined that an increase in our valuation allowance was appropriate as a result of the change in the net income apportionment methodology in california 
in making this determination  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including our recent earnings trend and expected continued future taxable income 
as of march   the net deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet represented the projected tax benefit we expect to realize 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against the remainder of our deferred tax assets that we believe we will not be able to utilize 
we have received inquiries  demands or audit requests from several state  municipal and taxing agencies seeking payment of taxes that are applied to or collected from the customers of providers of traditional public switched telephone network services 
we recorded no expense for the years ended march   and for estimated tax exposure for such assessments 
stock based compensation we account for our employee stock options  stock purchase rights and restricted stock units granted under the stock plan  director option plan  nonstatutory stock option plan  the stock plan  the contactual plan  the equity incentive plan and stock purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plan collectively equity compensation plans under the provisions of asc stock compensation 
under the provisions of asc  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant  net of estimated forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income for fiscal  and  was measured based on asc criteria 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized using the straight line single option method and includes the impact of estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
to value option grants  stock purchase rights and restricted stock units under the equity compensation plans for actual and pro forma stock based compensation we used the black scholes option valuation model 
fair value determined using the black scholes option valuation model varies based on assumptions used for the expected stock prices volatility  expected life  risk free interest rates and future dividend payments 
for fiscal years  and  we used the historical volatility of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the options to their fair value 
the expected life assumptions represent the weighted average period stock based awards are expecting to remain outstanding 
these expected life assumptions were established through the review of historical exercise behavior of stock based award grants with similar vesting periods 
the risk free interest was based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded us treasury securities in the over the counter market for the expected term equal to the expected term of the option 
the dividend yield assumption was based on our history and expectation of future dividend payout 
asc requires us to calculate the additional paid in capital pool apic pool available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting asc  as if we had adopted asc at its effective date of january  there are two allowable methods to calculate our apic pool the long form method or the short form method as set forth in asc we have elected to use the long form method under which we track each award grant on an employee by employee basis and grant by grant basis to determine if there is a tax benefit or tax deficiency for such award 
we then compared the fair value expense to the tax deduction received for each grant and aggregated the benefits and deficiencies to establish the apic pool 
due to the adoption of asc  some option exercises result in tax deductions in excess book deductions based on the option value at the time of grant 
we recognize these windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
we use the with and without approach as described in asc  in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefits only after all other tax attributes of ours have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation 
also  we have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share based compensation deductions in computing our research and development tax credits and alternative tax credits and as such  we recognize the full effect of these deductions in the consolidated income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs 
selected operating statistics we periodically review certain key business metrics  within the context of our articulated performance goals  in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
the selected operating statistics include the following selected operating statistics march  dec  sept 
 june  march  gross business customer additions     number of new services sold    average number of subscribed services per new business customer business subscriber acquisition cost per service total business customers     average number of subscribed services per business customer business customer average monthly service revenue per customer business customer churn less cancellations within days of sign up business service revenue churn overall service margin overall product margin overall gross margin does not include customers of virtual office solo or zerigo  inc zerigo 
number of recurring revenue services sold to business customers during the period 
number of new services sold divided by gross business customer additions 
the combined costs of advertising  marketing  promotions  sales commissions and equipment subsidies for new services sold during the period divided by the number of new services sold during the period 
business customers are defined as customers paying for service 
customers that are currently in the day trial period are considered to be customers that are paying for service 
customers subscribing to virtual office solo or zerigo services are not included as business customers 
the simple average number of subscribed services divided by the simple average number of business customers during the period 
the simple average number of subscribed services is the number of subscribed services on the first day of the period plus the number of subscribed services on the last day of the period divided by two 
the simple average number of business customers is the number of business customers on the first day of the period plus the number of business customers on the last day of the period divided by two 
business customer average monthly service revenue per customer is service revenue from business customers in the period divided by the number of months in the period divided by the simple average number of business customers during the period 
business customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of business customers that terminated after the expiration of the day trial by the simple average number of business customers and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
in the second quarter of fiscal  an affiliate with business customers representing approximately  of monthly service revenue cancelled service 
excluding these cancellations  business customer churn less cancellations within days of sign up was 
we believe it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually  as we do not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
we have minimal seasonality in our business but typically sales of new subscriptions in our fourth fiscal quarter are greater than any of the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
we believe this occurs because the customers we target have a tendency to spend a greater portion of their annual capital budgets at the beginning of the calendar year rather than the last three quarters of the year

we recognized a gain of slightly less than million  net of transaction costs  in the first fiscal quarter of and approximately million in the fourth fiscal quarter of due to the third party purchaser entering into a license agreement with its customer 
the gain on patent sale has been recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income

income on change in fair value of warrant liability years ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands income on change in fair value of warrant liability n a percentage of total revenue in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock in fiscal and  we issued warrants in three different equity financings 
the income on change in fair value of the warrant liability in fiscal is due to the partial exercise and expiration of all remaining warrants in the third quarter of fiscal provision benefit for income taxes years ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands provision benefit for income taxes   percentage of total revenue we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal year of which million related to net income from operations  including the sale of patent under our patent purchase agreement  and million due to an increase in our valuation allowance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset and determined that an additional million was needed for certain net operating loss carryovers that may expire before utilization 
therefore  we increased the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset which resulted in a debit to the consolidated income statement of approximately million 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  primarily related to the release of million of our valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the release of million of our valuation allowance due to the acquisition of zerigo in the first fiscal quarter of partially offset by million of state income tax expense 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets with the exception of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we released a significant portion of our valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  differed from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily because we utilized prior net operating losses and available tax credits when we had a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
therefore  our income tax provision consisted primarily of minimum and capital state income taxes and foreign income tax 
as of march   we provided a full valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets as we believed the objective and verifiable evidence of our historical pre tax net losses outweighed the existing positive evidence regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  that expire at various dates beginning in and continuing through in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in continuing through  while the california credit will carry forward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited in certain circumstances 
at march  and  we had net deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of approximately million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and investments 
by comparison  at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the foreseeable future

please refer to part i  item a  risk factors we may need to raise additional capital to support our future operations 
to net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared with million provided by operating activities for fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the sale of patent under our patent purchase agreement million and use of our deferred tax assets to reduce our cash taxes due million 
cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income  sales of subscriptions  changes in working capital accounts  particularly in deferred revenue due to timing of annual plan renewals  add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization  and the expense associated with stock based awards 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million used in investing activities in fiscal the increase in cash used in investing activities during fiscal is primarily related to the purchase of additional equipment and leasehold improvements related to our new facility million offset by a reduction in cash used to purchase businesses in fiscal million

the use of cash in financing activities in fiscal was partially offset by million in cash provided by the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan  as well as the issuance of restricted shares 
contractual obligations future operating lease payments  capital lease payments and purchase obligations at march  for the next five years were as follows in thousands year ending march  total capital leases office leases      purchase obligations third party customer support provider  third party network service providers   open purchase orders we lease our headquarters facility in san jose  california under an operating lease agreement that expires in october the lease is an industrial net lease with monthly base rent of  for the first months with a increase each year thereafter  and requires us to pay property taxes  utilities and normal maintenance costs 
in the third quarter of  we amended our contract with one of our third party customer support vendors containing a minimum monthly commitment of approximately  the agreement requires a day notice to terminate 
at march   the total remaining obligation under the contract was million 
we entered into contracts with multiple vendors for third party network service providers which expire on various dates in fiscal through at march   the total remaining obligations under these contracts were million 
at march   we had open purchase orders of  primarily related to inventory purchases from our contract manufacturers 
these purchase commitments are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods or services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
during the years ended march  and  we did not have any outstanding debt instruments other than equipment under capital leases and  therefore  we were not exposed to market risk relating to interest rates
