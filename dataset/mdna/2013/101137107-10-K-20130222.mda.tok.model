table of contents the following are the components of our worldwide crm net sales year ended year ended in millions december  december  us international total us international total icd systems pacemaker systems crm products the reduction in our crm net sales during as compared to  is primarily due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental  competitive and other pricing pressures  and lower procedural volumes as a result of continued contraction in the us icd market due to a variety of factors  including physician reaction to study results published by the journal of the american medical association in prior years regarding evidence based guidelines for icd implants  us department of justice doj investigations into hospitals icd implant practices and the expansion of medicare recovery audits  as well as on going physician alignment to hospitals 
in addition  our sales levels related to replacement procedures were lower than the prior year due to historical product recalls and subsequent reductions in our denovo first time icd implants following these recalls 
however  we believe that our us denovo icd share increased throughout as a result of our incepta and energen line of defibrillators launched in the fourth quarter of  and our highly reliable reliance lead platform 
in the first half of  we launched our ingenio family of pacemaker systems in the us and emea  and in july  we received ce mark approval for use of our ingenio and advantio pacemakers in patients in need of a magnetic resonance imaging mri scan  which we believe represents a significant advancement to our family of pacemaker devices 
in the second quarter of  we received fda approval for our invive cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers crt ps 
during the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of cameron health  inc cameron 
cameron developed the world first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator the s icd system  which we believe is a differentiated technology that will provide us the opportunity to both increase our market share in the existing icd market and expand that market over time 
the s icd system has received ce mark approval and is available in emea 
in september we received fda approval for the s icd system and commenced a limited commercial launch in the united states 
we believe these recent product developments will help to better position us within the crm market 
net sales from our crm products represent a significant source of our overall net sales 
therefore  increases or decreases in our crm net sales could have a significant impact on our results of our consolidated operations 
variables that may impact the size of the crm market and or our share of that market include  but are not limited to the on going impact of physician alignment to hospitals  government investigations and audits of hospitals  and other market and economic conditions on the overall number of procedures performed and average selling prices  our ability to retain and attract key members of our crm sales force and other key crm personnel  the ability of crm manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community  the referring physician community and prospective patients in crm technologies  future product field actions or new physician advisories issued by us or our competitors  our ability to timely and successfully acquire or develop and launch new or next generation competitive products and technologies worldwide  in line with our commercialization strategies  including the s icd system  new product launches by our competitors  variations in clinical results  reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products  and delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge  primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market and related adjustments to our business  and other competitive factors  which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts 
additionally  during the second quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to our emea business 
the emea goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by our revised projections for revenue growth in emea which were slightly lower than our previous estimates  which was primarily due to macro economic factors and our performance in the european market

emerging markets as part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion  described in item of this annual report  we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence 
in particular  we are focusing our efforts and increasing our investment in certain countries whose economies and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly  in order to maximize opportunities in those countries 
we significantly increased sales in brazil  russia  india and china and continued investments in infrastructure in those countries  as well as others  in and throughout as a result of these efforts  during  we experienced double digit sales growth in these markets  as compared to we recently created a new asia pacific regional organization under new leadership to further increase our capabilities and strengthen our position in this fast growing region 
restructuring initiatives on an on going basis  we monitor the dynamics of the economy  the healthcare industry  and the markets in which we compete  and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency  and better alignment of expenses with revenues  while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects  capital and our people that are essential to our long term success 
as a result of these assessments  we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long term success 
these initiatives are described below  and additional information can be found in results of operations and note h restructuring related activities to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
restructuring plan on july   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a restructuring initiative the restructuring plan designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies  increase competitiveness and support new investments  thereby increasing shareholder value 
the original estimate of the plan was a reduction of annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately million to million exiting  a substantial portion of which is expected to be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth  including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets 
key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities  relocating select administrative and functional activities  rationalizing organizational reporting structures  leveraging preferred vendors  and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency 
among these efforts  we are expanding our ability to deliver best in class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets 
this action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost reducing and productivity enhancing opportunities 
in addition  we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions  eliminate bureaucracy  increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies 
on january   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  an expansion of our restructuring program the expansion 
the expansion is intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments  which we expect to increase shareholder value 
we estimate that the expansion will reduce gross annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately million to million exiting  and that the total restructuring program  including the expansion the total program  will reduce gross annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately million to million exiting we expect a substantial portion of the total program savings to be reinvested in targeted areas for future growth  including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets 
key activities under the expansion include further initiatives to standardize and automate certain processes and activities  relocate select administrative and functional activities  rationalize organizational reporting structures  expand shared services  and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions 
in addition  they include further efforts to streamline various corporate functions  eliminate bureaucracy  increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies 
key activities under the total program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of restructuring plan on february   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives the restructuring plan designed to focus our business  drive innovation  accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value 
key activities under the plan included the restructuring of certain of our businesses and corporate functions  the re alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets  and the reprioritization and diversification of 
table of contents our product portfolio 
activities under the restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of and were completed by the end of  and resulted in gross reductions in pre tax operating expenses of approximately million 
a portion of these savings were reinvested into customer facing positions and other commercial resources and infrastructure 
plant network optimization in january  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plant network optimization program  intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities 
the program was a complement to our restructuring plan  and was intended to improve overall gross profit margins 
the program has resulted in annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately million exiting these savings are in addition to the million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our restructuring plan 
activities under the plant network optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of and were substantially completed during neurovascular divestiture in january  we closed the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker corporation for a purchase price of billion in cash 
we received billion during  million during  and will receive an additional million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities  which we expect will occur during we are providing transitional services through a transition services agreement  and are also manufacturing and supplying products to stryker through a supply agreement 
these transition services and supply arrangements are expected to end in we recorded revenue of million during related to this divested business as compared to million during and million of sales of neurovascular and other divested product lines in our sales related to divested businesses will continue to decline as the various transition services and supply agreements terminate in see results of operations and note c divestitures and assets held for sale for additional information 
healthcare reform the patient protection and affordable care act and health care and education affordability reconciliation act were enacted into law in the us in certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood  therefore  it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law 
the legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a percent excise tax on us sales of class i  ii and iii medical devices beginning in january we intend to record this tax within our selling  general and administrative expenses and expect that our excise tax liability for will be up to million 
other provisions of this law  including medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs  comparative effectiveness research  an independent payment advisory board  and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies  could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered  and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases 
any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
further  we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level  or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the us or internationally 

table of contents results of operations net sales as of december   we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions the united states  emea  consisting of europe  the middle east and africa  japan  and inter continental  consisting of our asia pacific and the americas operating segments  which include the emerging markets of brazil  china and india 
the reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment 
we manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis  and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level 
management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance 
to calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to us dollars using standard currency exchange rates 
the regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in note o segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
the following tables provide our worldwide net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis 
we have restated regional net sales for and to exclude sales from our former neurovascular business  which we sold to stryker corporation in january  and present net sales from this business within divested businesses in the tables below 
net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a replacement for  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure

gross profit our gross profit was billion in  billion in  and billion in as a percentage of net sales  our gross profit increased to percent in  as compared to percent in and percent in the following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period year ended december  gross profit prior year promus supply true up neurovascular divestiture manufacturing cost reductions transition related inventory charges credits all other  including other inventory charges  other period expense and net impact of foreign currency sales mix and pricing gross profit current year the increase in our gross profit margin for  as compared to  is primarily the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and other process improvement programs 
our gross margin was negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices related primarily to sales of our drug eluting stent and crm products  however  these declines were largely offset by the full conversion to our internally developed and self manufactured next generation promus element stent system during our promus element stent system has significantly higher gross margins than the prior generation promus stent system  which was supplied to us by abbott laboratories 
additionally  affecting our year over year comparison of year to date gross margin was the impact of a one time million credit to cost of products sold  related to a two year retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott and product transition related inventory charges of million recorded in  discussed further below 

table of contents the primary factor contributing to the decrease in our gross profit margin during  as compared to  was the negative impact of lower sales of neurovascular products and at significantly lower gross profit margins as result of the divestiture of our neurovascular business 
in addition  we recognized transition related inventory charges of million in  primarily related to promus excess inventory and purchase commitments as a result of our fourth quarter launch of our internally developed and self manufactured next generation promus element stent system in the us the decreases in were partially offset by the positive impact of a million credit to cost of products sold recognized in the first quarter of  related to a two year retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems 
declines in average selling prices of our products  particularly our drug eluting stent systems  were offset by the positive impact of product mix related to sales of our drug eluting stent systems  as we began shifting sales to our internally developed and manufactured stent systems with more favorable gross profit margins during in addition  our gross profit margin in was negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us crm business 
we are subject to a final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our promus supply arrangement with abbott for historical purchases of promus stent systems 
we may record a one time benefit or charge to our gross profit in the future as a result of this adjustment process 
operating expenses the following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses year ended december  of net of net of net in millions sales sales sales selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses royalty expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in  our sg a expenses increased million  or two percent  as compared to  and were basis points higher as a percentage of net sales 
this increase was driven primarily by continued investments in acquisitions and in commercial resources and infrastructure for global expansion  particularly in emerging markets  and a non recurring asset impairment charge as a result of a program termination 
also contributing to the year over year increase was a benefit recorded in as a result of a reversal of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against long outstanding receivables in greece 
these increases in sg a were partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
beginning in january  as a result of new legislation  all medical device manufacturers will be subject to a percent excise tax on us sales of class i  ii and iii medical devices 
we intend to record this tax within our selling  general and administrative expenses and expect that our excise tax liability for will be up to million 
in  our sg a expenses decreased million  or four percent  as compared to  and were basis points lower as a percentage of net sales 
our sg a expenses were lower in  as compared to  as a result of the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker in january and lower expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and cost containment discipline 
in addition  our sg a expenses for benefited from the reversal of million of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against long outstanding receivables in greece in these receivables had previously been fully reserved as we had determined that they had a high risk of being uncollectible due to the economic situation in greece 
during the first quarter of  the greek government converted these receivables into bonds  which we were able to monetize  reducing our allowance for doubtful accounts as a credit to sg a expense 
these decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as well as additional sg a expenses related to acquisitions and global expansion initiatives 
research and development r d expenses in  our r d expenses decreased million  or approximately one percent  as compared to  and were basis points higher as a percentage of net sales 
the slight decrease in overall spending in was due to continued focus on cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient  partially offset by increased r d funding for our acquisitions 
we remain committed 
table of contents to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth 
in  our r d expenses decreased million  or approximately five percent  as compared to  and were basis points lower as a percentage of net sales 
the decrease in was due to the elimination of spending related to our neurovascular business and cost reductions associated with our restructuring programs 
royalty expense in  our royalty expense decreased million  or percent  as compared to  and was basis points lower as a percentage of net sales 
the decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royalty bearing products within our interventional cardiology business 
in  our royalty expense decreased million  or seven percent  as compared to  and was slightly lower as a percentage of net sales 
the decrease relates primarily to royalty expense attributable to neurovascular products which was eliminated with the sale of our neurovascular business in january these royalties represented million of expense in amortization expense our amortization expense was million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of million or six percent 
this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of this non cash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 
amortization expense was million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or percent 
this decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of guidant corporation in reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of goodwill impairment charges charges we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in the second quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our emea reporting unit was impaired and recorded a billion billion after tax charge in the second quarter of we finalized the second step of the emea goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of  in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization 
in the third quarter of  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a non cash million pre and after tax charge associated with our us crm reporting unit  primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the us crm market  related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors  which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts 
we finalized the second step of the us crm goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of  in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization 
in our goodwill impairment tests we used the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow dcf method  to derive the fair value of our emea and us crm reporting units  as described in our accounting policies 
we updated all aspects of the dcf models associated with the emea and us crm businesses  including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates and the appropriate market participant risk adjusted weighted average costs of capital wacc to apply 
emea as a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter  we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the emea reporting unit would be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macro economic factors and our performance in the european market 
we updated short term operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for emea prepared by management 
we reduced the emea long term growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our year dcf model for emea by approximately basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of the economic uncertainty in europe 
while we continue to 
table of contents project revenue growth in our emea business  our expectations for future growth and profitability were lower than our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures 
the declines expected in the emea market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units 
the aggregate amount of goodwill that remains associated with our emea reporting unit is million as of december  in addition  the remaining book value of our other emea intangible assets allocated to our emea reporting unit is approximately billion as of december  in accordance with asc topic  we tested our emea amortizable intangible assets as of april  for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis  and determined that these assets were not impaired 
we also tested our indefinite lived intangible assets associated with emea as of april  and recorded an impairment charge related to the in process research and development associated with our acquisition of sadra medical  inc see intangible asset impairment charges below for a further discussion of this impairment 
us crm the us crm market is dynamic  highly competitive and difficult to forecast  in the third quarter of  we lowered our projections for the us crm market size and our future revenue levels within this market  primarily to reflect recent changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth  adjustments to our business and other competitive factors 
this reduction warranted an interim goodwill impairment test for our us crm reporting unit 
the declines expected in the us crm market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units 
the increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes are primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals  efforts to reduce health care costs  focus on appropriate device usage  replacement volumes and competition  and have been more impactful to the us crm business than previously estimated 
in addition  we recently aligned certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return 
as a result of these factors  we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our year dcf model for the us crm reporting unit by approximately basis points 
we continue to analyze business trends using all available information and our us crm goodwill remains sensitive to changes in expectations of future growth of this market and our performance 
based on the remaining book value of our us crm reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of  the carrying value of our us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value  due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit 
the remaining book value of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to the us crm reporting unit was approximately billion as of december  in accordance with asc topic  we tested the amortizable intangible assets as of september   in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our us crm reporting unit 
we performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis  and concluded that these assets were not impaired 
however  following the recent declines in our crm projections  the recoverability of our crm related amortizable intangibles billion globally are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance 
the billion of crm related amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods 
an impairment of a material portion of our crm related amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period 
we continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods 
these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit  which holds million of remaining allocated goodwill  our us cardiovascular reporting unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  and our us neuromodulation reporting unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  each as of december  as of december   the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit  whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven to percent 
during the fourth quarter of  the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance  declines in our market share due to competitive launches  and continued average selling price declines in the us drug eluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes 
on a quarterly basis  we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets 
the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability 
terminal value growth rate assumptions  as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows 
these assumptions are subject to uncertainty  including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels 
relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges 
for example  keeping all other variables constant  a basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit 
a basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would 
table of contents require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit 
an increase in the wacc applied of basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units 
given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value  any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period 
the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management best estimates  which we believe to be reasonable  but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances 
future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units and or amortizable intangible assets include  but are not limited to decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater than expected declines in procedural volumes  pricing pressures  product actions  and or competitive technology developments  declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition  an inability to develop or launch new and next generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies  and market and or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls  decreases in our profitability due to an inability to successfully implement and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations  increases in our market participant tax rate  and or changes in tax laws  negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products  the level of success of on going and future research and development efforts  including those related to recent acquisitions  and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products  the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies  achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations  establishing government and third party payer reimbursement  and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully  changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses  increases in our market participant risk adjusted wacc  and declines in revenue as a result of loss of key members of our sales force and other key personnel 
negative changes in one or more of these factors  among others  could result in additional impairment charges 
charge based on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of  we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the us icd market  which led to lower projected us crm results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm business unit 
therefore  we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a non deductible goodwill impairment charge of million  on both a pre tax and after tax basis  associated with this business unit during the first quarter of charge as a result of ship hold and product removal actions associated with our us icd and crt d products  which we announced on march   and the forecasted corresponding financial impact on our operations we concluded there was an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our us crm reporting unit during the first quarter of therefore  we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with us gaap and our accounting policies and recorded a non deductible goodwill impairment charge of billion  on both a pre tax and after tax basis  associated with our us crm reporting unit 
goodwill impairment charges do not impact our debt covenants or our cash flows  and are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 

table of contents intangible asset impairment charges on a quarterly basis  we monitor for events or other potential indicators of impairment that would warrant an interim impairment test of our intangible assets 
charges during the third quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test of all in process research and development projects  and our indefinite lived core technology assets 
based on the results of our annual test  we recorded total impairment charges of million to write down the balances of certain in process projects to their fair value 
these charges were primarily due to increased expectations in the cost to bring an in process project to market in a certain geographic region and lower future revenue expectations associated with an in process project 
following the recent declines in our crm projections  the recoverability of our crm related amortizable intangibles billion globally are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our crm business performance 
the billion of crm related amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods 
an impairment of a material portion of our crm related amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period 
see goodwill impairment charges above for discussion of future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units and or amortizable intangible assets 
during the second quarter of  as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test  we performed an interim impairment test of our in process research and development projects associated with our acquisition of sadra medical  inc based on our impairment analysis  we revised our expectations of the required effort  time and cost involved in completing the in process projects and bringing the related products to market 
as a result of these changes  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of charges during the third quarter of  we recorded a million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the timing and amount of the expected cash flows related to certain purchased research and development projects 
charges during the first quarter of  due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our peripheral interventions technology offerings  as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this technology  we lowered our sales forecasts associated with a product 
in addition  during the third quarter of  as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio  we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success 
as a result of these factors  we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded a million charge in the first quarter of  and a million charge in the third quarter of to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value 
intangible asset impairment charges are non cash charges that are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity 
contingent consideration expense certain of our acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements 
payment of additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones  including attaining specified revenue levels  achieving product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals 
in accordance with us gaap  we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date 
we re measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates  as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory  revenue or commercialization based milestones 

table of contents we recorded a net benefit related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of million in and net expenses of million in and million in contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating performance

acquisition related milestone in connection with abbott laboratories acquisition of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses  abbott agreed to pay us a milestone payment of million upon receipt of an approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare mhlw to market the xience v stent system in japan 
the mhlw approved the xience v stent system in the first quarter of and we received the milestone payment from abbott  which we recorded as a million pre tax gain 
this non recurring acquisition related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance 
restructuring charges and restructuring related activities restructuring plan on july   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a restructuring initiative the restructuring plan designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies  increase competitiveness and support new investments  thereby increasing shareholder value 
the original estimate of the plan was a reduction of annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately million to million exiting  a substantial portion of which is expected to be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth  including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets 
key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities  relocating select administrative and functional activities  rationalizing organizational reporting structures  leveraging preferred vendors  and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency 
among these efforts  we are expanding our ability to deliver best in class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets 
this action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost reducing and productivity enhancing opportunities 
in addition  we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions  eliminate bureaucracy  increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies 
on january   our board of directors approved  and we committed to  an expansion of the restructuring program the expansion 
the expansion is intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments  which we expect to increase stockholder value 
we estimate that the expansion will reduce gross annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately million to million exiting  and that the total restructuring plan  including the expansion total program  will reduce gross annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately million to million exiting we expect a substantial portion of the total program savings to be reinvested in targeted areas for future growth  including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets 
key activities under the expansion include further initiatives to standardize and automate certain processes and activities  relocate select administrative and functional activities  rationalize organizational reporting structures  expand shared services  and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions 
in addition  they include further efforts to streamline various corporate functions  eliminate bureaucracy  increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies

plant network optimization program in january  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plant network optimization initiative the plant network optimization program  intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities 
the program was a complement to the restructuring initiatives approved by our board of directors in the restructuring plan  and was intended to improve overall gross profit margins 
the program has resulted in annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately million exiting these savings are in addition to the million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our restructuring plan 
activities under the plant network optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of and were substantially completed during we expect that the execution of the plant network optimization program will result in total pre tax charges of approximately million to million  and that approximately million to million of these charges will result in cash outlays  of which we had made payments of million to date

tax rate the following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate year ended december  reported tax rate impact of certain receipts charges these receipts charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
the change in our reported tax rate for  as compared to and  relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
in  these receipts and charges include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  acquisition and divestiture related net credits  and litigation and restructuring related charges 
our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from an unfavorable court ruling 
in addition  the decrease in the tax rate excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in as compared to is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business 
in  these receipts and charges included a gain on our divestiture of the neurovascular business  a non deductible goodwill impairment charge  other intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring  litigation and acquisition related charges and credits 
our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items  related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets  changes in various state tax laws  the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the internal revenue service irs  the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions  and the finalization of our us federal tax return 
in  these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisition related milestone payment  and restructuring related charges 
in  our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items  related primarily to the re measurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third party case and the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third party case 
we have received notices of deficiency from the irs reflecting proposed audit adjustments for guidant corporation for its through tax years and boston scientific corporation for its and tax years 
subsequent to issuing these notices  the irs conceded a portion of its original assessment 
the total incremental tax liability now asserted by the irs for the applicable periods is billion plus interest 
the primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of guidant 
in addition  the irs has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our transaction agreement with abbott laboratories pertaining to the sale of guidant vascular intervention business to abbott in april we do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the

in addition  we believe that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing treasury regulations 
we believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed  or will timely file  petitions with the us tax court contesting the notices of deficiency for the tax years in challenge 
no payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved  which  based on experiences of other companies  could take several years 
we believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in january  president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of our current financial position and results of operations are not impacted by this act 
however  for  our results of operations are expected to be favorably impacted as certain provisions  including the us r d tax credit  are retroactively reenacted for the year ending december  refer to note j income taxes for our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand  comprised of million invested in money market and government funds and million in interest bearing and non interest bearing bank accounts 
we invest excess cash on hand in short term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection 
we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer 
we also have full access to our billion revolving credit facility and million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our us trade receivables  both described below

this increase was driven primarily by accounts receivable and inventory reductions  which generated approximately million  the impact of litigation related payments of approximately million to the us department of justice in  and lower tax related net cash outflows of approximately million during partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower operating profit in and a million increase in restructuring related payments as compared to our cash provided by operating activities in also included proceeds of approximately million related to the termination of our outstanding interest rate derivative contracts and the receipt of a million manufacturing cost true up payment from abbott in accordance with our supply agreement 
during we generated million more of operating cash flows than in this increase was driven primarily by lower litigation related payments of approximately billion 
our litigation related payments primarily consisted of a payment of approximately million to the us department of justice in the first quarter of  during  we made payments of billion to johnson johnson related to a patent litigation settlement and received million in connection with a litigation settlement with medinol 
our cash provided by operating activities in also included proceeds of approximately million related to the termination of our outstanding interest rate derivative contracts and the receipt of a million manufacturing cost true up payment from abbott in accordance with our supply agreement 
in we incurred net tax payments in the amount of million as compared to net tax related receipts of million in in addition  our cash flows include the receipt of a million milestone payment from abbott 

table of contents investing activities during  cash used for investing activities was million 
our investing activities included capital expenditures of million and payments for the acquisitions of cameron health inc  bridgepoint medical inc  rhythmia medical inc  and vessix vascular inc  totaling million 
we expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately million during during  cash provided by investing activities was comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of our neurovascular business to stryker 
we received billion of net cash proceeds during related to the sale of this business 
this cash inflow was partially offset by payments of million for acquisitions consummated during  and capital expenditures of million 
during  our investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of million  as well as payments of approximately million to acquire asthmatx  inc and certain other strategic assets 
financing activities our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt  proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs  discussed in note l stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
additionally  our financing activities included million of contingent payments primarily associated with the achievement of receiving fda approval of the s icd system in september debt we had total debt of billion as of december  and billion as of december  the debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of december  is as follows in millions thereafter total senior notes note the table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes  or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes 
in july  fitch ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to bbb  an investment grade rating  and in february  moody s investors service upgraded our corporate credit rating to baa  an investment grade rating 
in addition  standard poor ratings services has maintained an investment grade corporate credit rating for us since we believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio  our leading share position in several of our served markets  our strong cash flow  our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy 
term loan and revolving credit facility during  we prepaid the remaining billion of our term loan maturities without premium or penalty 
in the second quarter of  we established a billion revolving credit facility  maturing in april  with a global syndicate of commercial bank and terminated our previous revolving credit facility 
eurodollar and multicurrency loans under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus an interest margin of between percent and percent  based on our corporate credit ratings and consolidated leverage ratio percent  as of december  
in addition  we are required to pay a facility fee based on our credit ratings  consolidated leverage ratio  and the total amount of revolving credit commitments  regardless of usage  under the agreement percent  as of december  
there were no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of december  or december  
table of contents our revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants  as follows covenant requirement actual as of december  maximum leverage ratio times times minimum interest coverage ratio times times ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined by the credit agreement  for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters 
ratio of consolidated ebitda  as defined by the credit agreement  to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters 
the credit agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated ebitda  as defined by the agreement  through the credit agreement maturity  of up to million in restructuring charges and restructuring related expenses related to our current or future restructuring plans 
as of december   we had million of the combined restructuring charge exclusion remaining 
any non cash charges  as defined by the agreement  are excluded from the calculation of consolidated ebitda 
in addition  any cash litigation payments  as defined by the agreement  are excluded from the calculation of consolidated ebitda and any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments is excluded from consolidated total debt  as defined in the agreement  provided that the sum of any excluded cash litigation payments and any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments shall not exceed billion in the aggregate 
as of december   we had billion of the combined legal and debt exclusion remaining 
as of and through december   we were in compliance with the required covenants 
any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants  both of which could result in additional borrowing costs 
further  there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers 
senior notes we had senior notes outstanding in the amount of billion as of december  and december  in january  we paid million of our senior notes at maturity 
other arrangements we also maintain a million credit and security facility secured by our us trade receivables 
in june  we extended the maturity of this facility to june  subject to further extension 
there were no amounts borrowed under this facility as of december  or december  we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain european countries that we account for as sales under asc topic  transfers and servicing 
these agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties  without recourse  of up to approximately million as of december  we have no retained interests in the transferred receivables  other than collection and administrative responsibilities and  once sold  the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy 
we de recognized million of receivables as of december  at an average interest rate of percent  and million as of december  at an average interest rate of percent 
the european sovereign debt crisis may impact our future ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain southern european countries 
third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt 
this could result in terminations of  or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs 
such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding 
within italy  spain  and portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has increased above historical levels 
we believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to our italy  spain and portugal accounts receivable  however  we will continue to monitor the european economic environment for any collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables 
in addition  we are currently pursuing alternative factoring providers and financing arrangements to mitigate our credit exposure to receivables in this region 
during the first quarter of  the greek government converted a significant portion of our outstanding receivables into bonds  which we monetized during the first quarter and reduced our credit exposure in this country 
in addition  we have uncommitted credit facilities with a japanese bank that provide for borrowings  promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to billion japanese yen translated to approximately million as of december  
we de recognized million of notes receivable as of december  at an average interest rate of percent and million of notes receivable as of december  at an average interest rate of percent

contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments  and is based on conditions in existence as of december  in millions thereafter total long term debt obligations interest payments operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty obligations unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with us gaap  these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts in the table above with respect to operating lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property  plant and equipment used in the normal course of business 
purchase obligations relate primarily to non cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business 
royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements

with certain of our acquisitions  we acquired in process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory 
table of contents approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region 
we estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in process research and development projects acquired in is between million and million and we expect material net cash inflows from the projects in development to commence in through  following the respective launches of these technologies in the us  emea and japan regions 
certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration 
the table above does not reflect any such obligations  as the timing and amounts are uncertain 
see note b acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of december  legal matters the medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven 
as a result  intellectual property rights  particularly patents and trade secrets  play a significant role in product development and differentiation 
over the years  there has been litigation initiated against us by others  including our competitors  claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them 
intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable 
in addition  competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines  technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties 
in some cases  several competitors are parties in the same proceeding  or in a series of related proceedings  or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices 
these forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases  but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases 
although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought  remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal 
accordingly  the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time  predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies 
during recent years  we successfully negotiated closure of several long standing legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters  however  there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market 
adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins  financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
in the normal course of business  product liability  securities and commercial claims are asserted against us 
similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time 
we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims  and we are substantially self insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims 
the absence of significant third party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions 
product liability claims  securities and commercial litigation  and other legal proceedings in the future  regardless of their outcome  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
in addition  like other companies in the medical device industry  we are subject to extensive regulation by national  state and local government agencies in the united states and other countries in which we operate 
from time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory  marketing and other business practices 
these qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings  substantial fines  penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or liquidity 
our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was million as of december  and million as of december   and includes estimated costs of settlement  damages and defense 
we continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts  if any  that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and  therefore  additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future  which could materially adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and or our ability to comply with our debt covenants 
see further discussion of our material legal proceedings in note k commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies 
we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
we describe these accounting policies in note a significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 

table of contents to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider estimates to be critical if i we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if ii materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas requiring management s judgment that we consider critical revenue recognition we allow our customers to return defective  damaged and  in certain cases  expired products for credit 
we base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product 
in addition  we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings 
for these transactions  we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next generation products are shipped to the customer 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates 
many of our crm product offerings combine the sale of a device with our latitude patient management system  which represents a future service obligation 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation  we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations  therefore  we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available  otherwise  we use our best estimate of selling price 
we allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral 
inventory provisions we base our provisions for excess  expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess  expired and obsolete inventory in the future 
further  the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess  expired and obsolete inventory 
valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination  including purchased research and development  on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management  which consider management s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use 
further  for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration  we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future 
we re measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates  as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory  revenue or commercialization based milestones 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated revenue projections  growth rates  cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions  or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical  regulatory or revenue based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations  amortization expense  and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if an impairment indicator exists  we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable  as discussed in note a significant accounting policies  we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified 
in addition  we test our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets 
we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired  we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  we write the carrying value down to the fair value 

table of contents we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group 
the use of alternative assumptions  including estimated cash flows  discount rates  and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment 
goodwill valuation we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill 
we test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the assessment  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
we determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments  and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics 
for our annual impairment assessments  we identified six reporting units within the us  including our crm  neuromodulation  endoscopy  urology women health  electrophysiology  and cardiovascular consisting of interventional cardiology and peripheral interventions franchises  which in aggregate make up the us reportable segment 
in addition  we identified four international reporting units  including emea  japan  asia pacific and the americas 
when allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units  we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition 
in addition  for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests  assets and liabilities  including corporate assets  which relate to a reporting unit s operations  and would be considered in determining its fair value  are allocated to the individual reporting units 
we allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit  but from which the reporting unit benefits  based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit 
during   and  we used only the income approach  specifically the dcf method  to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
we have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach 
therefore  we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
in applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill  we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates 
the amount and timing of future cash flows within our dcf analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets  long range strategic plans and other estimates 
the terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our dcf analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable  perpetual growth of our reporting units 
we use estimates of market participant risk adjusted wacc as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
if we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated  we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate 
we would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods  once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test 
although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests  these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated revenue projections  growth rates  cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates 
we continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods 
these reporting units include our us crm reporting unit  which holds million 
table of contents of remaining allocated goodwill  our us cardiovascular reporting unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  and our us neuromodulation reporting unit  which holds billion of allocated goodwill  each as of december  as of december   the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk with the exception of the us crm reporting unit  whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value was approximately seven to percent 
during the fourth quarter of  the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our us cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance  declines in our market share due to competitive launches  and continued average selling price declines in the us drug eluting stent des market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes 
on a quarterly basis  we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets 
the key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability 
terminal value growth rate assumptions  as well as the wacc rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows 
these assumptions are subject to uncertainty  including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels 
relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges 
for example  keeping all other variables constant  a basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation reporting unit 
a basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us cardiovascular reporting unit 
an increase in the wacc applied of basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the us neuromodulation and us cardiovascular reporting units 
given that the carrying value of the us crm reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value  any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period 
the estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management best estimates  which we believe to be reasonable  but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances 
future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units and or amortizable intangible assets include  but are not limited to decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater than expected declines in procedural volumes  pricing pressures  product actions  and or competitive technology developments  declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition  an inability to develop or launch new and next generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies  and market and or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls  decreases in our profitability due to an inability to successfully implement and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations  increases in our market participant tax rate  and or changes in tax laws  negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products  the level of success of on going and future research and development efforts  including those related to recent acquisitions  and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products  the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies  achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations  establishing government and third party payer reimbursement  and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully  changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses  increases in our market participant risk adjusted wacc  and declines in revenue as a result of loss of key members of our sales force and other key personnel 
negative changes in one or more of these factors  among others  could result in additional impairment charges 

table of contents income taxes we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of these matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
we consider relevant evidence  both positive and negative  to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks  as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years

table of contents additional information use of non gaap financial measures used by boston scientific to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we disclose certain non gaap financial measures  including adjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per share that exclude certain amounts and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these non gaap financial measures are not in accordance with us gaap 
the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income loss is gaap net income loss and the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is gaap net income per share 
to calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we convert actual net sales from local currency to us dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period 
the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this non gaap financial measure is growth rate percentages using net sales on a gaap basis 
reconciliations of each of these non gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules 
management uses these supplemental non gaap financial measures to evaluate performance period over period  to analyze the underlying trends in our business  to assess its performance relative to its competitors  and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources 
in addition  management uses these non gaap financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments 
the adjustments excluded from our non gaap financial measures are consistent with those excluded from its operating segments measures of profit or loss 
these adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to the our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance 
we believe that presenting adjusted net income  adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  in addition to the corresponding gaap financial measures  provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for our financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management 
we further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance 
the following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non gaap financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items adjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per share goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges these amounts represent non cash write downs of our goodwill balances attributable to its a us cardiac rhythm management reporting unit in the third quarter of  b europe middle east africa emea reporting unit recorded in the second quarter of  and c us cardiac rhythm management reporting unit recorded in the first quarter of and non cash write downs of certain other intangible asset balances 
management removes the impact of non cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations 
management believes this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth 
therefore  these charges are excluded from management assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to the our past operating performance  particularly in terms of liquidity 
acquisition and divestiture related net credits these adjustments consist of a acquisition related gains on previously held investments  b contingent consideration fair value adjustments  c inventory step up adjustments  d due diligence and other fees  exit costs and other costs and credits related to current and prior period acquisitions  e gains resulting from business divestitures and f fees and separation costs associated with business divestitures 
the acquisition related gains on previously held investments are non recurring benefits associated with acquisitions completed in the second quarter and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of the contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value 
these adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments 
the inventory step up adjustment is a charge related to acquired inventory directly attributable to prior acquisitions and is not indicative of our on going operations  or on going cost of products sold 
due diligence  exit costs and other costs and credits include legal  tax  severance and other expenses and credits associated with prior acquisitions that are not representative of on going operations 
the divestiture related net credits are related to the 
table of contents sale of our neurovascular business in january the resulting gains are not indicative of future operating performance and are not used by management to assess operating performance 
fees and separation costs represent those associated with our divestiture of its neurovascular business and are not representative of on going operations 
accordingly  management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
restructuring and restructuring related charges these adjustments represent primarily severance  costs to transfer production lines from one facility to another  and other direct costs associated with the company restructuring plan  restructuring plan and plant network optimization program 
these expenses are excluded by management in assessing the our operating performance  as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
accordingly  management excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
litigation related charges these adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation related charges and credits 
these amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance  as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
accordingly  management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
discrete tax items these items represent adjustments of certain tax positions  which were initially established in prior periods as a result of intangible asset impairment charges  acquisition  divestiture  restructuring or litigation related charges credits 
these adjustments do not reflect expected on going operating results 
accordingly  management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
amortization expense amortization expense is a non cash charge and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in its credit facility agreement 
management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations 
management believes this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth 
therefore  amortization expense is excluded from management assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation 
accordingly  management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non gaap financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance  particularly in terms of liquidity 
regional and divisional revenue growth rates excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in foreign currency exchange rates the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict 
accordingly  management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance 
adjusted net income loss  adjusted net income loss per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
further  other companies may calculate these non gaap financial measures differently than us  which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes
