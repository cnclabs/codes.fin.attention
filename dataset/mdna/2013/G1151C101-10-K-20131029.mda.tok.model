we use the term in local currency so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of business performance

this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
overview revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges 
the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 
our results of operations are affected by economic conditions  including macroeconomic conditions  credit market conditions and levels of business confidence 
there continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in markets around the world  as well as lower levels of spending on some of the types of services we provide in many of the industries we serve  all of which are impacting  and we expect will continue to impact  our business 
these conditions have impacted the types of services our clients are demanding 
clients are requesting a higher volume of outsourcing services and are placing a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives and in some cases  slowing the pace and level of spending on existing contracts 
these changing demand patterns are currently having an adverse impact on the timing of revenue and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions

we continued to enter into a higher proportion of contracts with longer duration that are converting to revenue at a slower pace  and clients slowed the pace and level of their spending 
we expect these trends to continue in the near term 
clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency  as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses 
we continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies  including analytics  cloud computing and mobility

health public service  financial services and products experienced strong year over year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency during the fourth quarter of fiscal year over year outsourcing revenue growth in local currency was slight in resources and declined in communications  media technology 
outsourcing revenue growth continued to be moderate  compared to the strong year over year growth that we experienced in the first half of fiscal  as some clients slowed the pace and level of their spending and we expect these trends to continue in the near term 
clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs 
compared to fiscal  we provided a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower cost resources in our global delivery network 
as we are a global company  our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
if the us dollar weakens against other currencies  resulting in favorable currency translation  our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be higher 
if the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  resulting in unfavorable currency translation  our revenues and revenue growth in us dollars may be lower 
when compared to fiscal  the us dollar strengthened against many currencies during fiscal this resulted in unfavorable currency translation and us dollar revenue growth that was approximately and lower than our revenue growth in local currency for the fourth quarter and fiscal  respectively 
assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges  we estimate the foreign exchange impact to our fiscal revenue growth will be lower growth in us dollars than our growth in local currency 
the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs 
cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client service personnel  which consists mainly of compensation  subcontractor and other personnel costs  and non payroll outsourcing costs 
cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services  the utilization of our client service personnel and the level of non payroll costs associated with outsourcing contracts 
utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals time spent on billable work 
utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal was approximately  flat with the third quarter of fiscal  and within our target range 
this level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our global delivery network and in most countries 
we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand 
we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services  given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
based on current and projected future demand  we have increased our headcount  the majority of which serve our clients  to approximately  as of august   compared with approximately  as of may  and approximately  as of august  the year over year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services  including those delivered through our global delivery network in lower cost locations 
annualized attrition  excluding involuntary terminations  for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  flat with both the third quarter of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal we evaluate voluntary attrition  adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with increases or decreases in client demand 
in addition  we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees  and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future 
for the majority of our personnel  compensation increases for fiscal became effective september  as in prior fiscal years  we strive to adjust pricing and or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin 
our ability to grow our revenues and increase our margins could be adversely affected if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding  such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing services  deploy our employees globally on a timely basis  manage attrition  recover increases in compensation  and or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees 
gross margin net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal was  compared with for the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal the increase in gross margin for fiscal was principally due to higher outsourcing contract profitability  partially offset by higher costs associated with investments in offerings 
sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with for the fourth quarter of fiscal sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities  investment in offerings  marketing and advertising related activities  and acquisition related costs 
general and administrative costs primarily include costs for non client facing personnel  information systems and office space 
we continuously monitor these costs and implement cost management actions  as appropriate 
for fiscal compared to fiscal  sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues increased approximately basis points as a result of higher selling and other business development costs associated with generating new contract bookings and expanding our pipeline of business opportunities  as well as acquisition related costs 
our margins could 
table of contents be adversely affected if our cost management actions are not sufficient to maintain sales and marketing and general and administrative costs at or below current levels as a percentage of net revenues
