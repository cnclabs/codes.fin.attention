item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview of oil and gas well drilling and servicing processes oil and gas wells are usually drilled by drilling contractors using a drilling rig 
a bit is attached to the end of a drill stem  which is assembled by the drilling rig and its crew from foot joints of drill pipe and specialized drilling components known as downhole tools 
using the conventional rotary drilling method  the drill stem is turned from the rotary table of the drilling rig by torque applied to the kelly  which is screwed into the top of the drill stem 
increasingly  drilling is performed using a drilling motor  which is attached to the bottom of the drill stem and provides rotational force directly to the bit  and a top drive  a device suspended from the derrick that turns the entire drill stem  rather than such force being supplied by the rotary table 
the use of drilling motors and top drives permits the drilling contractor to drill directionally  including horizontally 
the company sells and rents drilling motors  drill bits  downhole tools and drill pipe through its petroleum services supplies segment and sells and rents top drives through its rig technology segment 
during drilling  heavy drilling fluids or drilling muds are pumped down the drill stem and forced out through jets in the bit 
the drilling mud returns to the surface through the space between the borehole wall and the drill stem  carrying with it the drill cuttings drilled out by the bit 
the drill cuttings are removed from the mud by a solids control system which can include shakers  centrifuges and other specialized equipment and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner 
the solids control system permits the mud  which is often comprised of expensive chemicals  to be continuously reused and re circulated back into the hole 
through its rig technology segment  the company sells the large mud pumps that are used to pump drilling mud through the drill stem 
through its petroleum services supplies segment  the company sells transfer pumps and mud pump consumables  sells and rents solids control equipment  and provides solids control  waste management and drilling fluids services 
many operators internally coat the drill stem to improve its hydraulic efficiency and protect it from corrosive fluids sometimes encountered during drilling  and inspect and assess the integrity of the drill pipe from time to time 
the company provides drill pipe inspection and coating services  and applies hardbanding material to drill pipe to improve its wear characteristics 
these services are provided through the petroleum services supplies segment 
additionally  the petroleum services supplies segment manufactures and sells drill pipe 

table of contents as the hole depth increases  the kelly must be removed frequently so that additional foot joints of drill pipe can be added to the drill stem 
when the bit becomes dull or the equipment at the bottom of the drill stem including the drilling motors otherwise requires servicing  the entire drill stem is pulled out of the hole and disassembled by disconnecting the joints of drill pipe 
these are set aside or racked  the old bit is replaced or service is performed  and the drill stem is reassembled and lowered back into the hole a process called tripping 
during drilling and tripping operations  joints of drill pipe must be screwed together and tightened made up  and loosened and unscrewed spun out 
the rig technology segment provides drilling equipment to manipulate and maneuver the drill pipe in this manner 
when the hole has reached certain depths  all of the drill pipe is pulled out of the hole and larger diameter pipe known as casing is lowered into the hole and permanently cemented in place in order to protect against collapse and contamination of the hole 
the casing is typically inspected before it is lowered into the hole  a service the petroleum services supplies segment provides 
the rig technology segment manufactures pressure pumping equipment that is used to cement the casing in place 
the raising and lowering of the drill stem while drilling or tripping  and the lowering of casing into the wellbore  is accomplished with the rig s hoisting system 
a conventional hoisting system is a block and tackle mechanism that works within the drilling rig s derrick 
the lifting of this mechanism is performed via a series of pulleys that are attached to the drawworks at the base of the derrick 
the rig technology segment sells and installs drawworks and pipe hoisting systems 
during the course of normal drilling operations  the drill stem passes through different geological formations  which exhibit varying pressure characteristics 
if this pressure is not contained  oil  gas and or water would flow out of these formations to the surface 
the two means of containing these reservoir pressures are i primarily the circulation of drilling muds while drilling and ii secondarily the use of blowout preventers bops should the mud prove inadequate in an emergency situation 
the rig technology segment sells and services blowout preventers 
drilling muds are carefully designed to exhibit certain qualities that optimize the drilling process 
in addition to containing formation pressure  they must i provide power to the drilling motor  ii carry drilled solids to the surface  iii protect the drilled formations from being damaged  and iv cool the drill bit 
achieving these objectives often requires a formulation specific to a given well and can involve the use of expensive chemicals as well as natural materials  such as certain types of clay 
the fluid itself is often oil or more expensive synthetic mud 
given this expense  it is highly desirable to reuse as much of the drilling mud as possible 
solids control equipment such as shale shakers  centrifuges  cuttings dryers  and mud cleaners help accomplish this objective 
the petroleum services supplies segment rents  sells  operates and services this equipment 
drilling muds are formulated based on expected drilling conditions 
however  as the hole is drilled  the drill stem may encounter a high pressure zone where the mud density is inadequate to maintain sufficient pressure 
should efforts to weight up the mud in order to contain such a pressure kick fail  a blowout could result  whereby reservoir fluids would flow uncontrolled into the well 
to prevent blowouts to the surface of the well  a series of high pressure valves known as blowout preventers are positioned at the top of the well and  when activated  form tight seals that prevent the escape of fluids 
when closed  conventional bops prevent normal rig operations 
therefore  the bops are activated only if drilling mud and normal well control procedures cannot safely contain the pressure 
the operations of the rig and the condition of the drilling mud are closely monitored by various sensors  which measure operating parameters such as the weight on the rig s hook  the incidence of pressure kicks  the operation of the drilling mud pumps  etc 
through its rig technology segment  the company sells and rents drilling rig instrumentation packages that perform these monitoring functions 
during the drilling and completion of a well  there exists an ongoing need for various consumables and spare parts 
while most of these items are small  in the aggregate they represent an important element of the process 
since it is impractical for each drilling location to have a full supply of these items  drilling contractors and well service companies tend to rely on third parties to stock and deliver these items 
the company provides this capability through its distribution transmission segment  which stocks and sells spares and consumables made by third parties  as well as spares and consumables made by the company 
after the well has reached its total depth and the final section of casing has been set  the drilling rig is moved off of the well and the well is prepared to begin producing oil or gas in a process known as well completion 
well completion usually involves installing production tubing concentrically in the casing 
due to the corrosive nature of many produced fluids  production tubing is often inspected and coated  services offered by the petroleum services supplies segment 
sometimes operators choose to use corrosion resistant composite materials  which the company also offers through its petroleum services supplies segment  or corrosion resistant alloys  or operators sometimes pump fluids into wells to inhibit corrosion 
from time to time  a producing well may undergo workover procedures to extend its life and increase its production rate 
workover rigs are used to disassemble the wellhead  tubing and other completion components of an existing well in order to stimulate or remediate the well 
workover rigs are similar to drilling rigs in their capabilities to handle tubing  but are usually smaller and somewhat less sophisticated 
the company offers a comprehensive range of workover rigs through its rig technology segment 
tubing and sucker rods removed from a well during a well remediation operation are often inspected to determine their suitability to be reused in the well  which is a service the petroleum services supplies segment provides 

table of contents frequently  coiled tubing units or wireline units are used to accomplish certain well remediation operations or well completions 
coiled tubing is a recent advancement in petroleum technology consisting of a continuous length of reeled steel tubing which can be injected concentrically into the production tubing all the way to the bottom of most wells 
it permits many operations to be performed without disassembling the production tubing  and without curtailing the production of the well 
wireline winch units are devices that utilize single strand or multi strand wires to perform well remediation operations  such as lowering tools and transmitting data to the surface 
through the rig technology segment  the company sells and rents various types of coiled tubing equipment and wireline equipment and tools 
the company also manufactures and sells coiled tubing pipe through its petroleum services supplies segment 
rig technology the company has a long tradition of pioneering innovations in drilling and well servicing equipment which improve the efficiency  safety  and cost of drilling and well servicing operations 
the rig technology segment designs  manufactures and sells a wide variety of top drives  automated pipe handling systems  motion compensation systems  rig controls  bops  handling tools  drawworks  risers  rotary tables  mud pumps  cranes  drilling motors  turret mooring systems and other products for fpsos and other offshore vessels and terminals  and other drilling equipment for both the onshore and offshore markets 
rig technology also manufactures entire rig packages  both drilling and workover  in addition to well servicing equipment such as coiled tubing units  pressure pumping equipment  and wireline winches 
the rig technology segment sells directly to drilling contractors  shipyards and other rig fabricators  well servicing companies  national oil companies  major and independent oil and gas companies  supply stores  and pipe running service providers 
rig technology rents and sells proprietary drilling rig instrumentation packages and control systems which monitor various processes throughout the drilling operation  under the name md totco instrumentation 
demand for its products  several of which are described below  is strongly dependent upon capital spending plans by oil and gas companies and drilling contractors  and the level of oil and gas well drilling activity 
land rig packages 
the company designs  manufactures  assembles  upgrades  and supplies equipment sets to a variety of land drilling rigs  including those specifically designed to operate in harsh environments such as the arctic circle and the desert 
our key land rig product names include the drake rig  ideal rig and rapid rig 
the company s recent rig packages are designed to be safer and fast moving  to utilize ac technology  and to reduce manpower required to operate a rig 
top drives 
the top drive drilling system tds  originally introduced by the company in  significantly alters the traditional drilling process 
the tds rotates the drill stem from its top  rather than by the rotary table  with a large electric motor affixed to rails installed in the derrick that traverses the length of the derrick to the rig floor 
therefore  the tds eliminates the use of the conventional rotary table for drilling 
components of the tds also are used to connect additional joints of drill pipe to the drill stem during drilling operations  enabling drilling with three joints of drill pipe compared to traditionally drilling with one joint of drill pipe 
additionally  the tds facilitates horizontal and extended reach drilling 
electric rig motors 
the company has helped lead the application of ac motor technology in the oilfield industry 
the company buys motors from third parties and builds them in its own facilities and is further developing motor technology  including the introduction of permanent magnet motor technology to the industry 
these permanent magnet motors are being used in top drives  cranes  mud pumps  winches  and drawworks 
rotary equipment 
the alternative to using a tds to rotate the drill stem is to use a rotary table  which rotates the pipe at the floor of the rig 
rig technology produces rotary tables as well as kelly bushings and master bushings for most sizes of kellys and makes of rotary tables 
in  the company introduced the rotary support table for use on rigs with a tds 
the rotary support table is used in concert with the tds to completely eliminate the need for the larger conventional rotary table 
pipe handling systems 
pipe racking systems are used to handle drill pipe  casing and tubing on a drilling rig 
vertical pipe racking systems move drill pipe and casing between the well and a storage racking area on the rig floor 
horizontal racking systems are used to handle tubulars while stored horizontally for example  on the pipe deck of an offshore rig and transport tubulars up to the rig floor and into a vertical position for use in the drilling process 
vertical pipe racking systems are used predominantly on offshore rigs and are found on almost all floating rigs 
mechanical vertical pipe racking systems greatly reduce the manual effort involved in pipe handling 
pipe racking systems  introduced by the company in  provide a fully automated mechanism for handling and racking drill pipe during drilling and tripping operations  spinning and torquing drill pipe  and automatic hoisting and racking of disconnected joints of drill pipe 
these functions can be integrated via computer controlled sequencing  and operated by a driller in an environmentally secure cabin 
an important element of this system is the iron roughneck  which was originally introduced by the company in and is an automated device that makes pipe connections on the rig floor and requires less direct involvement of rig floor personnel in potentially dangerous operations 
the automated roughneck is an automated microprocessor controlled version of the iron roughneck 

table of contents horizontal pipe transfer systems were introduced by the company in they include the pipe deck machine pdm  which is used to manipulate and move tubulars while stored in a horizontal position  the pipe transfer conveyor ptc  which transports sections of pipe to the rig floor  and a pickup laydown system pls  which raises the pipe to a vertical position for transfer to a vertical racking system 
these components may be employed separately  or incorporated together to form a complete horizontal racking system  known as the pipe transfer system pts 
pipe handling tools 
the company s pipe handling tools are designed to enhance the safety  efficiency and reliability of pipe handling operations 
many of these tools have provided innovative methods of performing the designated task through mechanization of functions previously performed manually 
the rig technology segment manufactures various tools used to grip  hold  raise  and lower pipe  and in the making up and breaking out of drill pipe  workstrings  casing and production tubulars including spinning wrenches  manual tongs  torque wrenches and kelly spinners 
mud pumps 
mud pumps are high pressure pumps located on the rig that force drilling mud down the drill pipe  through the drill bit  and up the space between the drill pipe and the drilled formation the annulus back to the surface 
these pumps  which generate pressures of up to  psi  must therefore be capable of displacing drilling fluids several thousand feet down and back up the well bore 
the conventional mud pump design  known as the triplex pump  uses three reciprocating pistons oriented horizontally 
the company has introduced the hex pump  which uses six pumping cylinders  versus the three used in the triplex pump 
along with other design features  the greater number of cylinders reduces pulsations or surges and increases the output available from a given footprint 
reduced pulsation is desirable where downhole measurement equipment is being used during the drilling process  as is often the case in directional drilling 
hoisting systems 
hoisting systems are used to raise or lower the drill stem while drilling or tripping  and to lower casing into the wellbore 
the drawworks is the heart of the hoisting system 
it is a large winch that spools off or takes in the drilling line  which is in turn connected to the drill stem at the top of the derrick 
the drawworks also plays an important role in keeping the weight on the drill bit at a desired level 
this task is particularly challenging on offshore drilling rigs  which are subject to wave motion 
to address this  the company has introduced the active heave drilling ahd drawworks 
the ahd drawworks uses computer controlled motors to compensate for the motion experienced in offshore drilling operations 
cranes 
the company provides a comprehensive range of crane solutions  with purpose built products for all segments of the oil and gas industry as well as many other markets 
the company encompasses a broad collection of brand names with international recognition  and includes a large staff of engineers specializing in the design of cranes and related equipment 
the product range extends from small cargo handling cranes to the world s largest marine cranes 
in all  the company provides over twenty crane product lines that include standard model configurations as well as custom engineered and specialty cranes 
motion compensation systems 
traditionally  motion compensation equipment is located on top of the drilling rig and serves to stabilize the bit on the bottom of the hole  increasing drilling effectiveness of floating offshore rigs by compensating for wave and wind action 
the ahd drawworks  discussed above  was introduced to eliminate weight and improve safety  removing the compensator from the top of the rig and integrating it into the drawworks system 
in addition to the ahd drawworks  the company has introduced an active heave compensation ahc system that goes beyond the capabilities of the ahd drawworks to handle the most severe weather 
additionally  the company s tensioning systems provide continuous axial tension to the marine riser pipe larger diameter pipe which connects floating drilling rigs to the well on the ocean floor and guide lines on floating drilling rigs  tension leg platforms and jack up drilling rigs 
blowout preventers 
bops are devices used to seal the space between the drill pipe and the borehole to prevent blowouts uncontrolled flows of formation fluids and gases to the surface 
the rig technology segment manufactures a wide array of bops used in various situations 
ram and annular bops are back up devices that are activated only if other techniques for controlling pressure in the wellbore are inadequate 
when closed  these devices prevent normal rig operations 
ram bops seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing rams thick heavy blocks of steel against each other across the wellbore 
specially designed packers seal around specific sizes of pipe in the wellbore  shear pipe in the wellbore or close off an open hole 
annular bops seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing a rubber packing unit around the drill pipe or kelly or by sealing against itself if nothing is in the hole 
the company s pressure control while drilling pcwd bop  introduced in  allows operators to drill at pressures up to  psi without interrupting normal operations  and can act as a normal spherical bop at pressures up to  psi 
in  the company introduced the nxt ram type bop which eliminates door bolts  providing significant weight  rig time  and space savings 
its unique features make subsea operation more efficient through faster ram configuration changes without tripping the bop stack 
in  the company introduced the lxt  which features many of the design elements of the nxt  but is targeted at the land market 
in  the company began commercializing technology related to a continuous circulation device 
this device enables drilling contractors to make and break drill pipe connections without stopping the circulation of drilling fluids  which helps increase drilling efficiency 

table of contents the shearmax tm line of low force bop shear rams released in add substantial tubular shearing capability to the company s line of pressure control equipment  including the capability to shear large drill pipe tool joints  previously unheard of in the industry 
this innovative shear blade design utilizes patented puncture technology to reduce the shearing pressures or more and in some cases as much as five times lower 
the shearmax tm blind shear provides a shear and seal design for drill pipe  while the casing and tjc shears address casing up to od and most tool joints up to wall thickness  respectively 
derricks and substructures 
drilling activities are carried out from a drilling rig 
a drilling rig consists of one or two derricks  the substructure that supports the derrick s  and the rig package  which consists of the various pieces of equipment discussed above 
rig technology designs  fabricates and services derricks used in both onshore and offshore applications  and substructures used in onshore applications 
the rig technology segment also works with shipyards in the fabrication of substructures for offshore drilling rigs 
instrumentation 
the company s instrumentation business provides drilling rig operators real time measurement and monitoring of critical parameters required to improve rig safety and efficiency 
in  the company introduced its rigsense wellsite information system  which combines leading hardware and software technologies into an integrated drilling rig package 
access of drilling data is provided to offsite locations  enabling company personnel to monitor drilling operations from an office environment  through a secure link 
systems are both sold and rented  and are comprised of hazardous area sensors placed throughout the rig to measure critical drilling parameters  all networked back to a central command station for review  recording and interpretation 
the company offers unique business integration services to directly integrate information into business applications that improves accuracy and assists drilling contractors in managing their drilling business 
reports on drilling activities and processes are now provided from the rig site as a part of the drillsuite business solution to allow contractors to streamline administration by eliminating manual entry of data  promotes accurate payroll processing and invoicing  and includes asset tracking and preventive maintenance management through its rigms solution 
the real time information provided also allows the company to advance the drilling process using advanced drilling algorithms and electronic controls such as our wildcat auto drilling system for better execution of the well plan  enhanced rates of penetration  reduced program costs  and improved wellbore quality 
complementing the company s surface solutions is a portfolio of down hole instrumentation dhi products for both straight hole and directional markets 
key advancements in this area include the introduction of the company s time saving etotco electronic drift recorder  which serves as an electronic equivalent to the traditional mechanical drift tool that the company has offered since coiled tubing equipment 
coiled tubing consists of flexible steel tubing manufactured in a continuous string and spooled on a reel 
it can extend several thousand feet in length and is run in and out of the wellbore at a high rate of speed by a hydraulically operated coiled tubing unit 
a coiled tubing unit is typically mounted on a truck  semi trailer or skid steel frames on which portable equipment is mounted to facilitate handling with cranes for offshore use and consists of a hydraulically operated tubing reel or drum  an injector head which pushes or pulls the tubing in or out of the wellbore  and various power and control systems 
coiled tubing is typically used with sophisticated pressure control equipment which permits the operator to perform workover operations on a live well 
the rig technology segment manufactures and sells both coiled tubing units and the ancillary pressure control equipment used in these operations 
through its acquisition of rolligon in late  the company enhanced its portfolio by adding additional pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment products 
currently  most coiled tubing units are used in well remediation and completion applications 
the company believes that advances in the manufacturing process of coiled tubing  tubing fatigue protection and the capability to manufacture larger diameter and increased wall thickness coiled tubing strings have resulted in increased uses and applications for coiled tubing products 
for example  some well operators are now using coiled tubing in drilling applications such as slim hole re entries of existing wells 
the company engineered and manufactured the first coiled tubing units built specifically for coiled tubing drilling in generally  the rig technology segment supplies customers with the equipment and components necessary to use coiled tubing  which the customers typically purchase separately 
the rig technology segment s coiled tubing product line consists of coiled tubing units  coiled tubing pressure control equipment  pressure pumping equipment  snubbing units which are units that force tubulars into a well when pressure is contained within the wellbore  nitrogen pumping equipment and cementing  stimulation  fracturing and blending equipment 
wireline equipment 
the company s wireline products include wireline drum units  which consist of a spool or drum of wireline cable  mounted in a mobile vehicle or skid  which works in conjunction with a source of power an engine mounted in the vehicle or within a separate power pack skid 
the wireline drum unit is used to spool wireline cable into or out of a well  in order to perform surveys inside the well  sample fluids from the bottom of the well  retrieve or replace components from inside the well  or to perform other well remediation or survey operations 
the wireline used may be slick line  which is conventional single strand steel cable used to convey tools in or out of the well  or electric line  which contains an imbedded single conductor or multi conductor electrical line which permits communication between the surface and electronic instruments attached to the end of the wireline at the bottom of the well 

table of contents wireline units are usually used in conjunction with a variety of other pressure control equipment which permit safe access into wells while they are flowing and under pressure at the surface

tubular coating 
the company develops  manufactures and applies its proprietary tubular coatings  known as tube kote coatings  to new and used tubulars 
tubular coatings help prevent corrosion of tubulars by providing a tough plastic shield to isolate steel from corrosive oilfield fluids such as co 
 h 
s and brine 
delaying or preventing corrosion extends the life of existing tubulars  reduces the frequency of well remediation and reduces expensive interruptions in production 
in addition  coatings are designed to increase the fluid flow rate through tubulars by decreasing or eliminating paraffin and scale build up  which can reduce or block oil flow in producing wells 
the smooth inner surfaces of coated tubulars often increase the fluid through put on certain high rate oil and gas wells by reducing friction and turbulence 
the company s reputation for supplying quality internal coatings is an important factor in its business  since the failure of coatings can lead to expensive production delays and premature tubular failure 
in  the company created a owned joint venture in china with the huabei petroleum administration bureau  which coats chinese produced drill pipe using the company s proprietary coatings 
in  the joint venture opened a second coating plant in jiangyin city  china 
in addition to the company s tk coatings  it also has complementary corrosion control products and services including tk liners  tubowrap  and kc ipc connections 
tk liners are fiberglass reinforced tubes which are inserted into steel line pipe 
this safeguards the pipe against corrosion and extends the life of the pipeline 
in conjunction with the thru kote connection system customers can weld a sleeve for a continuous fiberglass lined pipeline 
tubo wrap is a high performance external coating that protects the pipe during installation and from corrosion once the pipeline is in place 
kc ipc connections use a modified american petroleum institute api coupling to create a gas tight seal that prevents corrosion and turbulence in the critical connections of tubulars while protecting the internal plastic coating at the highly loaded contact points 
tubular inspection 
newly manufactured pipe sometimes contains serious defects that are not detected at the mill 
in addition  pipe can be damaged in transit and during handling prior to use at the well site 
as a result  exploration and production companies often have new tubulars inspected before they are placed in service to reduce the risk of tubular failures during drilling  completion  or production of oil and gas wells 
used tubulars are inspected by the company to detect service induced flaws after the tubulars are removed from operation 
used drill pipe and used tubing inspection programs allow operators to replace defective lengths  thereby prolonging the life of the remaining pipe and saving the customer the cost of unnecessary tubular replacements and expenses related to tubular failures 
tubular inspection services employ all major non destructive inspection techniques  including electromagnetic  ultrasonic  magnetic flux leakage and gamma ray 
these inspection services are provided both by mobile units which work at the wellhead as used tubing is removed from a well  and at fixed site tubular inspection locations 
the company provides an ultrasonic inspection service for detecting potential fatigue cracks in the end area of used drill pipe  the portion of the pipe that traditionally has been the most difficult to inspect 
tubular inspection facilities also offer a wide range of related services  such as api thread inspection  ring and plug gauging  and a complete line of reclamation services necessary to return tubulars to useful service  including tubular cleaning and straightening  hydrostatic testing and re threading 
in addition  the company applies hardbanding material to drill pipe  to enhance its wear characteristics and reduce downhole casing wear as a result of the drilling process 
in  the company introduced its proprietary line of hardbanding material  tcs 
the company also cleans  straightens  inspects and coats sucker rods at facilities throughout the western hemisphere 
additionally  new sucker rods are inspected before they are placed into service  to avoid premature failure  which can cause the oil well operator to have to pull and replace the sucker rod

as a result of its april acquisition of grant prideco  the company manufactures and sells a variety of drill stem products used for the drilling of oil and gas wells 
the principal products sold by drill pipe products are i drill pipe  ii drill collars and heavyweight drill pipe and iii drill stem accessories including tool joints 
drill pipe is the principal tool  other than the rig  required for the drilling of an oil or gas well 
its primary purpose is to connect the above surface drilling rig to the drill bit 
a drilling rig will typically have an inventory of  to  feet of drill pipe depending on the size and service requirements of the rig 
joints of drill pipe are connected to each other with a welded on tool joint to form what is commonly referred to as the drill string or drill stem 
when a drilling rig is operating  motors mounted on the rig rotate the drill pipe and drill bit 
in addition to connecting the drilling rig to the drill bit  drill pipe provides a mechanism to steer the drill bit and serves as a conduit for drilling fluids and cuttings 
drill pipe is a capital good that can be used for the drilling of multiple wells 
once a well is completed  the drill pipe may be used again and again to drill other wells until the drill pipe becomes damaged or wears out 
in recent years  the depth and complexity of the wells customers drill  as well as the specifications and requirements of the drill pipe they purchase  have substantially increased 
a majority of the drill pipe sold is required to meet specifications exceeding minimum api standards 
the company offers a broad line of premium drilling products designed for the offshore  international and domestic drilling markets 
the company s premium drilling products include its proprietary lines of xt and turbotorque tm connections and large diameter drill pipe that delivers hydraulic performance superior to standard sizes 
drill collars are used in the drilling process to place weight on the drill bit for better control and penetration 
drill collars are located directly above the drill bit and are manufactured from a solid steel bar to provide necessary weight 
heavyweight drill pipe is a thick walled seamless tubular product that is less rigid than a drill collar 
heavyweight drill pipe provides a gradual transition between the heavier drill collar and the lighter drill pipe 
the company also provides subs  pup joints short and odd sized tubular products and other drill stem accessories 
these products all perform special functions within the drill string as part of the drilling process

fiberglass composite tubulars 
when compared to conventional carbon steel and even corrosion resistant alloys  resin impregnated fiberglass and other modern plastic composites often exhibit superior resistance to corrosion 
some producers manage the corrosive fluids sometimes found in oil and gas fields by utilizing composite or fiberglass tubing  casing and line pipe in the operations of their fields 
in  the company acquired fiber glass systems  a leading provider of high pressure fiberglass tubulars used in oilfield applications  to further serve the tubular corrosion prevention needs of its customers 
fiber glass systems has manufactured fiberglass pipe since under the name star  and was the first manufacturer of high pressure fiberglass pipe to be licensed by the api in through further acquisitions and investments in technologies  the company has extended its fiberglass and composite tubing offering into industrial and marine applications  in addition to its oilfield market

fiberspar has its manufacturing plant in houston  tx  and maintains deployment centers stocking locations for its products in the us  canada and australia 
coiled tubing 
coiled tubing provides a number of significant functional advantages over the principal alternatives of conventional drill pipe and workover pipe 
coiled tubing allows faster tripping  since the coiled tubing can be reeled quickly on and off a drum and in and out of a wellbore 
in addition  the small size of the coiled tubing unit compared to an average workover rig or drilling rig reduces preparation time at the well site 
coiled tubing permits a variety of workover and other operations to be performed without having to pull the existing production tubing from the well and allows ease of operation in horizontal or highly deviated wells 
thus  operations using coiled tubing can be performed much more quickly and  in many instances  at a significantly lower cost 
finally  use of coiled tubing generally allows continuous production of the well  eliminating the need to temporarily stop the flow of hydrocarbons 
as a result  the economics of a workover are improved because the well can continue to produce hydrocarbons and thus produce revenues while the well treatments are occurring 
continuous production also reduces the risk of formation damage which can occur when the flow of fluids is stopped or isolated 
under normal operating conditions  the coiled tubing string must be replaced every three to four months 
the company designs  manufactures  and sells coiled tubing under the quality tubing brand name at its mill in houston  texas

motors are capable of achieving higher rotary velocities than can generally be achieved using conventional surface rotary equipment 
motors are often used in conjunction with high speed pdc bits to improve rates of penetration 
nov downhole also manufactures and sells drilling jars and fishing tools 
drilling jars are placed in the drill string  where they can be used to generate a sudden  jarring motion to free the drill string should it become stuck in the wellbore during the drilling process 
this jarring motion is generated using hydraulic and or mechanical force provided at the surface 
in the event that a portion of the drill string becomes stuck and cannot be jarred loose  fishing tools are run into the wellbore on the end of the drill string to retrieve the portion that is stuck 
through its coring services business line  nov downhole offers coring solutions that enable the extraction of actual rock samples from a drilled well bore and allow geologists to examine the formations at the surface 
one of the coring services utilized is the company s unique corion express system which allows the customer to drill and core a well without tripping pipe

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference herein 
realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the level of activity in the oil and gas industry  which is volatile 
the oil and gas industry historically has experienced significant volatility 
demand for our services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil rigs in operation  the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of these wells  the volume of production  the number of well completions  capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and the level of workover activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures to explore for and produce oil and natural gas and the willingness of oilfield service companies to invest in capital equipment will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control  including the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits  the level of production by non opec countries and worldwide demand for oil and gas  level of production from known reserves  cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  level of drilling activity and drilling rig dayrates  worldwide economic activity  national government political requirements  development of alternate energy sources  and environmental regulations 
if there is a significant reduction in demand for drilling services  in cash flows of drilling contractors  well servicing companies  or production companies or in drilling or well servicing rig utilization rates  then demand for the products and services of the company will decline 
volatile oil and gas prices affect demand for our products 
oil and gas prices have been volatile since in general  oil prices approximated per barrel from through  experienced a decline into the low teens in and  and have generally ranged between per barrel since in  oil prices were extremely volatile oil prices rose to per barrel in july only to fall into the per barrel range in december in  oil prices continued to be volatile  rising to the per barrel range during the year 
in oil prices continued rising to finish the year well above per barrel 
domestic spot gas prices generally ranged between per mmbtu of gas from through then experienced spikes into the range in and prices generally ranged between per mmbtu during during through  spot gas prices generally stabilized  dropping into the per mmbtu range  but declined below late in and throughout much of before increasing slightly above in late expectations for future oil and gas prices cause many shifts in the strategies and expenditure levels of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors  particularly with respect to decisions to purchase major capital equipment of the type we manufacture 
oil and gas prices  which are determined by the marketplace  may fall below a range that is acceptable to our customers  which could reduce demand for our products 

table of contents worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 
events in and constrained credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis 
the slowdown in worldwide economic activity caused by the global recession reduced demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
while markets have improved since  recent economic data suggests the potential for another global recession  which could negatively impact oil and natural gas prices and restrict availability to credit markets 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
furthermore  many of our customers access the credit markets to finance their oil and natural gas drilling activity 
if the availability of credit to our customers is reduced  they may reduce their drilling and production expenditures  thereby decreasing demand for our products and services 
any such reduction in spending by our customers could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
there are risks associated with certain contracts for our drilling equipment 
as of december   we had a backlog of approximately billion of drilling equipment to be manufactured  assembled  tested and delivered by our rig technology segment 
the following factors  in addition to others not listed  could reduce our margins on these contracts  adversely affect our position in the market or subject us to contractual penalties our failure to adequately estimate costs for making this drilling equipment  our inability to deliver equipment that meets contracted technical requirements  our inability to maintain our quality standards during the design and manufacturing process  our inability to secure parts made by third party vendors at reasonable costs and within required timeframes  unexpected increases in the costs of raw materials  and our inability to manage unexpected delays due to weather  shipyard access  labor shortages or other factors beyond our control 
the company s existing contracts for rig equipment generally carry down payment and progress billing terms favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects and do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience 
however  unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
competition in our industry could ultimately lead to lower revenues and earnings 
the oilfield products and services industry is highly competitive 
we compete with national  regional and foreign competitors in each of our current major product lines 
certain of these competitors may have greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than us  and may be in a better competitive position 
the following competitive actions can each affect our revenues and earnings price changes  new product and technology introductions  and improvements in availability and delivery 
in addition  certain foreign jurisdictions and government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies or regulations which may give local nationals in these countries competitive advantages 
competition in our industry could lead to lower revenues and earnings 

table of contents we have aggressively expanded our businesses and intend to maintain an aggressive growth strategy 
we have aggressively expanded and grown our businesses during the past several years  through acquisitions and investment in internal growth 
we anticipate that we will continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy but we cannot assure you that attractive acquisitions will be available to us at reasonable prices or at all 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own or that our management will be able to manage effectively the increased size of the company or operate any new lines of business 
any inability on the part of management to integrate and manage acquired businesses and their assumed liabilities could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
in addition  we may need to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
future acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased interest expense  increased financial leverage or decreased operating income for the company  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
our operating results have fluctuated during recent years and these fluctuations may continue 
we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results in the past 
we cannot assure that we will realize earnings growth or that earnings in any particular quarter will not fall short of either a prior fiscal quarter or investors expectations 
the following factors  in addition to others not listed  may affect our quarterly operating results in the future fluctuations in the oil and gas industry  competition  the ability to service the debt obligations of the company  the ability to identify strategic acquisitions at reasonable prices  the ability to manage and control operating costs of the company  fluctuations in political and economic conditions in the united states and abroad  and the ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
there are risks associated with our presence in international markets  including political or economic instability  currency restrictions  and trade and economic sanctions 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from operations outside the united states based on revenue destination 
our foreign operations include significant operations in canada  europe  the middle east  africa  southeast asia  latin america and other international markets 
our revenues and operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries  including uncertain political and economic environments  which may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies  or are subject to governmental policies  giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals 
as a result of these policies  we may rely on joint ventures  license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries 
in addition  political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationships between us and government owned petroleum companies 
our operations outside the united states could also expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the united states or other governments or organizations 
the us department of justice doj  the us securities and exchange commission and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trading sanctions laws  the foreign corrupt practices act and other statutes 
under trading sanctions laws  the us and other governments may seek to impose modifications to business practices  including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries  and modifications to compliance programs  which may increase compliance costs 
if any of the risks described above materialize  it could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
we have received federal grand jury subpoenas and subsequent inquiries from governmental agencies requesting records related to our compliance with export trade laws and regulations 
we have cooperated fully with agents from the department of justice  the bureau of industry and security  the office of foreign assets control  and us immigration and customs enforcement in responding to the inquiries 
we have also cooperated with an informal inquiry from the securities and exchange commission in connection with the inquiries previously made by the aforementioned federal agencies 
we have conducted our own internal review of this matter 
at the conclusion of our internal review in the fourth quarter of  we identified possible areas of concern and discussed these areas of concern with the relevant agencies 
we are currently negotiating a potential resolution with the agencies involved related to these matters 
we currently anticipate that any administrative fine or penalty agreed to as part of a resolution would be within established accruals  and would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
to the extent a resolution is not negotiated as anticipated  we cannot predict the timing or effect that any resulting government actions may have on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents the results of our operations are subject to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we earn revenues  pay expenses and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the us dollar  including  but not limited to  the canadian dollar  the euro  the british pound sterling  the norwegian krone  the venezuelan bolivar and the south korean won 
approximately of our revenue was derived from sales outside the united states 
because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars  we must translate revenues and expenses into us dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period 
thus  increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar against other currencies in which our operations are conducted will affect our revenues and operating income 
because of the geographic diversity of our operations  weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time 
we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our net exposure to currency exchange fluctuations 
we had forward contracts with a notional amount of  million with a fair value of million as of december   to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we are also subject to risks that the counterparties to these contracts fail to meet the terms of our foreign currency contracts 
we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates would not affect our financial results 
an impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets could reduce our earnings 
the company has approximately billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include but are not limited to a significant reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling  a significant reduction in profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors  a significant reduction in worldwide well remediation activity  a significant reduction in capital investment by other oilfield service companies  or a significant increase in worldwide inventories of oil or gas 
the timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge  which could be material  would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of management judgment 
if we were to determine that any of our remaining balance of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets was impaired  we would record an immediate charge to earnings with a corresponding reduction in stockholders equity  resulting in an increase in balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization 
see additional discussion on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in critical accounting estimates of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies that govern environmental protection  zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses 
our businesses are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies governing environmental protection  zoning and other matters 
these laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future 
if existing regulatory requirements change  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
we cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations 
governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
under these circumstances  we might be required to reduce or cease operations or conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
our businesses expose us to potential environmental liability 
our businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the environment  which could result in personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  or environmental damage and suspension of operations 

table of contents our current and past activities  as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries  could result in our facing substantial environmental  regulatory and other liabilities 
these could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations 
these liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the following theories negligence  strict liability  breach of contract with customers  or as a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business  which is normally the case 
we may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental liabilities 
while we maintain liability insurance  this insurance is subject to coverage limits 
in addition  certain policies do not provide coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination 
we face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies  or the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
even a partially uninsured claim  if successful and of significant size  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs or reduce demand for our products 
environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change 
the adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases  including the imposition of fees or taxes  could adversely impact our operations and financial condition 
the us congress is currently working on legislation to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the united states  which includes establishing cap and trade programs 
in addition to the pending climate legislation  the us environmental protection agency has proposed regulations that would require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities  and may issue final rules this year 
these changes in the legal and regulatory environment could reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
we had revenues of of total revenue from one of our customers for the year ended december  the loss of this customer samsung heavy industries or a significant reduction in its purchases could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings 
the moratorium on deepwater drilling in the us gulf of mexico and its consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a moratorium on deepwater drilling in the us gulf of mexico was enacted during the second quarter of following the macondo well blowout and oil spill 
even though such moratorium has been lifted  any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas drilling and production activity as a result of such moratorium or permitting issues in this area could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger systems and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of the our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

oil gas equipment and services market worldwide  developed economies turned down in late as looming housing related asset write downs at major financial institutions paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis 
major central banks responded vigorously through  but a credit driven worldwide economic recession developed nonetheless 
developed economies struggled to recover throughout and  facing additional economic weakness related to potential sovereign debt defaults in europe 
as a result  commodity prices  including oil and gas prices  have been volatile 
after rising steadily for six years to peak at around per barrel west texas intermediate crude prices earlier in  oil prices collapsed back to average per barrel during the first quarter of  but have slowly recovered into the per barrel range by mid where they held relatively steady since although the fourth quarter of dipped to average per barrel 
after trading in the range of to an mmbtu from to  north american gas prices declined to average per mmbtu in the third quarter of gas prices recovered modestly  trading up above six months later  but then slowly settled into the to per mmbtu through before turning down sharply in early to the range fourth quarter recovered to average per mmbtu 
the recent gas price collapse appears to be a direct result of rising gas supply out of unconventional shale reservoir development across north america  including gas associated with liquids production from shales 
the steadily rising oil and gas prices seen between and led to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe by  but activity slowed sharply in with lower oil and gas prices and tightening credit availability 
strengthening oil prices since then have led to steadily rising oil drilling activity over the past two years 
the count of rigs actively drilling in the us as measured by baker hughes a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending peaked at  rigs in september  but decreased to a low of in june  us rig count increased steadily to  by late  but began to decline with lower gas prices to average  rigs during the fourth quarter of many oil and gas operators reliant on external financing to fund their drilling programs significantly curtailed their drilling activity in  but drilling recovered across north america as gas prices improved 
recently low gas prices have caused operators to trim drilling  driving the average us gas rig count down from the fourth quarter of  to an average of in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents however  with high oil prices  many have redirected drilling efforts towards unconventional shale plays targeting oil  rather than gas 
for the fourth quarter of  oil directed drilling rose to almost of the total domestic drilling effort  and  while the average oil directed drilling rig count declined by from the third quarter to  rigs  it remains near its highest levels in the us since the early s 
most international activity is driven by oil exploration and production by national oil companies  which has historically been less susceptible to short term commodity price swings  but  the international rig count exhibited modest declines nonetheless  falling from its september peak of  to in august recently international drilling rebounded due to high oil prices  climbing back to  in june before falling back to  in december 
during the company saw its petroleum services supplies and its distribution transmission margins affected most acutely by a drilling downturn  through both volume and price declines 
resumption of drilling activity since enabled both of these segments to gain volume  stabilize and lift pricing  and improve margins since the fourth quarter of the company s rig technology segment was less impacted by the downturn owing to its high level of contracted backlog  which it executed well 
it posted higher revenues in than as a result 
its revenues declined in as its backlog declined  but increased in as orders for new offshore rigs began to increase 
the recent economic decline beginning in late followed an extended period of high drilling activity which fueled strong demand for oilfield services between and incremental drilling activity through the upswing shifted toward harsh environments  employing increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves 
higher utilization of drilling rigs tested the capability of the world s fleet of rigs  much of which is old and of limited capability 
technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built 
the industry invested little during the late s and s on new drilling equipment  but drilling technology progressed steadily nonetheless  as the company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling 
as a consequence  the safety  reliability  and efficiency of new  modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work today 
drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells  more complex wells  highly deviated wells and horizontal wells  tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities 
the drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical components of a rig  which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement 
this process was accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity 
drilling consumes rigs  more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster 
the industry responded by launching many new rig construction projects since  to retool the existing fleet of jackup rigs according to riglogix  nearly of the existing jackup rigs are more than years old  replace older mechanical and dc electric land rigs with improved ac power  electronic controls  automatic pipe handling and rapid rigup and rigdown technology  and build out additional deepwater floating drilling rigs  including semisubmersibles and drillships  to employ recent advancements in deepwater drilling to exploit unexplored deepwater basins 
we believe that the newer rigs offer considerably higher efficiency  safety  and capability  and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet 
as a result of these trends the company s rig technology segment grew its backlog of capital equipment orders from billion at june   to billion at september  however  as a result of the credit crisis and slowing drilling activity  orders declined below amounts flowing out of backlog as revenue  causing the backlog to decline to billion by june  the backlog increased steadily since  as drillers began ordering more than the company shipped out of backlog  and finished the fourth quarter of at a record billion 
approximately billion of these orders are scheduled to flow out as revenue during  with the balance flowing out in and beyond 
of this backlog  of the total is for equipment destined for offshore operations  with destined for land 
equipment destined for international markets totaled of the backlog 
segment performance the rig technology segment generated billion in revenues and billion in operating profit or of sales during compared to the prior year revenues improved  however  operating profit improved year over year due to a broad change in the segment s business mix  which led to lower margins 
offshore projects contracted at high prices in and were manufactured in low cost environments in  resulting in high margins for the group 
as these projects were completed and replaced with lower priced projects  margins declined basis points from the prior year 
for the fourth quarter of  the segment generated billion in revenues and million in operating profit or of sales 
compared to the prior quarter revenues increased million or  and operating profit increased million 
operating leverage or flow through was from the third quarter to the fourth quarter 
compared to the fourth quarter of segment revenues grew million or  and operating profit increased million 
year over year operating leverage or flow through was 
margins have moved down steadily since mid due to an adverse mix shift in the segment  the addition of lower margin acquisitions  and incremental expenses to support several strategic growth initiatives 
the mix shift arises from offshore projects contracted at high prices in and  which were subsequently manufactured in low cost environments in and  resulting in high margins for the group which peaked in the third quarter of as these projects have been completed and replaced with lower priced projects  margins have gradually declined 
revenue out of backlog increased sequentially and increased year over year 
non backlog revenue  which is predominantly aftermarket spares and services  increased sequentially and increased from the fourth 
table of contents quarter of orders for seven deepwater floating rig equipment packages  and three spare bop stacks contributed to total order additions to backlog of billion during the fourth quarter 
interest in offshore rig construction has remained strong as announced dayrates for deepwater offshore rigs are increasing  rig building costs have stabilized at attractive levels  and financing appears to be available for most established drillers 
the company continues to tender additional new offshore rig projects for petrobras to shipyards and drilling contractors  which are to be built in brazil 
however  further potential bookings of any additional offshore rigs for brazil may continue to be subject to delays 
the segment s well intervention and stimulation product sales increased sequentially  as the delivery of several large projects to international customers more than offset a continued decline in demand for pressure pumping equipment 
the petroleum services supplies segment generated billion in revenue and billion in operating profit  or of sales  for the full year compared to the prior year revenue increased  and operating leverage or flow through was 
for the fourth quarter of  the segment generated billion in revenue and million in operating profit  or of sales 
compared to the prior quarter revenue increased million or  but operating profit declined million 
sequentially  high year end sales of drill pipe and large outside diameter od connectors  combined with revenue growth in the international coating business  more than offset the lower sales of downhole tools  fluid end expendables and coiled tubing  which were directly attributable to the reduction in us land drilling and well service activity 
compared to the fourth quarter of revenues increased million or and operating leverage or flow through was 
approximately of the segment s fourth quarter sales were into north american markets  and of sales were into international markets 
the distribution transmission segment generated billion in revenue and million in operating profit or of sales during revenues improved from for the fourth quarter of  the segment generated billion in revenue and million in operating profit or of sales 
revenues declined million or from the third quarter of while operating profit increased million 
compared to the fourth quarter of  revenues increased million or and flow through or operating leverage was 
sequentially  the overall decline in us drilling and well service activity negatively impacted day to day sales of maintenance  repair and operating consumables  as well as sales of tubular products 
the year over year revenue growth was due primarily to the acquisitions of wilson and ce franklin  made during the second and third quarters of  respectively 
approximately of the group s fourth quarter sales were into north american markets and into international markets 
outlook following the credit market downturn  global recession  and lower commodity prices of  we saw signs of stabilization and recovery in many of our markets in and into  led by higher drilling activity in north america and slowly improving international drilling activity 
order levels for new deepwater drilling rigs have rebounded sharply  and the rig technology segment continues to experience a high level of interest as dayrates for deepwater offshore rigs continue to improve 
still  margins  which were in the fourth quarter of  may be temporarily challenged to expand  due to lower margin contributions from recent subsea production equipment acquisitions  a soft outlook for land drilling  workover and pressure pumping equipment markets in north america  in view of low gas and natural gas liquids prices  and by incremental expenses to support long term strategic growth initiatives 
our outlook for the company s petroleum services supplies segment and distribution transmission segment remains closely tied to the rig count  particularly in north america 
the fourth quarter saw domestic rig counts continue to decline  resulting in an average us rig count in december that was down from the average us rig count in january of  and an average canadian rig count in december that was down from the same period in as a result  pricing and volumes are beginning to come under pressure as pressure pumpers  drilling contractors and oil companies reduce operating and capital expenditures 
additionally  economic weakness may pressure oil prices  which could lead to further activity declines  particularly among north american operators which may rely on cash flows from gas production and or external financing to fund their drilling operations 
in contrast  activity generally seems to be continuing to increase in most international markets outside north america 
the company believes it is well positioned  and should benefit from its strong balance sheet and capitalization  access to credit  global infrastructure  broad product and service offering  installed base of equipment  and a record level of contracted orders 
in the event of a market downturn  the company also believes that its long history of cost control and downsizing in response to slowing market conditions  and of executing strategic acquisitions during difficult periods will enable it to capitalize on new opportunities to effect new organic growth and acquisition initiatives 
still the recovery of the world economy continues to move forward with a great deal of uncertainty as the world watches the sovereign debt crises in several european countries unfold  market turbulence and general global economic worries 
if such global economic uncertaintanties develop adversely  world oil and gas prices could be impacted which in turn could negatively impact the worldwide rig count and the company s future financial results

in addition  the acquisitions of nkt and enerflow  occurring towards the beginning of the second quarter of  contributed to the increase in revenue for rig technology 
as the segment moved into the second half of  it saw continued strong deepwater offshore demand as well as a strong demand in international markets with strong revenue growth in coiled tubing equipment  wireline equipment and land rigs sold internationally 
north american markets  however  saw a decrease in demand for land drilling as both gas and oil plays have decreased production 
this is evidenced by a decrease in rig count in the us during and has resulted in lower sales of land rigs and jackups in the us as the segment moved into the second half of the average rig count in the us during the fourth quarter of decreased to  rigs from the first quarter average of  rigs 
rig technology revenues could decrease as it enters due to the decrease in demand for pressure pumping equipment 
operating profit from rig technology was  million which included million in other costs related to acquisitions for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to operating profit percentage decreased to  from in partially contributing to the decrease in operating profit percentage was a decrease in the average margin of revenue out of backlog as contracts signed during and contain less favorable margins compared to contracts won during the order ramp up from to also contributing to the decrease in operating profit percentage were integration costs related to the nkt and enerflow acquisitions made during the second quarter of as well as considerable start up costs associated with construction of an nov flexibles plant in brazil  and the opening of a new technical college in korea 
coiled tubing equipment  wireline equipment and land rigs sold later in the year were primarily driven by large international projects that were secured at lower than average margins 
finally  increased fpso related revenues  with operating profit lower than other parts of this segment  were dilutive to overall rig technology operating profit margins 
as the segment enters  we anticipate continued pricing pressures in north america coupled with a continuing shift in product mix that includes a growing percentage of brazil and fpso related revenues 
the rig technology segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business 
new orders are added to backlog only when the company receives a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project 
the capital equipment backlog was billion at december   an increase of billion from backlog of billion at december  
table of contents petroleum services supplies revenue from petroleum services supplies for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of  million compared to the year ended december  strong shale plays in north america lead to an increase in revenue for the petroleum services supplies segment during the first half of compared to acquisitions made during the year such as fiberspar corporation and zap lok pipeline systems  inc contributed to the increase in revenue for compared to full period results of ameron as well as other strategic acquisitions made during in the us  the uk  the netherlands  singapore  malaysia and brazil also contributed to the increase in revenue for this segment in compared to moving into the second half of  while stronger than in  compared to the first half of  the segment saw a decrease in north american activity as evidenced in the decrease in us rig count throughout the year 
petroleum services supplies revenues could decrease as it enters as many of its businesses enter with diminished backlog and us based drilling contractors as well as service firms have been hesitant to release new orders 
operating profit from petroleum services supplies was  million which included million in other costs related to acquisitions for the year ended december  compared to  million for  an increase of million 
operating profit percentage increased to up from in this increase is primarily due to increased volume  favorable pricing and cost reductions within most business units within the segment during the first half of compared to the same period in however  as the segment moved into the second half of the year  due to the decrease in north american market activity  it began to experience pricing pressures across a number of products in the north american land market  coupled with a shift in product mix  which led to lower margins 
most notably  the continued reduction of north american land activity led to pricing pressures and an overall reduction in volume for the segments downhole tools  fiberglass pipe  coiled dubing  and fluid end expendables products 
while declines in various product lines were offset partially with growth in the drill pipe  xl systems and tuboscope products  overall margins still continued to decline towards the end of the year 
as the segment enters  we anticipate continued pricing pressures in north america coupled with a possible decrease in volume 
distribution transmission revenue from distribution transmission was  million for the year ended december   an increase of  million compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of wilson during the second quarter of and ce franklin during the third quarter of distribution transmission revenues are expected to increase as it enters as it realizes full period results for its acquisitions 
operating profit from distribution transmission was million which included million in other costs related to acquisitions for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  operating profit percentage decreased to  from in increased volume  greater cost efficiencies and continued favorable pricing which related to strong demand for this segment contributed to an increase in operating profit percentages for this segment during the first half of however  the impact of businesses acquired during combined with lower market activity resulted in margins dropping slightly for the year 
in addition  other costs incurred for the expense recognition associated with acquired current assets stepped up to fair value during purchase accounting also contributed to the decrease in operating profit percentage 
the majority of the stepped up value related to inventory and was fully recognized by december  as the segment enters  we anticipate continued pricing pressures in north america coupled with a possible decrease in volume 
unallocated expenses and eliminations unallocated expenses and eliminations in operating profit were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increased activity along all segments which in turn resulted in higher intersegment eliminations 
equity income in unconsolidated affiliates equity income in unconsolidated affiliates was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased equity earnings from the company s investment in voest alpine tubulars vat located in kindberg  austria 
other income expense  net other income expense  net were expenses of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to foreign exchange losses and increased bank charges and fees 

table of contents provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared to for compared to the us statutory rate  the effective tax rate was positively impacted in the period by the effect of lower tax rates on income earned in foreign jurisdictions  foreign dividends net of foreign tax credits  the deduction in the us for manufacturing activities and foreign exchange losses for tax reporting in norway 
the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of increased valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets associated with excess foreign tax credits carried to future periods 
during  the company recorded certain tax benefits totaling million primarily from the repatriation of certain non us earnings that increased our us foreign tax credits 
these credits are available to be used by the company as foreign tax credits in the us over a year period 
these excess foreign tax credits were recognized as deferred tax assets in the balance sheet and would be realized as a reduction of future income tax payments in the us however  because of uncertainty associated with the company s ability to fully utilize these credits in the future  a valuation allowance of million was recorded in the period 
the net result of these transactions reduced income tax expense by million in the period

operating profit from petroleum services supplies was  million for compared to million for  an increase of million 
operating profit percentage increased to  up from in this increase is primarily due to increased volume with a strong north american demand fueled by an increase in rig count as well as continued favorable pricing within most business units within the segment 
the increase was partially offset by lower levels of activity in the middle east due to continued unrest in that region 
this unrest resulted in the write down  in the first quarter  of libyan assets of million  mostly related to accounts receivable affected by sanctions enacted during the quarter along with the write off of certain inventory and fixed assets in the country 
the company s rig technology and distribution transmission segments incurred million of such asset write downs during the first quarter for a total of million in libyan asset write downs incurred by the company 
distribution transmission revenue from distribution transmission totaled  million for  an increase of million from this increase was primarily attributable to increased rig count activity in canada and the us internationally  the segments mono business unit also contributed to the increase in revenues as demand for its power sections and artificial lift products increased in compared to in addition  strategic acquisitions in the us and the us contributed to the increase in revenue for this segment 
operating profit from distribution transmission  increased in to million compared to million in operating profit percentage increased to in from in primarily due to greater cost efficiencies and better pricing related to strong demand fueled by an increase in canada and us rig count activity 
this increase was partially offset by rig moves towards liquid shale plays  drill site construction delays and weather issues towards the end of the year in certain markets in which this segment participates 
unallocated expenses and eliminations unallocated expenses and eliminations in operating profit were million for the year ended december  compared to million for this increase is primarily due to the increased activity along all segments which in turn resulted in higher intersegment eliminations and higher incentive compensation 
equity income in unconsolidated affiliates equity income in unconsolidated affiliates was million for compared to million for  a million increase which was primarily related to increased equity earnings from the company s investment in voest alpine tubulars vat located in kindberg  austria 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was expense of million in compared to expense of million in the decrease in expense was primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses in compared to the venezuelan government officially devalued the venezuelan bolivar against the us dollar in the company converted its venezuela ledgers to us dollar functional currency and devalued monetary assets resulting in a million foreign exchange loss during see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates 
lower exchange losses were partially offset by increased bank charges 
the increase in bank charges is primarily due to an increase in our standby letters of credit coupled with increased bank activity through growth both internally and through 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared to for compared to the us statutory rate  the effective tax rate was positively impacted in the period by the effect of lower tax rates on income in foreign jurisdictions  an increase in the benefit of the manufacturing deduction as a result of increasing income in the us  plus the effect of tax rate reductions on timing differences in foreign jurisdictions 
this was partially offset by additional prior period taxes on foreign dividends 
the impact of these prior period discrete items is not material to any individual prior period 

table of contents non gaap financial measures and reconciliations in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by gaap  we disclose various non gaap financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases and other public disclosures 
the primary non gaap financial measures we focus on are i operating profit excluding other costs  ii operating profit percentage excluding other costs  and iii diluted earnings per share excluding other costs 
each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain other costs and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of each of these non gaap financial measures to its most comparable gaap financial measure is included below

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company assesses liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund operating  investing and financing activities 
the company remains in a strong financial position  with resources available to reinvest in existing businesses  strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to meet short and long term objectives 
the company believes that cash on hand  cash generated from expected results of operations and amounts available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations  anticipated working capital needs and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures  debt and interest payments and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  million  and total debt of  million 
at december   cash and cash equivalents were  million and total debt was million 
the  million reduction in the net cash cash less debt balance in was due primarily to  million in cash paid for acquisitions 
a significant portion of the consolidated cash balances are maintained in accounts in various foreign subsidiaries and  if such amounts were transferred among countries or repatriated to the us  such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations 
of the  million of cash and cash equivalents at december   approximately  million is held outside the us of this amount  approximately  million is considered permanently reinvested and is available to fund operations and other growth of foreign subsidiaries including  but not limited to  capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital needs 
of the  million of cash and cash equivalents at december   approximately  million was held outside the us and approximately  million was considered permanently reinvested 
if opportunities to invest in the us are greater than available cash balances  rather than repatriating this cash  the company may choose to borrow against its revolving credit facility 
on february   the company completed its previously announced acquisition of robbins myers  inc for approximately billion in cash 
the company borrowed approximately billion under the billion revolving credit facility and used approximately billion of cash on hand to fund the acquisition 
new revolving credit facility on september   the company entered into a new five year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions 
this new credit facility replaced early the company s previous billion revolving credit facility and provides for aggregate multicurrency borrowings up to billion 
in addition  the company has the option to increase aggregate borrowing availability by an additional billion  subject to syndication approval 
interest under the new credit facility is based upon libor  nibor or euribor plus subject to a ratings based grid  or the prime rate 
the terms of the new credit facility provide for a financial covenant regarding maximum debt to capitalization 
at december   the company was in compliance with the financial covenant under the new credit facility 
redemption of unsecured senior notes due on november   the company repaid million of its unsecured senior notes and million of its unsecured senior notes 
both series of unsecured senior notes were repaid using available cash balances 
issuance of unsecured senior notes due  and on november   the company issued the following  million of unsecured senior notes due  billion of unsecured senior notes due and billion of unsecured senior notes due the net proceeds were  million  after deducting million in underwriting fees and a million discount 
interest on each series of notes is due on june and december of each year  beginning on june  the company may redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time at the applicable redemption  plus accrued interest  if any  to the redemption date 
at december   the company was in compliance with the covenants under the indenture governing the senior notes 
the company s outstanding debt at december  was  million and consisted of million in senior notes  million in senior notes   million in senior notes and  million in senior notes  and other debt of million 
at december   there were no borrowings under the new billion credit facility  however  there were million in outstanding letters of credit issued  resulting in  million of funds available 
the company also had  million of additional outstanding letters of credit at december   primarily in norway  that are under various bilateral committed letter of credit facilities 
other letters of credit are issued as bid bonds and performance bonds 

table of contents the following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by operating activities  net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by used in financing activities for the periods presented in millions years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  million in before changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  cash was provided by operations primarily through net income of  million plus non cash charges of million and million in a dividend received from voest alpine tubulars  an unconsolidated affiliate  less million in equity income 
net changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  used  million in compared to million used in due to an increase in market activity during compared to  revenue and backlog increased which is reflected in increased accounts receivable as well as a buildup in inventory 
increased market activity during also resulted in higher taxes paid  higher accounts payable and an increase in both costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs with costs incurred on major rig projects outpacing customer progress and milestone invoicing 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of  million in net cash used in investing activities continued to primarily be the result of acquisition activity and capital expenditures both of which increased in compared to the company used  million for the purpose of strategic acquisitions during compared to  million in in addition  due to the continued growth in the company worldwide  both organically and through acquisition  the company used million during for capital expenditures compared to million in during  the company used a combination of its cash on hand  borrowings from its revolving credit facility and the issuance of senior notes to fund its acquisitions and capital expenditures 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  million in compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in the change related to a shift from the company primarily repaying debt during to the company refinancing its revolving credit facility  expanding it to billion  and issuing three truanches of senior notes for a total of billion in senior notes during funds received as a result of borrowing in were used to finance working capital and acquisitions and to make tax payments 
proceeds from stock options exercised increased to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the company again increased its dividend to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the effect of the change in exchange rates on cash flows was a positive million and a negative million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements  dividends and financing obligations 
we intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates  but the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
we continue to expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including the unborrowed portion of the credit facility or new debt issuances  but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us 

table of contents a summary of the company s outstanding contractual obligations at december  is as follows in millions payment due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations total debt operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments standby letters of credit as of december   the company had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long term construction contracts  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  impairments of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  service and product warranties and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
revenue recognition under long term construction contracts the company uses the percentage of completion method to account for certain long term construction contracts in the rig technology segment 
these long term construction contracts include the following characteristics the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications  the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts  and construction projects often have progress payments 
this method requires the company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project  progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date  all of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin the company recognizes in each reporting period 
the company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project  taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin 
significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management 
factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access  weather  production efficiencies  availability and costs of labor  materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in risk factors 
these factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the company s estimates and materially impact the company s future reported earnings 
historically  the company s estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues and gross profits on percentage of completion contracts 
based upon an analysis of percentage of completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at december  and  adjustments representing the differences between the estimated and actual results to all outstanding contracts resulted in net increases to gross profit margins of million on billion of outstanding contracts and million on billion of outstanding contracts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
while the company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage of completion accounting  the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods 
the company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts on a contract to date basis of billion at december  allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the company to make judgments regarding future events and trends 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the company s portfolio on an individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends 
this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience  current aging status of the customer accounts  and financial condition of the company s customers 
based on a review of these factors  the company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues come from international oil companies  international shipyards  international oilfield service companies  and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
therefore  the company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions 
if worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate  the creditworthiness of the company s customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these receivables  and additional allowances could be required 
at december  and  allowance for bad debts totaled million and million  or and of gross accounts receivable  respectively 
historically  the company s charge offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  because of the risk factors mentioned above  changes in estimates could become material in future periods 

table of contents inventory reserves inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand  assumptions about future demand and market conditions  and estimates about potential alternative uses  which are usually limited 
the company s inventory consists of specialized spare parts  work in process  and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the company s large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield 
customers rely on the company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner 
the company s estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity  which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
at december  and  inventory reserves totaled million and million  or and of gross inventory  respectively 
while inventory reserves and accruals have not had a material impact on the company s financial results for the periods covered in this report  changes in worldwide oil and gas activity  or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete  could require the company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory 
such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives 
the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
the forecasts are dependent upon assumptions regarding oil and gas prices  the general outlook for economic growth worldwide  available financing for the company s customers  political stability in major oil and gas producing areas  and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell  among other factors 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast as well as our weighted average cost of capital  both key assumptions used in our calculation 
changes to these assumptions  including  but not limited to sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity  or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company has approximately billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of december  generally accepted accounting principles require the company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include  but not limited to further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts forecasts  further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas  significant additional deterioration of external financing for our customers  higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole 
fair value of the reporting units is determined in accordance with asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures using significant unobservable inputs  or level in the fair value hierarchy 
these inputs are based on internal management estimates  forecasts and judgments  using a combination of three methods discounted cash flow  comparable companies  and representative transactions 
while the company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value  the company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and further support management s expectations  where possible 
the discounted cash flow is based on management s short term and long term forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit 
the two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment  which bear the risk of change and could impact the company s goodwill impairment analysis  include the cash flow from operations from each of the company s individual business units and the weighted average cost of capital 
the starting point for each of the reporting unit s cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated forecast 
the detailed planning and forecasting process takes into consideration a multitude of factors including worldwide rig activity  inflationary forces  pricing strategies  customer analysis  operational issues  competitor analysis  capital spending requirements  working capital needs  customer needs to replace aging equipment  increased complexity of drilling  new technology  and existing backlog among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections 
cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short term or long term trend 
the annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year 
the valuation techniques used in the annual test were consistent with those used during previous testing 
the inputs used in the annual test were updated for current market conditions and forecasts 
based on its analysis  the company did not report any impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for the years ended december   and purchase price allocation of acquisitions the company allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
the company uses all available information to estimate fair values including quoted market prices  the carrying value of acquired assets  and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows all level unobservable inputs 
the company engages third party appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of inventories  identifiable intangible assets  and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  could materially impact the company s results of operations 

table of contents service and product warranties the company provides service and warranty policies on certain of its products 
the company accrues liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with asc topic contingencies asc topic 
adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change 
in addition  the company incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues and accrues for them when they are encountered 
the company monitors the actual cost of performing these discretionary services and adjusts the accrual based on the most current information available 
at december  and  service and product warranties totaled million and million  respectively 
income taxes the company is a us registered company and is subject to income taxes in the us and other jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the company operates and income is earned 
the company s annual tax provision is based on taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
the determination and evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year 
the company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation  which could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries 
the company maintains liabilities for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
the annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the company considers appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain operating expenses that may not be deductible in foreign jurisdictions 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means 
the company is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments 
the company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures under the guidance in asc topic income taxes asc topic 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year  the effect will be recognized in the period of the event 
the company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the company intends to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the company s valuation allowances 
the realization of remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income 
any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings 
the company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should the company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  the company may be required to record additional taxes 
unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the company makes a determination each period whether to permanently reinvest these earnings 
if  as a result of these reassessments  the company distributes these earnings in the future  additional tax liabilities would result  offset by any available foreign tax credits 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standard update no 
intangibles goodwill and other topic that amends the accounting guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the amendments in this accounting standard update are intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test 
the amendments also enhance the consistency of impairment testing guidance among long lived asset categories by permitting an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to calculate the asset s fair value when testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment  which is equivalent to the impairment testing requirements for other long lived assets 
the amendments in this accounting standard update are effective for interim and annual impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the company tests its indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
additional information concerning each of these matters follows foreign currency exchange rates we have extensive operations in foreign countries 
the net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency 
these operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency  which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income 
during the years ended december   and  the company reported foreign currency losses of million  million and million  respectively 
gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
strengthening of currencies against the us dollar may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency 
some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those us dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency 
similarly some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies  but have associated us dollar costs  which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
in order to mitigate that risk  we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes

table of contents the company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies for transactional exposures totaling million and translation exposures totaling million as of december   excluding trade receivables and payables  which approximate fair value 
these market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities 
the company estimates that a hypothetical movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on the transactional exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by million and the translational exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect the future fair value by million 
the counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis 
in the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential 
during the first quarter of  the venezuelan government officially devalued the venezuelan bolivar against the us dollar 
as a result the company converted its venezuela ledgers to us dollar functional currency  devalued monetary assets resulting in a million charge  and wrote down certain accounts receivable in view of deteriorating business conditions in venezuela  resulting in an additional million charge 
during the first quarter of  the venezuelan government again officially devalued the venezuelan bolivar against the us dollar 
as a result  the company expects to incur approximately million in devaluation charges in the first quarter of the company s net investment in venezuela was million at december  interest rate risk at december   our long term borrowings consisted of million in senior notes  million in senior notes   million in senior notes and  million in senior notes 
we occasionally have borrowings under our credit facility  and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements 
these instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either libor  nibor or euribor  or at the prime interest rate 
under our credit facility  we may  at our option  fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over libor  nibor or euribor for days to six months
