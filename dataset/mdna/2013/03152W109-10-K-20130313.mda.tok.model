item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview amicus therapeutics  inc amicus is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule drugs known as pharmacological chaperones 
we are developing pharmacological chaperones as next generation medicines for a range of rare and orphan diseases  with a focus on improved therapies for lysosomal storage disorders 
our development programs include novel small molecules as monotherapy treatments and in combination with the current standard treatment for fabry and other lysosomal storage diseases  enzyme replacement therapy ert 
our chaperone advanced replacement therapy  or chart  programs include chaperones co administered with currently marketed erts  as well as proprietary therapeutic enzymes co formulated with our pharmacological chaperones as next generation erts 
we believe that our pharmacological chaperone and chart platform technologies  our advanced product pipeline  a strong balance sheet and our strategic collaboration with glaxosmithkline plc gsk uniquely position us at the forefront of developing therapies for rare and orphan diseases 
we are developing our lead product candidate  migalastat hcl for fabry disease  in collaboration with gsk as a monotherapy and in combination with ert 
current development within our fabry program includes two monotherapy phase global registration studies for patients with genetic mutations identified as amenable to this pharmacological chaperone in a cell based assay study and study  a recently completed phase study investigating migalastat hcl co administered with currently marketed erts study  and the preclinical development of migalastat hcl co formulated with a proprietary investigational ert 
program status migalastat hcl for fabry disease as a monotherapy phase global registration program in study  we are comparing migalastat hcl to placebo to potentially support the submission of a new drug application  or nda  to the us food and drug administration fda for marketing approval in the united states as well as to other regulatory agencies 
study randomized patients males and females diagnosed with fabry disease who had genetic mutations considered amenable to chaperone monotherapy in a cell based assay 
for the month  double blind period stage patients were randomized to migalastat hcl mg or placebo on an every other day qod oral dosing schedule 
during the month period of study stage patients continued treatment with migalastat hcl or switched from placebo to migalastat hcl 
the primary analysis compared the number of responders in the migalastat hcl versus placebo groups in stage  based on a or greater reduction in interstitial capillary globotriaosylceramide gl as measured in kidney biopsies 
pathologists blinded to biopsy sequence are using the published  quantitative barisoni lipid inclusion scoring system with virtual microscopy bliss vm for the histological evaluation of interstitial capillary gl in kidney biopsies from baseline to month stage and from baseline to month stage secondary endpoints for study include safety and tolerability  urine gl and kidney function 
in december  amicus and gsk announced top line six month stage results from study while encouraging  these results did not achieve statistical significance p according to the pre specified primary endpoint analysis 
data from stage are anticipated in the third quarter of a meeting with the fda is anticipated in mid to discuss a us conditional approval pathway for migalastat hcl under subpart h 
study is a randomized  open label month study investigating the safety and efficacy of migalastat hcl mg  every other day to current standard of care erts fabrazyme and 
table of contents replagal to support global registration 
in december  this study achieved full enrollment of patients  who were randomized to switch from ert to migalastat hcl or remain on ert 
the study recruited males and females with fabry disease and genetic mutations shown to be amenable to migalastat hcl monotherapy in a cell based assay 
all subjects had been receiving ert infusions for a minimum of months at least months at the labeled dose 
data is anticipated in the second half of on the primary outcome measure  which is renal function assessed by iohexol glomerular filtration rate gfr at months 
migalastat hcl combination programs for fabry disease study is an open label phase drug drug interaction study that evaluated the effects of a single oral dose of migalastat hcl mg or mg co administered prior to the currently marketed erts for fabry disease fabrazyme or replagal in males with fabry disease 
results from this study presented in february demonstrated an increase in a gal a enzyme levels  the enzyme deficient in fabry patients  in plasma and in tissue following co administration of migalastat hcl with ert versus ert alone 
in addition to investigating migalastat hcl co administered with ert  we are currently conducting preclinical formulation and ind enabling studies of intravenous treatment of migalastat hcl co formulated with jcr proprietary investigational recombinant human a gal a enzyme jr 
we believe this chaperone ert co formulated product has the potential to enter the clinic in late or early at chart programs for pompe disease we also continue to advance our pharmacological chaperone at duvoglustat hcl co administered with the only approved erts myozyme lumizyme for pompe disease 
we recently completed a phase safety and pk study study that investigated single ascending oral doses of at mg  mg  mg  and mg co administered with myozyme or lumizyme in patients with pompe disease 
each patient received one infusion of ert alone  and then a single dose of at just prior to the next ert infusion 
results from this study showed an increase in gaa enzyme activity in plasma and muscle compared to ert alone 
based on these results  we expect to initiate a repeat dose clinical study of a novel intravenous formulation of at at iv co administered with myozyme lumizyme in the third quarter of in addition  working with our contract manufacturer laureate pharmaceuticals  we have initiated development of a co formulated product which combines at duvoglustat hcl with our own proprietary recombinant human rh gaa enzyme as a next generation ert for pompe disease 
we believe this approach has the potential to improve the properties of the rhgaa enzyme itself while incorporating at as a small molecule stabilizer to increase exposure and tissue uptake  and reduce immunogenicity relative to currently marketed erts 
chart programs in other lsds we also plan to continue our commitment to the broader application of the chart technology as a potential next generation treatment approach for other lysosomal storage diseases in our preclinical studies include the pharmacological chaperones at and afegostat tartrate at co administered with ert for gaucher disease  and new undisclosed pharmacological chaperones in combination with other erts 
in addition  we continue our preclinical work to investigate at  which targets the glucocerobrosidase gcase enzyme in the brain  as a potential treatment for parkinson disease 
we have generated significant losses to date and expect to continue to generate losses as we continue the clinical and preclinical development of our drug candidates 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
from our inception in 
table of contents february through december   we have accumulated a deficit of million 
as we have not yet generated commercial sales revenue from any of our product candidates  our losses will continue and are likely to be substantial in the near term 
collaboration with gsk on july   the company entered into the expanded collaboration agreement with an affiliate of glaxosmithkline plc gsk pursuant to which the company and gsk will continue to develop and commercialize migalastat hcl  currently in phase development for the treatment of fabry disease 
the expanded collaboration agreement amends and replaces in its entirety the license and collaboration agreement entered into between the company and gsk on october  the original collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of migalastat hcl 
under the terms of the expanded collaboration agreement  the company and gsk will co develop all formulations of migalastat hcl for fabry disease  including the development of migalastat hcl co formulated with an investigational enzyme replacement therapy ert for fabry disease the co formulated product in collaboration with another gsk collaborator jcr pharmaceutical co  ltd 
the company will commercialize all migalastat hcl products for fabry disease in the united states while gsk will commercialize all such products in the rest of the world 
gsk is eligible to receive us regulatory approval milestones totaling million for migalastat hcl monotherapy and migalastat hcl for co administration with ert  and additional regulatory approval and product launch milestone payments totaling up to million within seven years following the launch of the co formulated product 
the company will also be responsible for certain pass through milestone payments and single digit royalties on the net us sales of the co formulated product that gsk must pay to a third party 
in addition  the company is no longer eligible to receive any milestones or royalties it would have been eligible to receive under the original collaboration agreement other than a million clinical development milestone achieved in the second quarter of and paid by gsk to amicus in the third quarter of the company and gsk will continue to jointly fund development costs for all formulations of migalastat hcl in accordance with agreed upon development plans pursuant to which the company and gsk will fund and of such costs  respectively  for the monotherapy and co administration development of migalastat hcl for the remainder of and will fund and  respectively  thereafter 
effective upon entry into the expanded collaboration agreement  costs for the development of the co formulated product are also split and between amicus and gsk  respectively 
additionally  simultaneous with entry into the expanded collaboration agreement  the company and gsk entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which gsk purchased approximately million shares of amicus common stock at a price of per share 
the total value of this equity investment to the company is approximately million and changes gsk ownership position in the company to 
gsk previously purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share for a total equity investment of approximately million in connection with entry into the original collaboration agreement 
other potential alliances and collaborations we continually evaluate other potential collaborations and business development opportunities that would bolster our ability to develop therapies for rare and orphan diseases including licensing agreements and acquisitions of businesses and assets 
we believe such opportunities may be important to the advancement of our current product candidate pipeline  the expansion of the development of our current technology  gaining access to new technologies and in our transformation from a development stage company to a commercial biotechnology company 

table of contents financial operations overview revenue under the original license and collaboration agreement  gsk paid us an initial  non refundable license fee of million and a premium of million related to gsk purchase of an equity investment in amicus which was being recognized as collaboration and milestone revenue on a straight line basis over the development period 
in addition  in june  we recognized a million payment for a clinical development milestone as collaboration and milestone revenue 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  as collaboration and milestone revenue 
the reimbursements for research and development costs under the original license and collaboration agreement that met the criteria for revenue recognition were recognized as research revenue 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  as research revenue 
on july   we entered into the expanded collaboration agreement with gsk 
due to a change in the accounting for revenue recognition for the expanded collaboration agreement  all revenue recognition will be suspended until the total arrangement consideration becomes fixed and determinable 
starting on july   any payments received from gsk are recorded as deferred reimbursements on the balance sheet 
in addition  future milestone payments we may pay gsk will be applied against the balance of this deferred reimbursements account 
revenue recognition would resume once the total arrangement consideration becomes fixed and determinable which would occur when the balance of the deferred reimbursements account is sufficient to cover all the remaining contingent milestone payments due to gsk 
as a result  we no longer recognize any revenue related to collaboration and milestone revenue or research revenue as of the date of the expanded collaboration agreement 
there is no cash effect of this change in accounting  and there is no scenario where amicus would have to refund any of the upfront payment  milestone payments  or research reimbursement payments 
research and development expenses we expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses as we continue to develop our product candidates and explore new uses for our pharmacological chaperone technology 
however  we will share future research and development costs related to migalastat hcl with gsk in accordance with the expanded collaboration agreement 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with our research and clinical development activities  payments we make to third party contract research organizations  contract manufacturers  investigative sites  and consultants  technology license costs  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in drug discovery and development  activities relating to regulatory filings and the advancement of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent  facility maintenance  as well as laboratory and other supplies 

table of contents we have multiple research and development projects ongoing at any one time 
we utilize our internal resources  employees and infrastructure across multiple projects 
we record and maintain information regarding external  out of pocket research and development expenses on a project specific basis 
we expense research and development costs as incurred  including payments made to date under our license agreements 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates 
from our inception in february through december   we have incurred research and development expense in the aggregate of million 
the following table summarizes our principal product development projects through december   including the related stages of development for each project  and the out of pocket  third party expenses incurred with respect to each project in thousands period from february  inception to december  years ended december  projects third party direct project expenses mono therapy studies migalastat hcl fabry disease phase afegostat tartrate gaucher disease phase at pompe disease phase combination studies migalastat hcl co administration fabry disease phase migalastat hcl co formulation fabry disease preclinical afegostat tartrate co administration gaucher disease preclinical at co administration pompe disease phase neurodegenerative diseases preclinical total third party direct project expenses other project costs personnel costs other costs total other project costs total research and development costs other project costs are leveraged across multiple projects 

table of contents other costs include facility  supply  overhead  and licensing costs that support multiple projects 
we do not plan to advance our afegostat tartrate monotherapy program into phase development at this time 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates 
as a result  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates  including migalastat hcl or any of our other preclinical product candidates 
this uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the conduct  duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of evolving events during clinical development  including the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patients  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the results of our clinical trials  and any mandate by the fda or other regulatory authority to conduct clinical trials beyond those currently anticipated 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
we may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others 
in addition  gsk has considerable influence over and decision making authority related to our migalastat hcl program 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of that product candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
drug development may take several years and millions of dollars in development costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs  including stock based compensation expense  for persons serving in our executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expense includes facility related costs not otherwise included in research  and development expense  promotional expenses  costs associated with industry and trade shows  and professional fees for legal services  including patent related expense and accounting services 
from our inception in february through december   we spent million on general and administrative expense 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on our capital lease facility and our equipment financing agreements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following discussion represents our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when amounts are realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is considered realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the amounts due are reasonably assured 
in multiple element arrangements  revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting and each deliverable in an arrangement is evaluated to determine whether it represents separate units of accounting 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and there is no general right of return for the delivered elements 
in instances when the aforementioned criteria are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and the allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition is determined for the combined unit as a single unit of accounting 
allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit relative selling price 
in instances where there is determined to be a single unit of accounting  the total consideration is applied as revenue for the single unit of accounting and is recognized over the period of inception through the date where the last deliverable within the single unit of accounting is expected to be delivered 
our current revenue recognition policies  which were applied in fiscal  provide that  when a collaboration arrangement contains multiple deliverables  such as license and research and development services  we allocate revenue to each separate unit of accounting based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on i its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  ii third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or iii best estimated selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we would establish the vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately 
the tpe of selling price would be established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
the besp would be established considering internal factors such as an internal pricing analysis or an income approach using a discounted cash flow model 
we also consider the impact of potential future payments we make in our role as a vendor to our customers and evaluate if these potential future payments could be a reduction of revenue from that customer 
if the potential future payments to the customer are a payment for an identifiable benefit  and the identifiable benefit is separable from the existing relationship between us and our customer  and the identifiable benefit can be obtained from a party other than the customer  and 
table of contents the fair value of the identifiable benefit can be reasonably estimated  then the payments are accounted for separately from the revenue received from that customer 
if  however  all these criteria are not satisfied  then the payments are treated as a reduction of revenue from that customer 
if we determine that any potential future payments to our customers are to be considered as a reduction of revenue  we must evaluate if the total amount of revenue to be received under the arrangement is fixed and determinable 
if the total amount of revenue is not fixed and determinable due to the uncertain nature of the potential future payments to the customer  then any customer payments cannot be recognized as revenue until the total arrangement consideration becomes fixed and determinable 
the reimbursements for research and development costs under collaboration agreements that meet the criteria for revenue recognition are included in research revenue and the costs associated with these reimbursable amounts are included in research and development expenses 
in order to determine the revenue recognition for contingent milestones  we evaluate the contingent milestones using the criteria as provided by the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition at the inception of a collaboration agreement 
the criteria requires that i we determine if the milestone is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value resulting from our activities to achieve the milestone  ii the milestone be related to past performance  and iii the milestone be reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms of the collaboration arrangement 
if these criteria are met then the contingent milestones can be considered as substantive milestones and will be recognized as revenue in the period that the milestone is achieved 
accrued expenses when we are required to estimate accrued expenses because we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost  we identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimate the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees owed to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees owed to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees owed to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  fees owed for professional services  and unpaid salaries  wages and benefits 
stock based compensation in accordance with the applicable guidance  we measure stock based compensation at a fair value which is determined by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of the award 
we chose the straight line attribution method for allocating compensation costs and recognized the fair value of each stock option on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related awards 

table of contents the following table summarizes the stock compensation expense recognized in the income statement in millions years ended december  stock compensation expense recognized in research and development expense general and administrative expense total stock compensation expense we use the black scholes option pricing model when estimating the value for stock based awards 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility was calculated based on a blended weighted average of historical information of our stock and the weighted average of historical information of similar public entities for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use a blended weighted average approach using our own historical volatility and other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life was determined using a simplified method of estimating the expected exercise term which is the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
as our stock price volatility has been over and we have experienced significant business transactions shire and gsk collaborations  we believe that we do not have sufficient reliable exercise data in order to justify a change from the use of the simplified method of estimating the expected exercise term of employee stock option grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury  zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures are estimated based on expected turnover as well as a historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows years ended december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options years expected annual dividend per share the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted during  and were  and  respectively 
warrants the warrants issued in connection with our march registered direct offering are classified as a liability 
the fair value of the warrant liability is evaluated at each balance sheet date using the black scholes valuation model 
this model uses inputs such as the underlying price of the shares issued when the warrant is exercised  volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life of the instrument 
any changes in the fair value of the warrants liability is recognized in the consolidated statement of 
table of contents operations 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes valuation model for the warrants for december  and are as follows december december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of warrants years expected annual dividend per share during there were approximately million warrants exercised and for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million due to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability 
the resulting fair value of the warrant liability at december  was million 
basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share we calculated net loss per share as a measurement of our performance while giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the reporting period 
we had a net loss for all periods presented  accordingly  the inclusion of common stock options and warrants would be anti dilutive 
therefore  the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted earnings per share are the same 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in computing basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share in thousands except share amounts years ended december  historical numerator net loss attributable to common stockholders denominator weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted dilutive common stock equivalents would include the dilutive effect of common stock options and warrants for common stock equivalents 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the diluted earnings per share denominator for all periods because of their anti dilutive effect 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  as collaboration and milestone revenue which includes a million payment for a clinical development milestone in the reimbursements for research and development costs under the original license and collaboration agreement that met the criteria for revenue recognition were recognized as research revenue 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  as research revenue 

table of contents under the original license and collaboration agreement  gsk paid us an initial  non refundable license fee of million and a premium of million related to gsk purchase of an equity investment in amicus which was being recognized as collaboration and milestone revenue on a straight line basis over the development period until entry into the expanded collaboration agreement 
due to a change in the accounting for revenue recognition for the expanded collaboration agreement  all revenue recognition related to the collaboration will be suspended until the total arrangement consideration becomes fixed and determinable 
any payments received from gsk will be recorded as deferred reimbursements on the balance sheet 
in addition  future milestone payments we may pay gsk will be applied against the balance of this deferred reimbursements account 
revenue recognition would resume once the total arrangement consideration becomes fixed and determinable which would occur when the balance of the deferred reimbursements account is sufficient to cover all the remaining contingent milestone payments 
as a result  we no longer recognize any revenue related to collaboration and milestone revenue or research revenue as of the date of the expanded collaboration agreement 
there is no cash effect of this change in accounting  and there is no scenario where amicus would have to refund any of the upfront payment  milestone payments  or research reimbursement payments 
we have not generated any commercial sales revenue since our inception 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in representing a decrease of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to a million decrease in contract manufacturing and a million decrease in contract research costs  partially offset by increases in personnel costs of million  license fees of million and million in consulting fees 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in  a decrease of million or from million in the variance was primarily due to a decrease in personnel cost of million which was related to two events in additional stock option compensation expense recognized as a result of the change in the terms of the chief executive officer stock options resulting from his resignation and subsequent reappointment to the chief executive officer position  and a severance related compensation charge of million related to the resignation of the former president and the vesting of his restricted stock award 
in addition  there were decreases in accounting services and recruitment fees for million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of million in legal fees  million in facility costs and million in consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  an increase of million or from million in the increase in depreciation was due to assets purchased in in connection with the new office and laboratory space in cranbury  new jersey 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in  an increase of million or from million in the increase in interest income was due to the overall higher average cash and investment balances  due to cash raised in our march stock the public offering 
interest expense was million for both and change in fair value of warrant liability 
in connection with the sale of our common stock and warrants from the registered direct offering in march  we recorded the warrants as a liability at their fair value using a black scholes model and remeasure the fair value at each reporting date until the warrants are exercised or expired 
changes in the fair value of the warrant liability are reported in the statements of operations as non operating income or expense 
during  there were approximately million warrants exercised 
for the year ended december   we reported a gain of million related to the decrease in fair value of the warrant liability from the year ended december  the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 

table of contents consequently  future fluctuations in the price of our common stock may cause significant increases or decreases in the fair value of the warrants liability 
other income expense 
other income for the year ended december  was thousand and represents cash received from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
other income for the year ended december  was thousand under the qualified therapeutic discovery projects tax credit and grant program 
tax benefit 
during and  we sold a portion of our new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits  which resulted in the recognition of million and million in income tax benefits for the years ended december  and  respectively 
should the state of new jersey continue to fund this program  which is uncertain  the future amount of net operating loss and research and development credit carry forwards which we may sell will depend upon the allocation among qualifying companies of an annual pool established by the state of new jersey 
net operating loss carry forwards 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  or nols  of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal carry forward will expire in through most of the state carry forwards generated prior to began to expire in and will continue to expire through the remaining state carry forwards including those generated from through will expire in through due to a change in the new jersey state law regarding the net operating loss carry forward period 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  contains provisions which limit the amount of nols that companies may utilize in any one year in the event of cumulative changes in ownership over a three year period in excess of 
during  there was no ownership change in excess of  therefore there was no write down to net realizable value of the federal nols subject to the limitations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  consisted of payments received from gsk for shared development costs for migalastat hcl research revenue and the recognized portion of the million upfront cash payment received from gsk collaboration revenue 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of the total upfront consideration as collaboration revenue  compared to million in the prior year and million of research revenue for reimbursed research and development costs in we did not recognize any research revenue in and we have not generated any commercial sales revenue since our inception 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in representing an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to a million increase in contract research related to clinical trials  a million increase in gsk collaboration fees  and higher personnel costs of million  partially offset by a million decrease in license fees and million decrease in manufacturing costs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily due to additional stock option compensation expense recognized of million as a result of the change in the terms of the chief executive officer stock options resulting from his resignation and subsequent reappointment to the chief executive officer position as well as a severance related compensation charge of million related to the resignation of our former president and the vesting of his restricted stock award 
in addition  there were increases in recruitment fees  professional fees  and consulting fees of million

we invest cash in excess of our immediate requirements with regard to liquidity and capital preservation in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies and money market accounts 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
although we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits  we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances

funding requirements we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future primarily due to research and development expenses  including expenses related to conducting clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials of our drug candidates  including migalastat hcl  the continuation of our collaboration with gsk and gsk achievement of milestone payments there under  the scope  progress  results and costs of preclinical development  laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates including those testing the use of pharmacological chaperones co formulated and co administered with ert and for the treatment of diseases of neurodegeneration  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  and 
table of contents our ability to establish collaborations and obtain milestone  royalty or other payments from any such collaborators 
we do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from commercial sales of our current product pipeline until at least  if at all 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several quarters and years 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to cover our cash flow requirements into the second half of financial uncertainties related to potential future payments milestone payments we have acquired rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates through licenses granted by various parties 
while our license agreements for migalastat hcl and at do not contain milestone payment obligations  two of these agreements related to afegostat tartrate do require us to make such payments if certain specified pre commercialization events occur 
upon the satisfaction of certain milestones and assuming successful development of afegostat tartrate  we may be obligated  under the agreements that we have in place  to make future milestone payments aggregating up to approximately million 
however  such potential milestone payments are subject to many uncertain variables that would cause such payments  if any  to vary in size 
under the expanded collaboration agreement  gsk is eligible to receive us regulatory approval milestones totaling million for migalastat hcl monotherapy and migalastat hcl ert co administration  and additional regulatory approval and product launch milestone payments totaling up to million within seven years following the launch of the co formulated product 
we will also be responsible for certain pass through milestone payments and single digit royalties on the net us sales of the co formulated product that gsk must pay to a third party 
in addition  we are no longer eligible to receive any milestones or royalties we would have been eligible to receive under the original collaboration agreement other than a million clinical development milestone achieved in the second quarter of and paid by gsk to us in the third quarter of royalties under our license agreements  if we owe royalties on net sales for one of our products to more than one licensor  then we have the right to reduce the royalties owed to one licensor for royalties paid to another 
the amount of royalties to be offset is generally limited in each license and can vary under each agreement 
for migalastat hcl and at  we will owe royalties only to mt 
sinai school of medicine mssm 
we would expect to pay royalties to all three licensors with respect to afegostat tartrate should we advance it to commercialization 
to date  we have not made any royalty payments on sales of our products and believe we are at least a couple years away from selling any products that would require us to make any such royalty payments 
in accordance with our license agreement with mssm  in the third quarter of  we paid million of the million milestone payment received from gsk to mssm 
in the fourth quarter of  we paid million of the million upfront payment received from gsk to mssm 
we will also be obligated to pay mssm royalties on worldwide net sales of migalastat hcl 
whether we will be obligated to make milestone or royalty payments in the future is subject to the success of our product development efforts and  accordingly  is inherently uncertain

these contractual obligations are not reflected in the table above because we may terminate them without penalty

to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb amended its guidance to require an entity to present the effect of certain significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income 
the new accounting guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december  and we will be required to adopt these new provisions no later than the quarter beginning january  as the guidance requires additional presentation only  there will be no impact to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the provisions of this guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  other than a change in presentation  the implementation of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb amended the fasb accounting standards codification to converge the fair value measurement guidance in us gaap and international financial reporting standards

the amendments are effective for fiscal year and should be applied prospectively 
the provisions of the amendments did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates  equity prices  creditworthiness  financing  exchange rates or other factors 
our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  corporate debt securities  asset backed securities and us government agency notes with maturities of less than one year  which we believe are subject to limited interest rate and credit risk 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and  due to the short term nature  are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure and consistent with our investment policy  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities and due to the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in average interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
as december   our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities were all due on demand or within one year 
our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate and therefore  we have no exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we have operated primarily in the us  although we do conduct some clinical activities with vendors outside the us while most expenses are paid in us dollars  there are minimal payments made in local foreign currency 
if exchange rates undergo a change of  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
