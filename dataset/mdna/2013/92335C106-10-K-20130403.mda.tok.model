net revenues net revenues reflect revenues from the sale of our merchandise and from distribution and shipping and handling fees  less returns and discounts 
revenues for the direct segment reflect sales through our full price and outlet stores  department store locations in japan  our websites  verabradley 
com and verabradley 
co 
jp  and our annual outlet sale in fort wayne  indiana 
revenues for the indirect segment reflect sales to indirect specialty retailers and department stores 
comparable store sales comparable store sales are calculated based upon our stores that have been open at least full fiscal months as of the end of the reporting period 
remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or comparable prior period or the remodel resulted in a significant change in square footage 
some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales differently than we do 
as a result  data in this report regarding our comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other companies 
non comparable store sales include sales from stores not included in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales do not include e commerce sales 
measuring the change in year over year comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our store base is performing 
various factors affect our comparable store sales  including overall economic trends  consumer preferences and fashion trends  competition  the timing of our releases of new patterns and collections  changes in our product mix  pricing  the level of customer service that we provide in stores  our ability to source and distribute products efficiently  the number of stores we open and close in any period  and the timing and success of promotional and advertising efforts 
gross profit gross profit is equal to our net revenues less our cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the direct cost of purchased and manufactured merchandise  distribution center costs  operations overhead  duty  and all inbound freight costs incurred 
the components of our reported cost of sales may not be comparable to those of other retail and wholesale companies

a portion of our advertising expenses may be reimbursed by indirect retailers  and such amount is classified as other income 
administrative expenses include employee compensation for corporate functions  corporate headquarters occupancy costs  consulting and software expenses  and charitable donations 
other income we support many of our indirect retailers marketing efforts by distributing certain catalogs and promotional mailers to current and prospective customers 
our indirect retailers reimburse us for a portion of the cost to produce these materials 
reimbursement received is recorded as other income 
the related cost to design  produce  and distribute the catalogs and mailers is recorded as sg a expense 
other income also includes proceeds from the sales of tickets to our annual outlet sale and the gain on the sale of certain life insurance policies 
operating income operating income equals gross profit less sg a expenses plus other income 
operating income excludes interest income  interest expense  and income taxes 
income taxes prior to october   we were taxed as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes under section of the internal revenue code  and therefore were not subject to federal and state income taxes subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that do not recognize the s corporation status 
on october   our s corporation status automatically terminated and we became subject to corporate level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates

the impact of these items on the effective tax rate was approximately for the fiscal year 
during fiscal  there were other permanent items that caused a higher rate which did not recur during fiscal causing the rate to decrease approximately compared to the prior year 
the effective tax rate also reflects a loss for the japanese operations for which a tax benefit was not recognized

the remaining million was attributable to lower average borrowing rates in the fiscal year ended january  income tax expense for fiscal  we recorded income tax expense of million at an effective tax rate of  which is consistent with us federal and state statutory rates 
the change in our effective tax rate from fiscal reflects a more normalized rate due to being subject to corporate level us federal and state income taxes for the full fiscal year 
the effective tax rate also reflects a loss for the japanese operations for which a tax benefit was not recognized 
for fiscal  we recorded income tax expense of million 
this expense was comprised of million of expense related to activity during the portion of fiscal that we were a c corporation october   through january  at an effective tax rate of and million of state taxes related to taxing jurisdictions that did not recognize our previous s corporation status  offset in part by a one time deferred tax benefit of million recognized upon the termination of our s corporation status 
included in tax expense 
table of contents for the portion of the fiscal year that we operated as a c corporation was million related to permanently non deductible stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards that vested in connection with our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources general our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations 
we also have access to additional liquidity  if needed  through borrowings under our million amended and restated credit agreement 
historically  our primary cash needs have been for merchandise inventories  payroll  store rent  capital expenditures associated with opening new stores  buildings  debt repayments  operational equipment  and information technology 
the most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  merchandise inventories  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and other current liabilities 
we do not believe that the expansion of our direct business will materially increase borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement  in the near term 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures  and debt payments for the foreseeable future 
cash flow analysis a summary of operating  investing  and financing activities is shown in the following table in thousands fiscal year ended february  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation  amortization  deferred taxes  and stock based compensation  the effect of changes in assets and liabilities  and tenant improvement allowances received from landlords under our store leases 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal net income increased million  non cash changes in balances increased million  and income taxes payable provided an incremental increase of million  offset by working capital changes including an incremental inventory build of million and an incremental reduction in accounts payable of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal which was primarily driven by our net income in the current year 
this is slightly down from million for the fiscal year ended january   primarily due to additional income tax payments of million in the current year because of the conversion from an s corporation to a c corporation in the prior year making us subject to corporate level us federal and state income taxes 
in addition  cash flow decreased due to timing of payments to our vendors  which was more than offset by the improvements in our supply chain and inventory management processes which allowed inventory levels to grow much less than in fiscal net cash used in investing activities investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings  buildings  operational equipment  and information technology investments 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the expansion of the distribution facility 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the million increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the investments in new stores  including the opening of stores during fiscal  expansion of the distribution facility  and information technology investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting capital expenditures of million offset in part by million of cash provided as a result of the elimination of a compensating balance requirement in connection with the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  including the build out of new stores and continued investment in our systems  including the e commerce platform 
net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  primarily resulting from million net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  resulting from the net payments under our amended and restated credit agreement 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  driven primarily by million of s corporation distributions including the final s corporation distribution of million and million of debt issuance costs  offset in part by ipo net proceeds of million and net borrowings of million under the credit agreement or amended and restated credit agreement 
amended and restated credit agreement on october   vera bradley designs  inc entered into an agreement to amend and restate our credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  as administrative agent  and certain other lenders 
the amended and restated credit agreement provides for a revolving credit commitment of million and matures on october  all borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement is also guaranteed by the company 
the credit agreement requires us to comply with various financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to and a leverage ratio of not more than to 
the agreement also contains various other covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness  liens  investments  acquisitions  and asset sales 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of february  borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus the applicable margin ranging from to or the alternate base rate as defined in the agreement plus the applicable margin ranging from to 
the applicable margin is tied to our leverage ratio 
in addition  we are required to pay a quarterly facility fee as defined in the agreement ranging from to of the revolving credit commitment 
at february   the weighted average interest rate on the million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement was 
we had borrowing availability of million under the agreement as of february  on june   vera bradley designs  inc entered into an amendment to the credit agreement 
the amendment extends the maturity date from october  to june  certain permitted indebtedness covenants were also amended 

table of contents contractual obligations we enter into long term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  primarily debt obligations and non cancellable operating leases 
as of february   our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years debt to financial institutions debt to others operating leases purchase obligations total as of february   we had million principal amount due on june  under our amended and restated credit agreement 
estimated total interest and facility fee payments of million  due through june   based on our outstanding borrowings and the interest rates in effect under our amended and restated credit agreement as of february   have been excluded 
we have entered into financing agreements with certain vendors 
the amounts listed represent the outstanding balances under these agreements 
our store leases generally have initial lease terms of years without renewal options 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to extend these leases  or if we were to enter into new operating leases 
purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchase 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our uncertain tax positions at february   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as the disclosures relating to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our accounting policies  estimates  and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we evaluate the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and believe that the following policies and estimates involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position  and are therefore discussed as critical 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to critical accounting policies  even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent results of operations 
our historical results for the periods presented in the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements  however  have not been materially impacted by such variances 
more information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of our products is recognized upon customer receipt of the product when collection of the associated receivables is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which  for e commerce and most indirect sales  reflects an estimate of shipments that customers have not yet received 
the adjustment of these shipments is based on actual delivery dates to the customer 
significant changes in shipping terms or delivery times could materially impact our revenues in a given period 
we reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
in the direct business returns are refunded by issuing the same payment tender of the original purchase and in the indirect business the customer is issued a credit to its account to apply to outstanding invoices 
merchandise exchanges of the same product at the same price are not considered merchandise returns 
product returns are often resalable through our annual outlet sale or other channels 
additionally  we reserve for other potential product credits and for customer shipments not yet received 
the total reserve for returns  customer shipments not yet received  and general credits was million and million at february   and january   respectively 
this represents a reduction to operating income of million and million  respectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
market is determined based on net realizable value  which includes costs to dispose 
appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence  excess quantities  and other factors  including the popularity of a pattern or product  in evaluating net realizable value 
we record valuation adjustments to our inventories  which are reflected in cost of sales  if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory 
this adjustment calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates  which are based on factors such as merchandise seasonality  historical trends  and estimated sales and inventory levels  including sell through of remaining units 
in addition  as part of inventory adjustments  we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from our physical inventory counts 
we perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly 
inventory adjustments of million and million were recorded for these matters during the fiscal year ended february   and january   respectively 
these adjustments related primarily to raw materials of retired patterns  as we have the ability to move retired finished goods through a number of channels  including the annual outlet sale  our website and outlet stores  and through liquidators as needed 
income taxes prior to october   we were taxed as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes under section of the internal revenue code  and therefore were not subject to federal and state income taxes subject to exception in a limited number of state and local jurisdictions that do not recognize the s corporation status 
on october   our s corporation status automatically terminated and we became subject to corporate level federal and state income taxes at prevailing corporate rates 
our effective tax rate is based on our pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax laws and regulations  and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain 
table of contents based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  or the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable 
taxing authorities  however  may take a contrary position 
our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  we prevail in positions for which we have established reserves  or are required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
valuation of long lived assets property  plant  and equipment assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset at the store level  the lowest identifiable level of cash flow  if applicable 
if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value  usually determined by an estimated discounted cash flow analysis of the asset 
factors used in the valuation of long lived assets include  but are not limited to  our plans for future operations  brand initiatives  recent operating results  and projected future cash flows 
with respect to our stores  we analyze store economics  location within the shopping center  the size and shape of the space  and desirable co tenancies in our selection process 
impairment charges are classified in sg a expenses 
the discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates 
the estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include estimated future cash flow generated at the store level  and discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values 
these and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and our expectations and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
if economic conditions were to deteriorate  future impairment charges may be required 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  the company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in accordance with this guidance  we have presented two separate but consecutive statements which include the components of net income and other comprehensive income 
in may  fasb issued asu  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the guidance requires additional disclosures  including disclosures related to the measurement of level assets 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
transactions with related parties see item  certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence  of this report for information regarding transactions with related parties 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement  which bear interest at variable rates 
the amended and restated credit agreement allows for a revolving credit commitment of million  bearing interest at a variable rate  based on either libor plus the applicable margin ranging from to or the alternate base rate as defined in the agreement plus the applicable margin ranging from to 
assuming the amended and restated credit agreement is fully drawn  each quarter point increase or decrease in the interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately million 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk 
we had no open derivative instruments at february  impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost 
although it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  we believe the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial 
foreign exchange rate risk we source a substantial majority of our materials from various suppliers in china and south korea 
substantially all purchases and sales involving foreign persons are denominated in us dollars  and therefore we do not hedge using any derivative instruments 
historically  we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates
