overview update on impact of natural disasters two strong hurricanes struck portions of whitney s service area in the late summer of the following sections summarize some the more significant continuing financial repercussions of these natural disasters for the company and the bank 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses relationship officers have closely monitored the performance of storm impacted loan customers 
information provided by these officers and statistics on the performance of consumer credits were factored into management s determination of the allowance for loan losses at december  the significant overall uncertainties that complicated management s early assessments of storm related credit losses have largely been addressed in the year since the storms  and the storms impact on credit quality is primarily being reflected in the normal process for determining the loan loss allowance and reserves for losses on unfunded credit commitments 
some important uncertainties remain  however  including those specific to some individual customers  such as the resolution of insurance claims  and those applicable to the economic prospects of the storm impacted area as a whole 
management will continue to monitor the resolution of these uncertainties when determining future loss allowances and reserves 
disaster response costs  casualty losses  business interruption and related insurance the bank incurred a variety of costs to operate in disaster response mode  and a number of facilities and their contents were damaged by the storms  including sixteen that required replacement  relocation or major renovation 
whitney maintains insurance for casualty losses as well as for reasonable and necessary disaster response costs and certain revenue lost through business interruption 
all significant disaster response costs have been incurred and included where appropriate in an insurance claim receivable based on management s understanding of the underlying coverage 
the bulk of costs to replace or renovate facilities will be incurred in future periods  and these will be included in the insurance claims as appropriate 
management projects that casualty claims arising from the storms will be within policy limits  and that gains will be recognized with respect to these claims in future periods  however  this is contingent upon reaching agreement with insurance carriers 
highlights of financial results whitney earned million for the year ended december   compared with annual net income of million in per share earnings were per basic share and per diluted share in  compared to and  respectively  for the bank saw a rapid build up of deposits following the later summer hurricanes of that impacted parts of whitney s market area  and the funds retained from these deposits during were a major factor behind the significant growth in average earning assets and net interest income compared to annual average deposits in were up  or billion  from the results for also included approximately million in expenses associated with the storms 
this total included both the cost to implement initiatives that reduced the exposure of the company s operations to future disasters and improved operational resilience as well as certain increased operating costs and additional expenditures directly related to the storms 
the components of these expenses are covered in more detail in the noninterest expense section of the discussion of results of operations below 
approximately million of storm related expenses were recognized in management s initial assessment of the storms impact on credit quality was the main factor in the million annual provision for credit losses in in april  whitney acquired first national bancshares  inc of bradenton  florida first national and its subsidiary  st national bank trust st national  which operated in the tampa bay area 
st national had approximately million in total assets  including a loan portfolio valued at million  and million in deposits at the acquisition date 
first national shareholders received million shares of whitney common stock and cash totaling million  for a total transaction value of approximately million 
the company merged st national into the bank in july whitney s financial information for includes the results from these acquired operations since the acquisition date 
the key components of s earnings performance follow net interest income  on a taxable equivalent te basis  increased  or million  in average earning assets were higher in  and the net interest margin te widened by basis points 
the most important factors behind the increase in net interest income in were earning asset growth  supported in part by funds retained from the post storm deposit build up  higher short term market interest rates  the favorable impact on the funding mix of post storm liquidity in the deposit base  and active management of the pricing structure for both loans and deposits 
whitney provided million for credit losses in  compared to a million provision in that incorporated management s early estimate of the impact of the storms 
net charge offs totaled million in  including one million storm impacted credit  compared to million in during  there was a million decrease in the total of loans criticized through the internal credit risk classification process 
noninterest income increased  or million  between and improvements were noted in a number of income categories  reflecting both internal growth and contributions from acquired operations 
deposit service charge income was down compared to the residual additional liquidity in the deposit base from the post storm build up continued to reduce comparative charging opportunities in  and fee potential from business customers declined as the earnings credit allowed against account charges rose between the years with short term market rates 
noninterest expense increased  or million  from as noted above  included approximately million in expenses associated directly and indirectly with the late summer hurricanes of  compared to million in incremental operating costs associated with acquired operations  including amortization of intangibles  totaled approximately million in whitney s personnel expense increased  or million  in total  including approximately million related to acquired staff 
compensation expense under management incentive programs increased by million in of  almost all related to share based compensation earned under whitney s long term incentive plan 
critical accounting policies whitney prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a discussion of certain accounting principles and methods of applying those principles that are particularly important to this process is included in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item in applying these principles to determine the amounts and other disclosures that are presented in the financial statements and discussed in this section  the company is required to make estimates and assumptions 
whitney believes that the determination of its estimate of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its application of other significant accounting policies 
factors considered in this determination and management s process are discussed in note and in the following section on loans  credit risk management and allowance and reserve for credit losses 
although management believes it has identified appropriate factors for review and designed and implemented adequate procedures to support the estimation process that are consistently followed  the allowance remains an estimate about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
over time  changes in economic conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of whitney s credit customers or other factors can materially impact the allowance estimate  potentially subjecting the company to significant earnings volatility 
management makes a variety of assumptions in applying principles that govern the accounting for benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
these assumptions are essential to the actuarial valuation that determines the amounts whitney recognizes and certain disclosures it makes in the consolidated financial statements related to the operation of these plans see note in item 
two of the more significant assumptions concern the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate needed to discount projected benefits to their present value 
changes in these assumptions impact the cost of retirement benefits recognized in net income and comprehensive income 
certain assumptions are closely tied to current conditions and are generally revised at each measurement date 
for example  the discount rate is reset annually with reference to market yields on high quality fixed income investments 
other assumptions  such as the rate of return on assets  are determined  in part  with reference to historical and expected conditions over time and are not as susceptible to frequent revision 
holding other factors constant  the cost of retirement benefits will move opposite to changes in either the discount rate or the rate of return on assets 
recent trends in the cost of retirement benefits are discussed in the section on noninterest expense 
financial condition loans  credit risk management and allowance and reserve for credit losses loan portfolio developments total loans increased  or million  during whitney acquired a million loan portfolio with st national in april table shows loan balances by type of loan at december  and at the end of the previous four years 
the following discussion provides an overview of the composition of the different portfolio segments and the customers served in each as well as recent changes 
table loans outstanding by type december  in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial  construction and other real estate residential mortgage individuals total loans the portfolio of commercial loans  other than those secured by real property  increased  or million  between year end and advances on existing credits and a steady pace of newly originated loans in certain parts of whitney s market area during were largely offset by paydowns and payoffs  partly reflecting strong cash flows to customers in certain industry segments such as oil and gas and construction contractors as well as the application of storm related insurance proceeds 
the st national acquisition had little impact on this portfolio segment 
overall the portfolio has remained diversified  with customers in a range of industries  including oil and gas exploration and production  marine transportation and maritime construction  wholesale and retail trade in various durable and nondurable products and the manufacture of such products  financial services  and professional services 
also included in the commercial loan category are loans to individuals  generally secured by collateral other than real estate  that are used to fund investments in new or expanded business opportunities 
there have been no major trends or changes in the concentration mix of this portfolio segment from year end loans outstanding to oil and gas industry customers represented approximately of total loans at december   consistent with the percentage at year end the major portion of whitney s customer base in this industry provides transportation and other services and products to support exploration and production activities 
the bank seeks service and supply customers who are quality operators that can manage through volatile commodity price cycles 
with expectations of sustained higher commodity prices  whitney has increased its attention to lending opportunities in the exploration and production sector in recent years 
outstanding loans to exploration and production companies totaled a little more than one third of the industry portfolio at the end of  up slightly from year end the bank has a petroleum engineer on staff who participates in the underwriting of loans to exploration and production customers 
management  through the bank s credit policy committee  monitors both industry fundamentals and portfolio performance and credit quality on a formal ongoing basis and establishes and adjusts internal exposure guidelines as a percent of capital both for the industry as a whole and for individual sectors within the industry 
the level of activity in this industry continues to have an important impact on the economies of certain portions of whitney s market area  particularly houston and southern louisiana 
outstanding balances under participations in larger shared credit loan commitments totaled million at the end of  including approximately million related to the oil and gas industry 
the total outstanding is up million from year end substantially all such shared credits are with customers operating in whitney s market area 
the commercial real estate portfolio includes loans for construction and real estate development  both commercial and residential  loans secured by multi family residential properties and other income producing properties  and loans secured by properties used in commercial or industrial operations 
this portfolio sector grew  or million  during the st national acquisition added approximately million to this category in  mainly related to commercial mortgages 
whitney continues to develop new business in this highly competitive sector throughout its market area in addition to financing new projects for its established customer base 
the more recent activity in this portfolio sector has been driven by condominium and apartment projects and single family residential development  particularly in the eastern gulf coast region  and by the development of retail  office and industrial properties by customers throughout whitney s market area 
for several years  there has been little new financing activity for hotel and other hospitality industry projects  which has largely been concentrated in the new orleans metropolitan area 
the future pace of new real estate project financing will reflect the level of confidence by whitney and its customers in the sustainability of economic conditions favorable to successful project completion 
the rate of portfolio growth in a given period will also be affected by the refinancing of seasoned income properties in the secondary market and payments on residential development loans as inventory is sold 
the bank s credit policy committee has also set exposure guidelines for the overall portfolio of commercial real estate loans as well as for loans to developers or owner users that are secured by various subcategories of property 
as with lending to the oil and gas industry  management regularly monitors real estate industry fundamentals and portfolio credit quality 
the residential mortgage loan portfolio increased  or million  from the end of to year end this growth came mostly from acquisitions  with support from the continued promotion of targeted home loan products held in the portfolio 
whitney continues to sell most conventional residential mortgage loan production in the secondary market 
loans to individuals include various consumer installment and credit line products 
some storm related factors are evident in the decrease in this portfolio category since the end of  including the application of insurance proceeds and some reduction in credit demand associated with the ongoing disruption of normal routines for individuals from the most affected areas

written credit policies define underwriting criteria  concentration guidelines  and lending approval processes that cover individual authority and the appropriate involvement of regional loan committees and a senior loan committee 
the senior loan committee is composed of the bank s senior lenders  senior officers in credit administration  the president and the chairman and chief executive officer 
commercial credits  including commercial real estate loans  are underwritten principally based upon cash flow coverage  but additional support is regularly obtained through collateralization and guarantees 
commercial loans are typically relationship based rather than transaction driven 
loan concentrations are monitored monthly by management and the board of directors 
consumer loans are centrally underwritten with reference to the customer s debt capacity and with the support of automated credit scoring tools  including appropriate secondary review procedures 
a strong monitoring process is the key to early identification of problem credits 
lending officers are responsible for ongoing monitoring and the assignment of risk ratings to individual loans based on established guidelines 
an independent credit review function reporting to the audit committee of the board of directors assesses the accuracy of officer ratings and the timeliness of rating changes and performs concurrent reviews of the underwriting processes 
once a problem relationship over a certain size threshold is identified  a quarterly watch committee process is initiated 
the watch committee  composed of senior lending and credit administration management  must approve any substantive changes to identified problem credits and will assign relationships to a special credits department when appropriate 
management s evaluation of credit risk in the loan portfolio is reflected in the estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio that is reported in the company s financial statements as the allowance for loan losses 
changes in this evaluation over time are reflected in the provision for credit losses charged to expense 
the methodology for determining the allowance involves significant judgment  and important factors that influence this judgment are re evaluated quarterly to respond to changing conditions 
the recorded allowance encompasses three elements allowances established for losses on criticized loans  allowances based on historical loss experience for loans with acceptable credit quality and groups of homogeneous loans not individually rated  and allowances based on general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors internal and external to the company 
criticized loans are credits with above average weaknesses as identified through the internal risk rating process 
criticized loans include those that are deemed to be impaired as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
specific allowances are determined for impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual interest rate  the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  or  when available  the loan s observable market price 
the allowance for the remainder of criticized loans is calculated by applying loss factors to loan balances aggregated by the severity of the internal risk rating 
the loss factors applied to criticized loans are determined with reference to the results of migration analysis  which analyzes the charge off experience over time for loans within each rating category 
for the second element of the allowance  loans assessed as having average or better credit quality with similar risk ratings and homogeneous loans not subject to individual rating  such as residential mortgage loans  consumer installment loans and draws under consumer credit lines  are grouped together and individual loss factors are applied to each group 
the loss factors for homogeneous loan groups are based on average historical charge off information 
industry based factors are applied to other portfolio segments for which migration analysis has not been implemented 
determining the final element of the allowance involves assessing how other current factors  both internal and external  impact the accuracy of results obtained for the other two elements 
internally  management must consider whether trends have been identified in the quality of underwriting and loan administration as well as in the timely identification of credit quality issues 
management also monitors shifts in portfolio concentrations and other changes in portfolio characteristics that indicate levels of risk not fully captured in the loss factors 
external factors include local and national economic trends  as well as changes in the economic fundamentals of specific industries that are well represented in whitney s customer base 
management has established procedures to help ensure a consistent approach to this inherently judgmental process over time 
the monitoring of credit risk also extends to unfunded credit commitments  such as unused commercial credit lines and letters of credit  and management establishes reserves as needed for its estimate of probable losses on such commitments 
management s assessment of storms impact on credit quality and related uncertainties the significant overall uncertainties that complicated management s early assessments of storm related credit losses have largely been addressed by the end of  and the storms impact on credit quality is primarily being reflected in the normal process for managing credit risk and determining the loan loss allowance and reserve for losses on unfunded credit commitments 
loan officers completed individual assessments of the impact of the storms on all significant commercial and commercial real estate loan customers in the affected areas and initiated risk rating changes as needed  with confirmation of the conclusions by the credit review function 
whitney s commercial relationships include many larger corporate borrowers with significant resources who serve multiple market areas  have the ability to shift physical operations and are backed by strong guarantors 
the loan officers reviews generally confirmed management s expectation that most of these customers would show limited immediate or near term adverse effects from the storms  although one larger commercial credit with a manufacturer that was promptly identified as nonperforming has subsequently been charged off  as noted below 
another larger credit in heavy industry whose risk rating was initially downgraded in the storm impact review process has been subsequently removed from the criticized classifications 
tourism is an important facet of the new orleans economy  and the city s success in fully revitalizing this industry and hosting conventions is important to hotel operators and others in the hospitality industry over the long term 
the bank is closely tracking the operations of hospitality industry customers  and this process has generally confirmed the underlying financial and managerial strength within this customer base 
the rating on one hotel that encountered delays in reopening and was initially identified as warranting special attention was further downgraded during  and several other smaller tourism dependent credits have been criticized 
the detailed review process that was applied to commercial and commercial real estate loans following the storms was not logistically feasible for the residential mortgage and consumer credit components of the storm impacted portfolio  and payment deferral programs impaired the usefulness of statistics traditionally used to monitor credit quality in these portfolios 
initially  management segmented these portfolios using pre storm risk characteristics  and then assumed different levels of storm related credit deterioration for the various segments and applied incremental loss factors 
over time  these factors have been adjusted to reflect the accumulated statistics on actual loss experience 
credit quality statistics and components of credit loss allowance and reserve table provides information on nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets for each of the five years in the period ended december  nonperforming loans are included in the criticized loan total discussed below and encompass substantially all loans separately evaluated for impairment 
the million charge off of one storm impacted commercial relationship during is reflected in the reduction in nonperforming loans from year end this relationship had been identified as impaired shortly after the storms in  and a substantial impairment allowance had been established 
this charge off was a major factor behind a million decrease in the allowance for impaired loans during overall  there have been no significant trends related to industries or markets underlying the changes in nonperforming assets 
a comparison of contractual interest income on nonperforming loans with the cash basis and cost recovery interest actually recognized on these loans for  and is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item whitney s policy for placing loans on nonaccrual status is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
table nonperforming assets december dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis restructured loans total nonperforming loans foreclosed assets and surplus banking property total nonperforming assets loans days past due still accruing ratios nonperforming assets to loans plus foreclosed assets and surplus property allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans loans days past due still accruing to loans during  there was a million decrease in the total of loans criticized through the internal credit risk classification process 
criticized loans at december  included million of loans whose full repayment is in doubt 
with the million storm related charge off discussed above  the total for this rating classification decreased approximately million from the end of loans identified as having well defined weaknesses that would likely result in some loss if not corrected increased million during  to a total of million at year end 
the main contributor to this increase was the addition of storm impacted credits  most of which had been identified as warranting special attention by the end of several of these storm related downgrades were for customers directly impacted by the lingering slowdown in tourism 
rating movement on storm impacted credits  both the downgrades just mentioned and upgrades of other credits out of criticized categories  was also the main factor behind a million decrease in the total of loans warranting special attention since the end of the total for this rating category at year end was million 
the allowance determined for criticized loans at december   other than those separately evaluated for impairment  was up 
million from year end the overall allowance determined as of december  was million less than the allowance at year end the main factors behind this decrease were the net reduction of million in the allowance component associated with criticized loans and adjustments during to the special storm related component of the allowance that reflected sustained  better than anticipated performance by consumer credits and other loans from storm affected areas that are not subjected to individual credit reviews 
the allowance for loans with average or better credit quality ratings and loans not subject to individual rating increased million from the end of to december   mainly driven by loan growth 
management s relative assessment of economic and other qualitative risk factors between these dates added million to the allowance

the allocation of the allowance to loan categories is included in table  together with the percentage of total loans in each category

substantially all the unrealized losses at december  resulted from increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased 
management identified no value impairment related to credit quality in the portfolio 
in addition  management has the intent and ability to hold these securities until the market based impairment is recovered  therefore  no value impairment was evaluated as other than temporary

deposits and borrowings deposits at december  were  or million  below the level at year end this followed an increase of  or billion  from year end to the end of  which mainly reflected the rapid accumulation of deposits in the months following the storms 
much of this surge in deposits was sustained through the first half of  with anticipated reductions becoming evident mainly over the second half of the year as the recovery process progressed  inflows from insurance proceeds diminished and initial disaster assistance programs were completed

total borrowings from customers under repurchase agreements increased approximately  or million  from year end to the end of  and were up a comparable percentage on average in  partly reflecting generally strong liquidity in certain segments of the commercial deposit base 
because of the underlying customer relationship  these borrowings serve as a relatively stable source of funds 
additional information on borrowings  including yields and maximum amounts borrowed  is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements located in item shareholders equity and capital adequacy shareholders equity totaled billion at december   which represented an increase of million from the end of whitney issued million shares in the acquisition of first national bancshares  inc in april that were valued at million

liquidity management and contractual obligations liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available to meet cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the operating  capital and strategic cash flow needs of the company and the bank 
whitney develops its liquidity management strategies and measures and monitors liquidity risk as part of its overall asset liability management process  making full use of quantitative modeling tools available to project cash flows under a variety of possible scenarios 
projections are also made assuming credit stressed conditions  although such conditions are not currently anticipated 
liquidity management on the asset side primarily addresses the composition and maturity structure of the loan portfolio and the portfolio of investment securities and their impact on the company s ability to generate cash flows from scheduled payments  contractual maturities  and prepayments  through use as collateral for borrowings  and through possible sale or securitization 
table above presents the contractual maturity structure of the loan portfolio and table presents contractual investment maturities 
on the liability side  liquidity management focuses on growing the base of core deposits at competitive rates  including the use of treasury management products for commercial customers  while at the same time ensuring access to economical wholesale funding sources 
the earlier overview section and the section above on deposits and borrowings discuss changes in these liability funding sources in whitney national bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system 
this membership provides access to a variety of fhlb advance products as an alternative source of funds 
in addition  both the company and the bank have access to external funding sources in the financial markets  and the bank has developed the ability to gather deposits at a nationwide level  although it has not used this ability to date 
as noted earlier  the bank experienced a rapid accumulation of deposits in the months following the storms in whitney initially invested a significant portion of the accumulated funds in short term liquidity management securities and has since reduced these investments to satisfy an anticipated reduction in these deposits during as the recovery process continues 
although significant additional government funds to support the rebuilding process are becoming available in the storm impacted markets  only limited distributions had been made by the end of the extent to which these funds will impact whitney s deposit base and its liquidity position is uncertain  as is the timing of any such impact 
cash generated from operations is another important source of funds to meet liquidity needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows located in item present operating cash flows and summarize all significant sources and uses of funds for each year in the three year period ended december  at december   whitney holding corporation had approximately million in cash and demand notes from the bank available to provide liquidity for acquisitions  dividend payments to shareholders  stock repurchases or other corporate uses  before consideration of any future dividends that may be received from the bank 
during  the bank will have available an amount equal to approximately million plus its current net income to declare as dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval 
whitney has announced an agreement to acquire signature financial holdings  inc for cash and or stock in a transaction expected to close in the first quarter of the cash component of the purchase price will be no more that of approximately million in total consideration to be received by signature shareholders 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due from the company and the bank under specified long term and certain other contractual obligations as of december  obligations under deposit contracts and short term borrowings are not included 
the maturities of time deposits are scheduled in table above in the section on deposits and borrowings 
purchase obligations represent legal and binding contracts to purchase services or goods that cannot be settled or terminated without paying substantially all of the contractual amounts 
not included are a number of contracts entered into to support ongoing operations that either do not specify fixed or minimum amounts of goods or services or are cancelable on short notice without cause and without significant penalty 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide a picture of whitney s ability to fund these and other more significant cash operating expenses  such as interest expense and compensation and benefits  out of current operating cash flows 
table contractual obligations payments due by period from december  less than more than in thousands total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations subordinated debentures a other long term liabilities b c total a subordinated debentures are included with short term and other borrowings in the company s consolidated financial statements 
contractual payments are scheduled by expected call dates 
b obligations under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are not included 
the company does not anticipate making a pension contribution during  and does not anticipate any significant near term payments under the unfunded nonqualified pension plan 
a million nonqualified plan obligation was recorded at year end c the recorded obligation for postretirement benefits other than pensions was million at december  the funding to purchase benefits for current retirees  net of retiree contributions  has not been significant 
off balance sheet arrangements as a normal part of its business  the company enters into arrangements that create financial obligations that are not recognized  wholly or in part  in the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these arrangements  such as noncancelable operating leases  are reflected in table above 
the most significant off balance sheet obligations are the bank s commitments under traditional credit related financial instruments 
table schedules these commitments as of december  by the periods in which they expire 
commitments under credit card and personal credit lines generally have no stated maturity 
table credit related commitments in thousands commitments expiring by period from december  less than more than total year years years years loan commitments revolving loan commitments nonrevolving credit card and personal credit lines standby and other letters of credit total revolving loan commitments are issued primarily to support commercial activities 
the availability of funds under revolving loan commitments generally depends on whether the borrower continues to meet credit standards established in the underlying contract and has not violated other contractual conditions 
a number of such commitments are used only partially or  in some cases  not at all before they expire 
credit card and personal credit lines are generally subject to cancellation if the borrower s credit quality deteriorates  and many lines remain partly or wholly unused 
unfunded balances on revolving loan commitments and credit lines should not be used to project actual future liquidity requirements 
nonrevolving loan commitments are issued mainly to provide financing for the acquisition and development or construction of real property  both commercial and residential  although many are not expected to lead to permanent financing by the bank 
expectations about the level of draws under all credit related commitments are incorporated into the company s liquidity and asset liability management models 
substantially all of the letters of credit are standby agreements that obligate the bank to fulfill a customer s financial commitments to a third party if the customer is unable to perform 
the bank issues standby letters of credit primarily to provide credit enhancement to its customers other commercial or public financing arrangements and to help them demonstrate financial capacity to vendors 
the bank has historically had minimal calls to perform under standby agreements 
asset liability management the objective of the company s asset liability management is to implement strategies for the funding and deployment of its financial resources that are expected to maximize soundness and profitability over time at acceptable levels of risk 
interest rate sensitivity is the potential impact of changing rate environments on both net interest income and cash flows 
the company has developed a model to measure its interest rate sensitivity over the near term by running net interest income simulations and monitors longer term interest rate risk by modeling the sensitivity of its economic value of equity 
the model can be used to test the company s sensitivity in various economic environments 
the model incorporates management s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates 
assumptions can also be entered into the model to evaluate the impact of possible strategic responses to changes in the competitive environment 
management  through the company s asset liability committee  monitors simulation results against rate sensitivity guidelines specified in whitney s asset liability management policy 
the net interest income simulations run at the end of indicated that whitney was moderately asset sensitive over the near term  similar to its position at year end based on these simulations  annual net interest income te would be expected to increase million  or  and decrease million  or  if interest rates instantaneously increased or decreased  respectively  from current rates by basis points 
these changes are measured against the results of a base simulation run that uses growth forecasts as of the measurement date and that assumes a stable rate environment and structure 
the comparable simulation run at year end produced results that ranged from a positive impact on net interest income te of million  or  to a negative impact of million  or the actual impact that changes in interest rates have on net interest income will depend on many factors 
these factors include whitney s ability to achieve expected growth in earning assets and maintain a desired mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the actual timing when assets and liabilities reprice  the magnitude of interest rate changes and corresponding movement in interest rate spreads  and the level of success of asset liability management strategies that are implemented 
changes in interest rates affect the fair values of financial instruments 
the earlier section on investment securities and notes and to the consolidated financial statements located in item contain information regarding fair values 
the bank has used interest rate swaps on a limited basis to bring the market risk associated with the longer duration fixed rate loans desired by some customers in line with whitney s asset liability management objectives 
no interest rate swap agreements were in effect at december   and swap activity has had minimal impact on financial condition and results of operations 
other than this swap activity  the company has made no investments in financial instruments or participated in agreements with values that are linked to or derived from changes in the value of some underlying asset or index 
these are commonly referred to as derivatives and include such instruments as futures  forward contracts  option contracts  and other financial arrangements with similar characteristics 
management continues to evaluate whether to make additional use of derivatives as part of its asset liability and liquidity management processes 
results of operations net interest income te whitney s net interest income te increased million  or  in compared to average earning assets were  or billion  higher in and the net interest margin te improved basis points to from the net interest margin is net interest income te as a percent of average earning assets 
the most important factors behind the increase in net interest income in were earning asset growth  supported in part by the funds retained from the post storm deposit build up  higher short term market interest rates  the favorable impact on the funding mix of post storm liquidity in the deposit base  and active management of the pricing structure for both loans and deposits 
tables and provide details on the components of the company s net interest income te and net interest margin te 
a portion of the increase in average earning assets in reflected the significant influx of deposit funds that followed the late summer hurricanes in these funds were mainly deployed in short term investments that were on average million higher in compared to average loans  which in table include loans held for sale  increased  or million  in compared to  with approximately associated with the st national acquisition in april the overall yield on earning assets increased basis points to in  despite the higher percentage of lower yielding short term investments in the earning asset mix compared to liquidity management investments increased to of average earning assets in as compared to in  while loans comprised of earning assets in  down from in the main factor behind the overall yield improvement was the rise in benchmark rates for the large variable rate segment of whitney s loan portfolio 
loan yields te for were up basis points compared to short term rates began to increase in mid prompting an increase in bank prime rates totaling basis points by the end of  another basis points by year end  and a further increase of basis points through s year end 
balances of loans with adjustable rates tied to short term market rate indices or prime totaled nearly of the dollar value of the portfolio at the end of both and the yield te on the largely fixed rate investment portfolio is less responsive to changes in market rates and improved basis points between and the growth in earning assets in was funded primarily by an increase in average deposits of  or billion  compared to the funds retained during from the post storm deposit build up contributed to a favorable shift in the overall funding mix compared to and supported whitney s efforts to control the upward market pressure on funding rates through deposit pricing management 
the percentage of earning assets funded by noninterest bearing deposits was in  up from in  and the percentage of funding from all noninterest bearing sources increased to in from in the prior year 
higher cost sources of funds  which include time deposits and short term and other borrowings  declined to of average earning assets in from in  while funding from lower cost interest bearing deposits was stable at of earning assets in each period 
the overall cost of funds for was up basis points from the rate on lower cost interest bearing deposits increased basis points in compared to rates paid on higher cost sources of funds are more sensitive to market rate changes  reflecting in part the cost of attracting public funds and excess liquidity from certain corporate and private banking customers as noted earlier in the section on deposits and borrowings 
the rate on higher cost funding sources in was up basis points compared to changes in the mix of funding sources have a significant impact on the direction of the overall cost of funds 
whitney s ability to maintain a favorable mix and cost of funding sources over the longer term will depend on  among other factors  its continued success in retaining and growing the deposit base in a highly competitive environment and in managing its deposit pricing structure as rates rise on alternative financial products

this allocation is based on the absolute dollar amounts of change due solely to changes in volume or rate 
net interest income te increased million  or  in compared to  driven by growth in average earning assets between these periods and a basis point widening of the net interest margin 
the most important factors behind the increase in net interest income in were loan growth  including growth through acquisitions  an improved mix of earning assets  higher short term market interest rates  active management of the pricing structure for both loans and deposits  and continued liquidity in the deposit base 
average loans increased in and comprised of average earning assets for the year  up from in rising benchmark rates for the large variable rate segment of whitney s loan portfolio were evident in the basis point improvement in loan yields te between and the yield te on the largely fixed rate investment portfolio fluctuated within a narrow range during and  declining basis points between these periods 
as discussed earlier  whitney increased its investment in short term liquidity management instruments in response to the rapid build up of the deposit base after the storms in  although such investments comprised only of average earning assets for the overall yield te on average earning assets was in compared to in  an increase of basis points 
there was a small favorable shift in the overall funding mix in compared to  mainly reflecting the rapid build up of lower cost deposits in after the late summer storms 
average noninterest bearing deposits funded of average earning assets in  up from in  and the percentage of funding from all noninterest bearing sources increased to in from in the prior year 
within interest bearing sources of funds  there was some shift toward higher cost sources 
higher cost sources of funds totaled of average earning assets in and in  while funding from lower cost interest bearing deposits decreased to of earning assets in from in the overall cost of funds increased basis points between and whitney continued to manage the rate structure for its different deposit products during  and the overall rate on lower cost interest bearing deposits increased basis points in compared to rates paid on higher cost funding sources in increased more rapidly  having risen basis points compared to the cost of attracting public funds and excess liquidity from certain corporate and private banking customers was again a factor in this increase 
provision for credit losses whitney provided million for credit losses in the provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses as well as the provision for loss reserves established against unfunded credit commitments 
in  the company recognized a million provision for credit losses that reflected management s early estimate of the impact of the storms on credit quality 
net charge offs totaled million in and million in for a more detailed discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses  the reserve for unfunded credit commitments  nonperforming assets and general credit quality  including management s approach to assessing the storms impact on credit quality  see the earlier section on loans  credit risk management and allowance and reserve for credit losses 
the future level of the allowance and reserves and the provisions for credit losses will reflect management s ongoing evaluation of credit risk  based on established internal policies and practices 
noninterest income table shows the components of noninterest income for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component

income from service charges on deposit accounts declined  or million  in  following an decline between and service charges include periodic account maintenance fees for both business and personal customers  charges for specific transactions or services  such as processing return items or wire transfers  and other revenue associated with deposit accounts  such as commissions on check sales 
account maintenance fees for business customers were down  or million  in  after decreasing  or million  in the fees charged on a large number of business accounts are based on an analysis of account activity  and these accounts are allowed to offset accumulated charges with an earnings credit based on balances maintained in the account 
the rate used to calculate the earnings credit is based on short term market rates 
analysis account fees declined  or million  in  and  or million  in  reflecting in large part the increase in the earnings credit rate beginning with the latter half of analysis fee income in each year was also negatively impacted by higher levels of liquidity in the deposit base and some reduction in the volume of chargeable transactions 
high deposit base liquidity was also a factor behind the 
million decrease in personal account service charges between and  as was the impact of the loss of some storm dislocated customers 
there was a comparable reduction in personal account revenue between and that largely reflected the loss of lower balance customers to competitive no fee account products  which have been aggressively promoted in parts of whitney s market area 
charges earned on specific transactions and services in were down 
million compared to this followed a decrease of million in compared to  substantially all of which related to fees for items returned for insufficient funds and for overdrafts 
although broad trends in how customers execute transactions have been reducing charging opportunities  the decrease in fees during was for the most part a function of the higher deposit account balances maintained after the storms by customers in the areas most impacted 
this phenomenon and the reduced level of deposit charges earned continued through much of the first half of bank card fees increased  or million  in and  or million  in this income category includes fees from activity on bank issued debit and credit cards 
debit card fee income was up  or million  in  following a  or million  increase in transaction volume was up approximately in each year 
over half of the volume increase in came in the last quarter of that year  indicating in part a change in payment behavior within the customer base dislocated by the late summer storms 
some continuation of this behavioral change was also evident in activity levels 
fee income from credit card activity grew in  generally consistent with the growth in transaction volume  and was up in the addition of st national s trust business  ongoing customer development efforts and improved market conditions all helped increase trust service fees by  or million  in this followed a increase in compared to that was mainly driven by new business 
whitney has positioned relationship officers to attract and service trust and wealth management customers across its market area 
fee income generated by whitney s secondary mortgage market operations increased in and in completed sales of home loans totaled approximately million in  million in and million in production in storm impacted areas was disrupted for a period  but the impact was not significant to overall operations 
these disruptions did  however  delay the completion of a number of loan sales  caused the renegotiation of sales contracts and reduced profitability in investment services income increased  or million  in  following a increase in compared to investment services include stock brokerage and annuity sales as well as fixed income securities transactions for correspondent banks and other commercial and personal customers 
the investment service operations of acquired banks contributed to the income improvements in both and market conditions had dampened the demand for fixed income transactions among whitney s customer base in both and fees generated by the insurance operations acquired with destin in were the main factor behind the increases in the total for other fees and charges for both and rising premiums and changes in the type of coverage available from different insurance carriers contributed to the improvement for during  pulse eft association was sold to discover financial services 
as a member of the pulse electronic payment network  whitney received distributions totaling approximately million that were reported with other operating income for the net gain on sales and other revenue from foreclosed assets includes income from grandfathered assets that varies from year to year as opportunities for sales arise 
the net gains recognized in each period from dispositions of surplus banking property are also shown in table management evaluates its banking facilities on an ongoing basis to identify possible under utilization and to determine the need for functional improvements  relocations or possible sales 
noninterest expense table shows the components of noninterest expense for each year in the three year period ended december   along with the percent changes between years for each component 
noninterest expense increased  or million  in  following an increase of  or million  from to incremental operating costs associated with acquired operations  including the amortization of acquired intangibles  totaled approximately million in and million in as noted earlier  included approximately million in expenses associated with the late summer hurricanes of the expense associated with initiatives to reduce whitney s exposure to disasters and make its disaster recovery plans and operating arrangements more resilient totaled approximately million 
this total includes both recurring items as well as certain periodic or nonrecurring items 
the recurring items mainly impact the occupancy and data processing and equipment expense categories  and reflect the impact of the acceleration of some planned system upgrades 
periodic or nonrecurring items included million for professional services  million for contingency housing contracts  and million for redundant or special temporary telecommunication services during the system upgrade 
these initiatives should significantly reduce the direct and indirect costs associated with future natural disasters 
as a result of the catastrophic storm season  the company also saw the cost of its casualty insurance  included in net occupancy expense  increase by million in the difficult insurance market is impacting businesses and individuals across the gulf coast region  and the coverage limits available for wind damage have been reduced significantly 
in addition  whitney expensed disaster response costs  insurance claim management fees and casualty and operating losses directly related to the storms totaling million in  compared to million in these charges are included in miscellaneous operating losses 
some additional costs  mainly related to services to help manage insurance claims  will continue into the cost of the contingency housing in and a 
million contribution to a disaster relief fund for the company s employees in each year have been reported in the total of other noninterest expense

base pay  the cost of contract labor and compensation earned under sales based incentive programs increased  or million  in  with approximately million of the total increase related to the staff of acquired operations 
this followed an increase of  or million  from to  when acquired operations contributed a little more than half of the total change 
whitney s full time equivalent staff grew on average by less than in compared to excluding the impact of acquisitions in each year  there would have been a reduction in the average staff level  reflecting the impact of temporary storm related attrition and remaining branch closures 
the benefit to expense in from this staff reduction was offset by additional contract labor and by salary scale adjustments needed to address post storm changes in the cost of living in impacted areas and increased competition for labor resources 
the average staff level grew in  substantially all related to acquisitions  although there was some branch expansion and strategic placement of additional relationship officers 
compensation expense associated with management incentive programs increased by million in  almost all related to share based compensation 
participation in the share based incentive compensation programs has expanded in recent years  and the awards for emphasized full value grants of performance based restricted stock units over stock options with a lesser grant date fair value  partly in response to the issuance of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which was effective for awards after december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements located in item for more information on share based compensation and this new accounting standard 
management incentive program expense increased million in compared to this increase mainly related to the cash bonus incentive program and reflected whitney s performance  as adjusted for certain storm related items  in relation to its designated peer group  an increased emphasis on performance based pay in the overall compensation packages for top management beginning in  and expanded management participation in the program 
employee benefits expense increased  or million  in  and was up  or million  in the major components of employee benefits expense  in addition to payroll taxes  are the cost of providing health benefits for active and retired employees and the cost of providing pension benefits through both the defined benefit plans and a k employee savings plan 
the performance of the pension trust fund and trends in market yields on fixed income securities in one period can cause the actuarially determined periodic expense for the defined benefit pension plan to move in the opposite direction in future periods  holding other variables constant 
the 
million increase in pension expense in followed a moderate decline during in the market yields referenced to determine the appropriate rate for discounting projected pension benefits  and investment performance in was below the long term expected rate of return 
the effect of these factors on pension expense was somewhat offset by the favorable impact of a million employer contribution to the pension trust toward the end of pension expense increased million in following a relatively sharp drop during in fixed income market yields and the discount rate 
investment performance in was in line with the long term expected rate of return 
pension expense is expected to decrease in  reflecting an increase in referenced market yields during and an investment performance above the long term expected return 
trends in fixed income market yields also impact the actuarial valuation results for postretirement health benefits as do trends in actual benefit outlays 
unfavorable benefit experience and lower market yields in both and contributed to expense increases of 
million in and 
million in planned changes in to postretirement health benefits offered by the company are expected to lead to a significant reduction in this expense category from the million total recognized in  including recognition of a curtailment gain in the first quarter of net occupancy expense increased  or million  in  including million of incremental costs associated with acquired operations 
in addition to the storm related factors mentioned earlier  the remaining increase for was driven by de novo branch expansion and the completion of capital projects on storm damaged facilities  higher energy costs  normal lease and service fee escalations  and work on a number of maintenance and repair projects  some of which had been deferred from in  net occupancy expense increased  or million  including million of incremental costs associated with acquired operations 
there was also a net increase in occupancy expense from the addition of several new branches and the replacement or relocation of several other existing facilities 
although storm related facility closures and asset retirements reduced certain recurring occupancy costs after the storms in  these savings were for the most part offset by a corresponding loss of office rental revenue 
equipment and data processing expense increased  or million  in  of which over million was associated with the initiatives to improve operational resiliency in the event of a natural disaster  including installation of a new mainframe computer and related software 
incremental costs of 
million for acquired operations  de novo branch expansion and projects to enhance operational capacity and efficiency were the main contributors to the remaining increase 
in  equipment and data processing expense decreased  or 
million  although there was 
million in added costs for acquired operations 
both and benefited from the phase in of the atm outsourcing contract during  as discussed further below  which gradually eliminated the expense of owning and maintaining these machines 
the total expense for professional services  both legal and other services  increased million in  after having been relatively stable over the previous two years 
the expense for nonlegal professional services was up million in  including the million for work on the initiatives to improve the company s disaster risk profile noted earlier 
in  whitney engaged consultants in the planning of important upgrades to major customer interface tools and core application systems  the development and implementation of several product enhancements  and the assessment of compliance and control processes 
services will continue in through the implementation of projects still in the planning stage at year end consulting services were also used during for the executive succession planning process  as well as for the placement of experienced customer relationship managers  particularly in newer parts of the company s market area 
nonlegal professional service expense increased 
million in compared to  mainly related to consulting work on a variety of projects  such as new product development and the evaluation of compliance programs and optimal resource allocations  none of which were individually significant 
legal expense  which covers services for both loan collection efforts and general corporate matters  increased  or 
million  in  but was down  or 
million  in compared to loan collection efforts in  including work with storm impacted customers  and storm related disruptions to law firms and the legal system in late combined to account for most of the increase in legal expense in bank and branch acquisitions in recent years led to an increase in amortization of intangibles in both and  mainly associated with the value of deposit relationships acquired in these transactions 
amortization expense of million is scheduled for  which does not include the impact of a pending business acquisition expected to be completed in the first quarter of note to the consolidated financial statements located in item reviews completed and pending acquisitions 
the expense for security and other outsourced services increased  or million  in this followed a  or million  increase in compared to approximately million of the increase in and million in related to a new arrangement to outsource virtually all aspects of the bank s atm operations that was phased in during this contract allowed whitney to avoid significant costs to upgrade its atms to comply with new regulatory mandates 
acquired operations added 
million to expense and 
million to during  the bank also incurred additional expense for the transportation of daily work  mainly reflecting changes in processing sites in the post storm operating environment as well as the use of more costly delivery methods for a number of months following the storms 
the cost of certain services in storm impacted areas has also increased with local wage scales 
management directed additional resources to advertising and promotional activities in both and the additional expense in supported campaigns to introduce new and improved products 
during  management executed a campaign aimed at enhanced image awareness and brand differentiation throughout much of whitney s market area 
no major campaigns were conducted in  and current plans for advertising and promotional activities in indicate a reduced level of expense for the coming year 
bank card processing services expense will vary mainly with changes in transaction volume on bank issued credit cards 
transaction volumes and bank card fee income are discussed in the earlier section on noninterest income 
in november  the fdic adopted final regulations that set the deposit insurance assessment rates that took effect in the new rate structure imposes a minimum assessment of from five to seven cents for every of domestic deposits on institutions that are assigned the lowest risk category under the fdic s risk based assessment system 
under the previous rate structure  this group of institutions  which includes the bank  had been charged no assessment for a number of years 
based on recent deposit levels and the bank s current risk classification  the annual expense for the minimum assessment would range from approximately million to million 
a one time assessment credit  currently estimated at million  is available to offset up to of the assessment 
any remaining credit can be used to offset up to of subsequent annual assessments through as noted earlier  miscellaneous operating losses included various charges directly related to the storms totaling million in and million in in  operating losses included a million lease abandonment charge related to the physical reorganization of the bank s houston operations and a 
million casualty loss for property damage sustained when hurricane ivan struck the florida alabama coastal border during that year 
the expense categories included in other operating expense were up  or million  on a combined basis in  including the cost of disaster contingency housing and other storm related items mentioned above 
the other main factors contributing to this increase from were directors compensation  including the expense of the annual stock option award beginning in  and the incremental cost of acquired operations 
total other operating expense increased  or million  in compared to the totals for both and also included a 
million contribution to a disaster assistance fund for whitney s employees 
income taxes the company provided for income tax expense at an effective rate of in  in and in the effective tax rate has been lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily because of tax exempt interest income from the financing of state and local governments and the availability of tax credits generated by investments in affordable housing projects 
federal disaster relief legislation passed in december provided for a tax credit to businesses in the storm affected areas based on certain salaries paid to qualifying employees 
the following reconciles reported income tax expense to that computed at the statutory federal tax rate for each year in the three year period ended december  table income taxes in thousands income tax expense at of pre tax income increase decrease resulting from tax exempt income low income housing credits disaster relief credit state income tax and miscellaneous items income tax expense reported louisiana sourced income of commercial banks is not subject to state income taxes 
rather  banks in louisiana pay a tax based on the value of their capital stock in lieu of income and franchise taxes  and this tax is allocated to parishes in which the banks maintain branches 
whitney s corporate value tax is included in noninterest expense 
this expense will fluctuate in part based on the growth in the bank s equity and earnings and in part based on market valuation trends for the banking industry 
fourth quarter results whitney earned million for the quarter ended december   compared with net income of million for the fourth quarter of per share earnings were 
per basic share and 
per diluted share in s fourth quarter  compared to 
and  respectively  for the year earlier period 
the results for the fourth quarter of included approximately million in expenses associated with the hurricanes 
this total included both the cost to implement initiatives that reduced the exposure of the company s operations to future disasters and improved operational resilience as well as certain increased operating costs and additional expenditures and charges directly related to the storms 
the storms impact on earnings for the fourth quarter of was mainly reflected in a million charge for disaster response costs and losses  the loss of certain revenue and the recognition of a million federal income tax credit available to businesses in the storm affected area 
selected fourth quarter highlights follow whitney s net interest income te increased million  or  compared to the fourth quarter of  on a increase in average earning assets and a wider net interest margin 
the net interest margin te was for the fourth quarter of  up basis points from the year earlier period 
the overall yield on earning assets increased basis points  reflecting higher benchmark rates for the large variable rate segment of whitney s loan portfolio plus higher yields on investment securities and short term liquidity management investments 
the cost of funds increased basis points between the fourth quarters of and this increase was driven by higher competitive market rates as well as a shift in the funding mix to higher cost sources which stemmed in part from the anticipated reduction in and reallocation of some of the post storm deposit accumulations 
net interest income te for the fourth quarter of was down million  or  from this year s third quarter  on a comparable percentage decrease in average earning assets and a basis point decline in the net interest margin 
whitney made a million provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of  compared to a provision of 
million in the fourth quarter of the total of loans criticized through the company s credit risk rating process increased by million during the fourth quarter of  and the further downgrade of two storm impacted credits contributed to some increase in the risk posture of the criticized loan pool 
recoveries exceeded loan charge offs by 
million in s fourth quarter  compared to a 
million net charge off in the fourth quarter of noninterest income increased  or million  from the fourth quarter of improvements were noted in a number of income categories  reflecting internal growth  contributions from acquired operations and  for certain categories  the special post storm conditions that affected performance in the year earlier period 
deposit service charge income was up  or million 
whitney s ability to generate deposit service charges had been severely limited in the fourth quarter of by the post storm deposit build up and storm related disruptions to normal customer and bank activity 
noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of increased  or million  from s fourth quarter  including an additional million of costs and charges associated with the storms
