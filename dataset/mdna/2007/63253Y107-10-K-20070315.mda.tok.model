item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of nahc should be read in conjunction with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we provide property and casualty insurance and insurance related services to individuals  families and businesses in the state of new jersey 
we have been able to capitalize upon what we consider an attractive opportunity in the new jersey insurance market through our extensive knowledge of the new jersey insurance market and regulatory environment  our business model which is designed to align our partner agents interests with management by requiring many of them to retain an ownership stake in us  our packaged product that includes private passenger automobile  homeowners  personal excess umbrella and specialty property liability coverage  and our insurance related services businesses 
in  we made significant progress toward carrying out the business strategies we have set out for national atlantic as a public company 
we continued to capture an increasingly larger share of our partner agents existing customer base and to diversify our business portfolio of automobile  homeowners and commercial lines policies 
our plan for future growth relates to capturing an increasingly larger share of our partner agents business and cross selling our automobile  homeowners and business insurance products to their existing customers 
we also plan to capture more of our partner agents existing customers by reaching out to additional demographics not currently suited to our hpp packaged product 
our new mono line automobile product  salesmarked bluestar car insurance  is scheduled to launch in early and will be targeted to our partner agents customers who do not require the broader coverage of our hpp product 
as of december   our insurance subsidiary  proformance insurance company proformance  was the eleventh largest and one of the fastest growing provider of private passenger auto insurance in new jersey  based on direct written premiums of companies writing more than million of premiums annually over the past three years  according to am best 
from through  we experienced a compound annual growth rate  as our direct written premiums for all lines of business we write  including homeowners and commercial lines  increased from million in to million in as of december   our stockholders equity was million  up from stockholders equity of million as of december   reflecting a compound annual growth rate 
included in stockholders equity is million as a result of our initial public offering  which was completed on april  direct written premiums for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million in the comparable period 
for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the following our closed agents business that was acquired as part of previous replacement carrier transactions with ocic  met p c and sentry decreased by million due to the fact that as a result of the continued increase in the competitive nature of the new jersey auto insurance market those agents were able to place that business with other carriers in the new jersey market 
new business generated by our partner agents for the year ended december  was million  offset by attrition of existing business of million 
for the twelve months ended december   direct written premium generated from the hanover and hartford renewal business was approximately and million  respectively 
we manage and report our business as a single segment based upon several factors 
although our insurance subsidiary  proformance insurance company writes private passenger automobile  homeowners and commercial lines insurance  we consider those operating segments as one operating segment due to the fact that the nature of the products are similar  the nature of the production processes are similar  the type of class of customer for the products are similar  the methods used to distribute the products are similar and the nature of the regulatory environment is similar 
in addition  these lines of business have historically demonstrated similar economic characteristics and as such are aggregated and reported as a single segment 
also  in addition to proformance  all other operating segments wholly owned by the company are aggregated and reported as a single segment due to the fact that the nature of the products are similar  the nature of the production processes are similar  the type of class of customer for the products are similar  the methods used to distribute the products are similar and the nature of the regulatory environment is similar 
as a densely populated state  a coastal state  and a state where automobile insurance has historically been prominent in local politics  new jersey has historically presented a challenging underwriting environment for automobile and homeowners insurance coverage 
as a result of new jersey s take all comers requirement  we are obligated to underwrite a broad spectrum of personal automobile insurance risks 
to address this potential problem  since proformance has utilized a tiered rating system to price its policies  which includes five rating tiers based upon the driving records of the policyholders 
the purpose of the rating tiers is to modify the premiums to be charged for each insured vehicle on the personal automobile policy so that the premiums charged accurately reflect the underwriting exposures presented to proformance 
as of december   the rating tier modifiers and the distribution of risks within the tiers were as follows premium percent of modifications total tier designation factor vehicles tier a tier one tier two tier three tier four proformance applies the modification factor to each tier to produce a consistent loss ratio across all tiers 
proformance does not segregate its loss reserves by tier  but rather by line of business 
since the actual distribution of risk may vary from the distribution of risk proformance assumed in developing the modification factors  proformance cannot be certain that an underwriting profit will be produced collectively or in any tier 
our financial results may be affected by a variety of external factors that indirectly impact our premiums and or claims expense 
such factors may include  but are not limited to the recent rise in gasoline prices may serve to decrease the number of miles driven by our policyholders and result in lower frequency of automobile claims  and an evolving set of legal standards by which we are required to pay claims may result in significant variability in our loss reserves over time 
we believe that proper recognition of emerging trends  and an active response to those trends  is essential for our business 
in addition  we believe that the recent entrants to the new jersey personal automobile insurance marketplace  such as mercury general  geico and progressive  will provide a new level of competition not previously experienced by us or by our long term competitors  which could have a material effect on our ability to meet sales goals or maintain adequate rates for our insurance products 
since we operate in a coastal state and we underwrite property insurance  we are subject to catastrophic weather events  which may have significant impact upon our claims expense or our ability to collect the proceeds from our third party reinsurers 
we also underwrite commercial insurance business and we expect that the rate increases on those policies that we have experienced over the last three years will moderate and that rate level reductions may ensue  impacting our ability to maintain our underwriting margins on this business 
during the prior four years  much of our premium growth and capitalization growth have resulted from our replacement carrier transactions 
for the year ended december   we derived no revenue from replacement carrier transactions  compared to and million for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   respectively 
this constituted of our total revenue for the year ended december  and and  respectively  of our total revenue in the prior years 
for the years ended december   and  the company paid million  million   respectively  in connection with fees paid in consideration of the acquisition of policy renewal rights 
our strategy includes entering into additional replacement carrier transactions as opportunities arise 
however  due to improvements in the new jersey insurance market during  it is not likely that we will enter into replacement carrier transactions which have as significant an impact on the company s operations or are comparable in size to those entered into prior to as a result of these transactions  we increased the number of independent insurance agencies who are shareholders in nahc and who  with their aggregate premium volume  provide what we believe are significant growth opportunities for us 
our strategy is to underwrite an increased share of those agencies business now underwritten by competing carriers 
successful execution of our intended plan will require an underwriting operation designed to attract and retain more of our agencies clientele  and may be affected by lower priced competing products or enhanced sales incentive compensation plans by our competitors 
these factors may require us to increase our new business acquisition expenses from the levels currently experienced to achieve significant new product sales 
in our replacement carrier transactions  we agreed to offer replacement coverage to the subject policyholders at their next nominal policy renewal date 
the policyholders are under no obligation to accept our replacement coverage offer 
policyholders who accept our replacement insurance coverage become policyholders of proformance and enjoy the standard benefits of being a proformance policyholder 
for example  these policyholders enjoy the limitation we provide on our ability to increase annual premiums 
we cannot increase the annual premiums paid by these policyholders by more than fifteen percent for three years  unless there is an event causing a change in rating characteristics  such as an auto accident 
those policyholders choosing not to accept the proformance replacement insurance coverage due to rate or coverage disparities or individual consumer choice must seek replacement coverage with another carrier 
once the proformance replacement offer has been rejected by a policyholder  proformance has no further obligation to that policyholder 
on september   the company announced that proformance had entered into a replacement carrier transaction with the hartford financial services group  inc  which we refer to as the hartford  whereby certain subsidiaries of the hartford hartford fire insurance company  hartford casualty insurance company  and twin city fire insurance would transfer their renewal obligations for new jersey homeowners  dwelling  fire  and personal excess liabilities policies sold through independent agents to proformance 
under the terms of the transaction  proformance is in the process of offering renewal policies to approximately  qualified policyholders of the hartford 
we received final approval of this transaction from the njdobi on november   the closing date 
upon the closing  proformance was required to pay to the hartford a one time fee of  in addition  a one time payment equal to of the written premium of the retained business will be paid to the hartford within days of the end of the twelve month non renewal period 
the hartford is not liable for any fees and or other amounts to be paid to proformance and as such proformance will not recognize any replacement carrier revenue from this transaction 
the revenue that will be recognized as part of this transaction will be from the premium generated by the policies that renew with proformance 
as of december   the direct written premium generated from the hartford renewal business was  on february  the company announced that proformance had entered into a replacement carrier transaction with hanover insurance group  which we refer to as hanover  whereby hanover would transfer their renewal obligations for new jersey automobile  homeowners  dwelling fire  personal excess liability and inland marine policies sold through independent agents to proformance 
under the terms of the transaction  proformance is in the process of offering renewal policies to approximately  qualified policyholders of hanover 
nahc and proformance received approval of this transaction from the njdobi on february  upon the closing  proformance was required to pay to hanover a one time fee of  and within days of the closing   was due to reimburse hanover for its expenses associated with this transaction 
in addition  the company will make two annual payments equal to of the written premium on renewed business for the preceding twelve months  calculated at the month and month anniversaries  payable to hanover within days of such anniversary dates 
hanover is not liable for any fees and or other amounts to be paid to proformance and as such proformance will not recognize any replacement carrier revenue from this transaction 
the revenue that will be recognized as part of this transaction will be from the premium generated by the policies that renew with proformance 
as of december   the direct written premium generated from hanover renewal business was  with respect to our replacement carrier transaction for the year with ocic and ocnj  on february  proformance notified ocnj that ocnj owed proformance  for the year in connection with the requirement that a premium to surplus ratio of to be maintained on the ocnj renewal business 
pursuant to our agreement  ocnj had until may  to make payment to us 
subsequent to the notification provided to ocic and ocnj  we had several discussions with ocic relating to certain components to the underlying calculation which supports the amount owed to proformance for the year 
as part of these discussions  ocic had requested additional supporting documentation and raised issues with respect to approximately  of loss adjustment expense  approximately  of commission expense  and approximately  of njaire assessments  or a total of  allocated to ocnj 
we recorded  the difference between the  we notified ocnj they owed us  and the  as outlined above as replacement carrier revenue from related party in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  with respect to the ocic replacement carrier transaction 
we recorded  because it was management s best estimate of the amount for which we believed collectability was reasonably assured based on several factors 
first  the calculation to determine the amount owed by ocic to us is complex and certain elements of the calculation are significantly dependent on management s estimates and judgment and thus more susceptible to challenge by ocic 
we also note our experience in the past in negotiating these issues with ocic 
for example  in we notified ocnj that ocnj owed proformance approximately  for after negotiations we ultimately received  accordingly  because of the nature of the calculation  the inherent subjectivity in establishing certain estimates upon which the calculation is based  and our experience from  management s best estimate of the amount for for which we believed collectability from ocic was reasonably assured was  on june   we received  from ocic in settlement of the amounts due to proformance  which differs from the  we had recorded as a receivable due from ocic as outlined above 
the difference of  between the receivable we had recorded  due from ocic and the actual settlement payment received from ocic  came as a result of a dispute between the company and ocic regarding  of njaire assessments and approximately  of commission expenses included in the underlying calculation which supported the amounts due to proformance for the year  the final year of our three year agreement with ocic 
the  was recorded as a bad debt expense in the company s consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  with respect to our replacement carrier transaction with sentry insurance  in the event that the premium to surplus ratio for the sentry insurance business written by proformance exceeded to during a specified period  sentry insurance was obligated to pay to proformance such additional sums of money as necessary  up to an aggregate limit of  to reduce the premium to surplus ratio for the sentry insurance business written by proformance to not less than to on february  proformance notified sentry insurance that sentry insurance owed proformance  for the year in connection with the requirement 
on may   we received  from sentry insurance in settlement of the amounts owed to us 
prior to the company s initial public offering  the company limited the amount of business that partner agents could write with proformance because of its limited capital 
however  following the company s initial public offering on april   the company contributed additional capital to proformance 
accordingly  on june   the company held a meeting with partner agents to inform them that the limitations historically placed on them with respect to placing new business with proformance were no longer applicable due to proformance s enhanced capital adequacy 
in the new jersey supreme court s decision in june of in diprospero v 
penn  et al  the court eliminated certain restrictions on the ability of plaintiffs to obtain non economic damages  such as for pain and suffering 
as a result of this decision  we have adjusted our reserves to include additional personal injury protection no fault losses and legal defense costs severities because of the potential for an increase in the number of litigated cases 
on march   the board of directors of the company discussed extending the exercise period of stock options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock granted under its nonstatutory stock option plan the plan on june  to three individuals  two of whom are currently executive officers and one of whom is currently a director of the company 
these stock options were scheduled to expire on june   ten years after the date of issuance 
the board of directors discussed extending the expiration date of these stock options from june  until december   with the effective date of the extension being june  this proposal to extend the exercise period for such stock options was approved by the board of directors at its meeting held on june   subject to shareholder approval 
the extension of these options was approved by the company s shareholders at the company s annual meeting of shareholders which was held on september  fp skip campion  the company s former vice chairman and the former president of proformance  passed away on january  under the terms of the plan and the applicable stock option agreements  if an optionee dies without having fully exercised any outstanding stock options  the right to exercise such stock options expires ninety days following the optionee s death 
accordingly  the expiration date of mr 
campion s stock options none of which had previously been exercised was accelerated to april  since the estate of mr 
campion did not exercise these stock options on or prior to april   the stock options were forfeited 
on june   the board of directors of the company approved  subject to shareholder approval  a grant of new nonqualified stock options to the estate of mr 
campion  to preserve the value of mr 
campion s stock options that expired on april  the new stock options are subject to the same terms and conditions as the forfeited stock options  including the exercise price and number of shares subject to each option  except that the new stock options would expire on december  approval of the extension of the options granted during and the grant of new stock options to the estate of mr 
campion was received at the company s annual meeting of shareholders on september  the fair market value of the company s stock on september  was  therefore  the company recognized  as compensation expense related to the extension of options in its consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  the company also recognized  as compensation expense related to the grant of new options in its consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  on march   the board of directors of national atlantic holdings corporation nahc approved the compensation committee s recommendation to grant  stock appreciation rights sars to the executive officers and other key employees under the company s stock and incentive plan 
the sars were granted with a base price of per share  which was the closing price of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market on the date of grant 
in accordance with sfas r  the company records share based compensation liabilities at fair value or a portion thereof depending upon the percentage of requisite service that has been rendered at the reporting date based on the black scholes valuation model and will remeasure the liability at each reporting date through the date of settlement  consequently  compensation cost recognized through each period of the vesting period as well as each period throughout the date of settlement will vary based on the award s fair value and the vesting schedule 
the company reported  as a component of other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and other operating and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income  share based compensation expense of  for the year ended december  on january   proformance entered into an auto physical damage quota share contract with odyssey america reinsurance corporation 
under the terms of this contract  proformance ceded  of written premiums and  of beginning unearned premium reserves to odyssey re with respect to business written between january  and september  ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses were  and ceded reserves including incurred but not reported ibnr reserves was  on september   proformance commuted the auto physical damage quota share contract with odyssey re 
the commutation was initiated in september and all items previously recorded in connection with the agreement were reversed as of that period 
the transaction was recorded as a decrease of ceded written premium of  a decrease in ceded commissions of  and a decrease in ceded unearned premiums of  the overall net effect of the commutation is a loss of  revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the net premiums we earn  net investment income we earn on our invested assets and revenue associated with replacement carrier transactions 
net earned premiums is the difference between the premiums we earn from the sales of insurance policies and the portion of those premiums that we cede to our reinsurers 
the revenue we earned from replacement carrier transactions relates to the funds that we received to assume the renewal obligations of those books of business 
revenues from replacement carrier transactions are recognized pro rata over the period that we complete our obligations under the terms of the agreement  typically ranging from six months to a year  determined by the renewal option period of the policyholders 
certain replacement carrier contracts require additional consideration to be paid to us based on an evaluation of the ratio of premiums written to surplus 
the calculation is performed and related revenue is recognized as earned annually  pursuant to the terms of the contract 
certain other transactions  such as the hanover and hartford transactions described above  require us to pay additional consideration in the future 
we did not record any replacement carrier revenue for the year ended december  and our strategy includes entering into additional replacement carrier transactions as opportunities arise 
however  due to improvements in the new jersey insurance market during  it is not likely that we will enter into replacement carrier transactions which have as significant an impact on the company s operations  or are comparable in size to those entered into prior to investment income consists of the income we earn on our fixed income and equity investments as well as short term investments 
the other income we earn consists of service fees charged to insureds that pay on installment plans  commission received by national atlantic insurance agency from third party business  and revenue from our contract with at t under which we provide claims handling and risk data reporting on general liability  automobile liability and physical damage and household move claims 
expenses our expenses consist primarily of three types losses and loss adjustment expenses  including estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods  less the portion of those insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses that we cede to our reinsurers  and acquisition expenses  which consist of commissions we pay our agents 
in addition  underwriting  acquisition and insurance related expenses include premium taxes and company expenses related to the production and underwriting of insurance policies  less ceding commissions that we receive under the terms of our reinsurance contracts  and other operating and general expenses which include general and administrative expenses 
the provision for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses includes individual case estimates  principally on the basis of reports received from claim adjusters employed by proformance  losses reported prior to the close of the period  and estimates with respect to incurred but not reported losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of anticipated salvage and subrogation 
the method of making such estimates and for establishing the resulting reserves is continually reviewed and updated  and adjustments are reflected in current operations 
the estimates are determined by management and are based upon industry data relating to loss and loss adjustment expense ratios as well as proformance s historical data 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance related expenses include policy acquisition expenses which consist of commissions and other underwriting expenses  which are costs that vary with and are directly related to the underwriting of new and renewal policies and are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
also included in underwriting  acquisition and related insurance expenses are njaire assessments  professional fees and other expenses relating to insurance operations 
other operating and general expenses consist primarily of professional fees  stock based compensation expense and other general expenses which are not directly associated with insurance operations and relate primarily to costs incurred by our holding company 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  these estimates and assumptions are subject to change and thus impact amounts reported in the future 
we have identified below two accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of these policies 
in addition  please see overview above for a discussion of the amount we estimated and recorded as replacement carrier revenue from related party in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  with respect to the ocic replacement carrier transaction 
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting to us of that loss and our final payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities 
our reserves represent actuarially determined best estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the expenses of investigating and paying those losses  or loss adjustment expenses 
every quarter  we review our previously established reserves and adjust them  if necessary 
when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
in accordance with industry practice  we also maintain reserves for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported 
incurred but not yet reported reserves are determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial reserving techniques on the basis of our historical information and experience 
we review incurred but not yet reported reserves quarterly and make adjustments if necessary 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historical loss experience and that of the industry  trends in claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  our claims processing procedures  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages  and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
a change in any of these factors from the assumptions implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves  and the difference can be material 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves and currently established reserves may not prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are strengthened  the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a credit to earnings in the period that redundancy is recognized 
for the year ended december   reserves decreased by million primarily due to a decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for the same period 
this decrease can be attributed to a decline in earned premium  a reduction in claim frequency in private passenger automobile coverage and significant growth in commercial lines business  which in  have exhibited lower loss ratios 
for the year ended december   prior year reserves increased by million 
the actuarial estimates as of december  have shown to be adequate overall 
this increase is due to favorable development in bodily injury and no fault coverages offset by a reduction in ceded loss estimates for prior years 
for the year ended december   we increased reserves for prior years by million 
this increase was due to i increases in average severity for personal injury protection no fault losses of million ii higher commercial auto liability projected loss ratios for due to the fact that actual loss development was higher than expected for those years  resulting in an increase of million and iii homeowners losses of million and other liability losses of million 
this development was partially offset by continued favorable trends in loss development for property damage losses million  auto physical damage losses million  and bodily injury losses of million  as reported claims frequency has dropped significantly and we have reduced our projected loss ratios in recognition of this trend 
for the year ended december   we reduced reserves for prior years by million because our actual loss experience observed during the period  especially during the fourth quarter of  was slightly lower than expected due to a reduction in the frequency of claims reported during the fourth quarter of in addition  as more fully described in note reinsurance activity to our consolidated financial statements  the commutation referred to for had no impact on our consolidated unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of december  in addition  we increased reserves by million for the year ended december  the incurred losses related to prior years of million in included a commutation of a reinsurance agreement of million which was offset by favorable loss development on prior accident year reserves 
we have made a change in a key assumption to the estimates of liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended december  during the year ended december   there was a change in the loss reserving procedures implemented by our claims department 
higher initial factor reserves are being posted for new liability claims and the timeframes for establishing an ultimate value of liability has been accelerated 
as a result  we placed more reliance on projected claim counts and paid loss development methods rather than on incurred loss development techniques 
the table below sets forth the types of reserves we maintain for our lines of business and indicates the amount of reserves as of december  for each line of business 
national atlantic holdings corporation breakout of reserves by line of business as of december  total direct assumed balance case case direct assumed sheet reserves reserves ibnr ibnr reserves in thousands line of business fire allied homeowners personal auto commercial auto other liability total reserves less reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses total net reserves in establishing our net reserves as of december   our chief actuarial officer has determined that the range of reserve estimates  at that date  was between million and million 
the amount of net reserves at december   which represents the best estimate of management and our actuaries within that range  was million 
there are two major factors that could result in ultimate losses below management s best estimate the volume of reported losses and reported claim frequency for the accident years and are at a lower rate than prior periods  especially for personal auto liability 
if this development continues  reserves for accident years could be redundant 
we believe that the claims department has improved its claims handling practices during the past two years with regard to claims reserving and settlement 
these improvements could result in lower loss development factors than those which currently underlie our actuarial estimates 
there are two major factors that could result in ultimate losses above management s best estimate loss trends both frequency and severity have been declining in recent years in the new jersey personal auto insurance market 
if loss trends become unfavorable  our reserves could be deficient 
in addition  the diprospero v 
penn 
decision of the new jersey supreme court  discussed above  which potentially increases a claimant s right to sue for serious injury  could impact future claims frequency 
claims for uninsured motorists generally have a longer development period than other liability losses 
if the frequency of uninsured motorist claims increases beyond our current estimated levels  loss emergence could be greater than what we projected in our loss development analysis 
investment accounting policy impairment in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its applications of certain investments fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and how to measure such impairment loss

the company has complied with the disclosure requirements of eitf  which were effective december  and remain in effect 
our principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
recognition of income ceases when a bond goes into default 
we evaluate whether impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and amount of decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations we use in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or subsection  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairment of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies and vii management s intent and ability to hold securities to recovery 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
insurance ratios the property and casualty insurance industry uses the combined ratio as a measure of underwriting profitability 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the loss ratio is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums 
the expense ratio  when calculated on a statutory accounting basis  is the ratio of underwriting expenses to net written premiums 
the expense ratio  when calculated on a gaap basis  differs from the statutory method specifically as it relates to policy acquisition expenses 
policy acquisition expenses are expensed as incurred under the statutory accounting method 
however  for gaap  policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
the combined ratio reflects only underwriting results and does not include fee for service income or investment income 
underwriting profitability is subject to significant fluctuations due to competition  catastrophic events  economic and social conditions and other factors

liquidity and capital resources we are organized as a holding company with all of our operations being conducted by our insurance subsidiaries  which underwrite the risks associated with our insurance policies  and our non insurance subsidiaries  which provide our policyholders and our insurance subsidiaries a variety of services related to the insurance policies we provide 
we have continuing cash needs for taxes and administrative expenses 
these ongoing obligations are funded with dividends from our non insurance subsidiaries 
our taxes are paid by each subsidiary through an inter company tax allocation agreement 
in addition  a portion of the proceeds of our sale of common stock to our partner agents had historically been used to pay taxes 
we do not expect to sell common stock to our partner agents in the future as any purchases subsequent to the initial public offering have been and will continue to be made in the open market 
proformance s primary sources of funds are premiums received  investment income and proceeds from the sale and redemption of investment securities 
our non insurance subsidiaries primary source of funds is policy service revenues 
our subsidiaries use funds to pay operating expenses  make payments under the tax allocation agreement  and pay dividends to us 
in addition  proformance uses funds to pay claims and purchase investments 
we have historically received much of our capital in connection with replacement carrier transactions 
as discussed more fully in the overview section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we cannot be certain that replacement carrier transactions on acceptable terms will continue to be available to us 
if we are unable to enter into replacement carrier transactions on acceptable terms in the future  we may be forced to seek other sources of capital including the issuance in either a public offering or a private placement of common stock or other equity or debt securities  which sources could be unavailable to us  or if available  could be more costly to us 
on april   an initial public offering of  shares of the company s common stock after the for stock split was completed 
the company sold  shares resulting in net proceeds to the company after deducting issuance costs and the underwriters discount of  the company contributed  to proformance  which increased its statutory surplus 
the additional capital will permit the company to reduce its reinsurance purchases and to retain more of the direct written premiums produced by its partner agents 
on may   the company contributed an additional  to proformance  thereby further increasing its statutory surplus 
the remainder of the capital raised will be used for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to possible additional increases to the capitalization of the existing subsidiaries 
for the years ended december   and  our consolidated cash flows provided by operations was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operations for the year ended december  as compared to december  was due primarily to the a decrease in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  partially offset by a decrease in reinsurance recoverables and receivables and increases in unearned premiums and income taxes payable 
for the year ended december   unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased million as compared with an increase of million for the same period in reinsurance recoverables and receivables for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to an increase of million for the same period in the decrease in cash flows provided by operations for the year ended december  as compared to december  was due primarily to the conversion of six month to twelve month policies and the related increases on premiums receivable and the deferred acquisition cost asset 
accrued interest income also increased during the period as a result of the increase in fixed income securities 
for the years ended december   and  our consolidated cash flow used for investing activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year is related primarily due to the conversion of our private passenger automobile business from six month to twelve month policies which began on january  this conversion process led to an increase in premium writings for the year ended december   which was subsequently invested by the company along with the continued investment of the capital received as part of the initial public offering which was completed on april  direct written premiums for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million in the comparable period 
in addition  for the year ended december  our consolidated cash flow used in investing activities was in excess of our cash provided by operations as proformance invested the million which was contributed by national atlantic holdings during the period 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was consistent with the same period in the prior year as the capital received in connection with the company s initial public offering which was completed on april  was used to purchase additional investments 
for the years ended december   and  our consolidated cash flow used in provided by financing activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in our consolidated cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  is related to the repurchase of capital stock as authorized by the board of directors on july  as well as the capital received during in connection with the company s initial public offering which was completed on april  the increase in our consolidated cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is directly related to the capital received in connection with the company s initial public offering  which was completed on april  the effective duration of our investment portfolio was years as of december  by contrast  our liability duration was approximately years as of december  we do not believe this difference in duration adversely affects our ability to meet our current obligations because we believe our cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet those obligations 
pursuant to our tax planning strategy  we invested the million received from the ocic replacement carrier transaction in long term bonds in accordance with treasury ruling regulation  which allows us to defer the payment of income taxes on the associated replacement carrier revenue until the underlying securities are either sold or mature 
the effective duration of our investment portfolio  when excluding these securities  is reduced from years to years 
management believes that the current level of cash flow from operations provides us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs over the next months 
we expect to be able to continue to meet our operating needs after the next months from internally generated funds 
since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term beyond such month period is dependent upon such factors as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs 
there are no restrictions on the payment of dividends by our non insurance subsidiaries other than customary state corporation laws regarding solvency 
dividends from proformance are subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus and earnings 
proformance may not make an extraordinary dividend until days after the commissioner of the njdobi which we refer to as the commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected or has approved it in such time 
an extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution whose fair market value together with that of other distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the greater of of the insurer s surplus as of the preceding december  or the insurer s net income excluding realized capital gains for the twelve month period ending on the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
under new jersey law  an insurer may pay dividends that are not considered extraordinary only from its unassigned funds  also known as its earned surplus 
the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs following payment of any dividend or distribution to stockholders 
as of december   proformance is permitted to pay dividends without the approval of the commissioner 
proformance has not paid any dividends in the past and we do not anticipate that proformance will pay dividends in the foreseeable future because we wish to reduce our reinsurance purchases in order to retain more of the gross premiums written we generate 
we also seek stronger financial strength ratings for proformance  and both of these objectives require that the capital of proformance be increased 
in addition  the payment of dividends and other distributions by mayfair is regulated by bermuda insurance law and regulations 
the table below sets forth the aggregate amount of dividends paid to us by our non insurance subsidiaries during the years ended december   and naia riverview because our non insurance subsidiaries generate revenues  profits and net cash flows that are generally unrestricted as to their availability for the payment of dividends  we expect to use those revenues to service all of our corporate financial obligations  such as shareholder dividends  if declared 
the percentage of our total revenues generated by our non insurance subsidiaries for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the company has entered into a seven year lease agreement for the use of office space and equipment 
the most significant obligation under the lease terms other than the base rent are the reimbursements of the company s share of the operating expenses of the premises  which include real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  utilities  and insurance 
net rent expense for  and was   and  respectively 
the company entered into a four year lease agreement for the use of additional office space and equipment commencing on september  rent expense for  and was   and  respectively 
aggregate minimum rental commitments of the company as of december  are as follows year amount and thereafter total in connection with the lease agreement  the company obtained a letter of credit in the amount of  as security for payment of the base rent 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
proformance s historic trends of net paid losses compared to net premiums collected for calendar years  and reflect ratios of  and  respectively 
each of the replacement carrier transactions with ocic  met p c and sentry insurance created an unusual influx of premium  particularly in calendar years and  causing a reduction in net paid loss ratios 
in the and calendar years in which we did not have any replacement carrier transactions  our ratio of net paid losses to net written premiums averaged 
the ratio in was due to the fact that the company s loss ratio deteriorated compared to the loss ratio  resulting in an increase in net paid losses for the same period 
the reduction in this ratio was due to increase in the influx of net written premiums as a result of the replacement carrier transactions outlined above and time lag between when the net premium was written and the actual net losses were paid in connection with that business 
as expected this ratio has returned to levels consistent with ratios achieved in and as the business written in connection with the replacement carrier transactions entered into in and has been on our books for several underwriting cycles 
we began to see this return in the latter portion of and it has continued throughout proformance s asset liability match has been established based on the average duration of its claims payments  which we estimate to be approximately years as of december  not including the invested replacement carrier revenue associated with the ocic replacement carrier transaction  the existing investment portfolio has an effective duration of years 
the long term investments associated with the ocic replacement carrier transaction million represents replacement carrier revenue received to support the premium to surplus leverage in connection with the offers of renewal to those policyholders 
the liquidation of securities to retire outstanding claim payments could affect liquidity and future income negatively 
the asset liability match of the revenue generated in the ocic replacement carrier transaction was contemplated based on the premiums to surplus leverage it was intended to support 
we do not anticipate that the payment of claims will be affected by these longer term investments based on sufficient cash flow provided from the collection of premiums and therefore we do not intend to sell any securities in such surplus funds prior to maturity 
future liquidity and operating income could be impacted if the fixed income securities are sold prior to maturity exposing them to market rate risk 
investments as of december  and december   the company maintained a high quality investment portfolio 
as of december  and december   we did not hold any securities that were not publicly traded  because our investment policy prohibits us from purchasing those securities 
in addition  at those dates  we did not have any non investment grade fixed income securities

as more fully described above under critical accounting policies investment accounting policy impairment  in accordance with the guidance of paragraph of sfas  should an other than temporary impairment be determined  we recognize such loss on the income statement and we write down the value of the security and treat the adjusted value as the new cost basis of the security 
our gross unrealized losses represented of cost or amortized cost of the investment portfolio as of december  fixed maturities represented of the investment portfolio and of the unrealized losses as of december  there are three equity and one preferred security having an unrealized loss of  a fair value of  and an amortized cost of  as of december   which has been in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than months 
there is one equity and one preferred security having an unrealized loss of  a fair value of  and an amortized cost of  as of december   which has been in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than months 
there were three hundred and twenty six fixed maturity securities having an unrealized loss of  a fair value of  and an amortized cost of  as of december   which have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than months 
there were ninety six fixed maturity securities having an unrealized loss of  a fair value of  and an amortized cost of  as of december   which have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than months 
our fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position have an average aa credit rating by moody s  with extended maturity dates  which have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates after the purchase date 
as part of our ongoing security monitoring process by our investment manager and investment committee  it was concluded that no securities in the portfolio were considered to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  we believe  with the investment committee s confirmation  that securities that are temporarily impaired that continue to pay principal and interest in accordance with their contractual terms  will continue to do so 
management considers a number of factors when selling securities 
for fixed income securities  management considers realizing a loss if the interest payments are not made on schedule or the credit quality has deteriorated 
management also considers selling a fixed income security in order to increase liquidity 
management considers selling an equity security at a loss if it believes that the fundamentals  i 
e  earnings growth  earnings guidance  prospects of dividends  and management quality have deteriorated 
management considers selling equity securities at a gain for liquidity purposes 
our investment manager is restricted with respect to the sales of all securities in an unrealized loss position 
these transactions require the review and approval by senior management prior to execution 
we review our unrealized gains and losses on at least a quarterly basis to determine if the investments are in compliance with our interest rate forecast and the equity modeling process 
specifically  in the current economic environment  we would consider selling securities if we can reallocate the sales proceeds to more suitable investments as it relates to either our interest rate forecast or equity model 
in addition  we conduct a sensitivity analysis of our fixed income portfolio on at least a quarterly basis to determine the market value impact on our fixed income portfolio of an increase or decrease in interest rates of 
based on this analysis  we will continue to hold securities in an unrealized gain or loss position if the payments of principal and interest are not delinquent and are being made consistent with the investment s repayment schedule 
the related impact on the investment portfolio is realized should we decide to sell a particular investment at either a gain or a loss 
furthermore  if we believe that the yield to maturity determined by the price of the fixed income security can be attained or exceeded by an alternative investment that decreases our interest rate risk and or duration  we may sell the fixed income security 
this may initially increase or decrease our investment income and allow us to reallocate the proceeds to other investments 
our decision to purchase and sell investments is also dependent upon the economic conditions at a particular point in time 
our policy states that if the fair value of a security is less than the amortized cost  the security will be considered impaired 
for investments classified as available for sale  we need to consider writing down the investment to its fair value if the impairment is considered other than temporary 
if a security is considered other than temporarily impaired pursuant to this policy  the cost basis of the individual security will be written down to the current fair value 
the amount of the write down will be calculated as the difference between cost and fair value and accounted for as a realized loss for accounting purposes which negatively impacts future earnings 
as of december  and as of december   our fixed income portfolio was and and respectively  concentrated in us government securities and securities of government agencies and authorities that carry an aaa rating from moody s  respectively 
there were no securities that were considered other than temporarily impaired as of december  there were no securities that were considered other than temporarily impaired as of december  the following summarizes our unrealized losses by designated category as of december  securities in an unrealized loss position for less than months of amortized fair unrealized unrealized cost value losses loss investment grade fixed income equities securities in an unrealized loss position for to months of amortized fair unrealized unrealized cost value losses loss investment grade fixed income equities securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than months of amortized fair unrealized unrealized cost value losses loss investment grade fixed income equities securities with a decline in fair value below carrying values less than of amortized fair unrealized unrealized cost value losses loss investment grade fixed income equities securities with a decline in fair value below carrying values of of amortized fair unrealized unrealized cost value losses loss investment grade fixed income equities securities with a decline in fair value below carrying values greater than of amortized fair unrealized unrealized cost value losses loss investment grade fixed income equities contractual obligations the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations and credit related commitments as of december  contractual obligations and credit related commitments less than more than year years years years total loss and loss adjustment expenses operating lease obligations as of december  we had property and casualty reserves of million 
the amounts and timing of these obligations are not set contractually 
nonetheless  based on cumulative property and casualty claims paid over the last ten years  we anticipate that approximately will be paid within a year  an additional between one and three years  between three and five years and in more than five years 
while we believe that historical performance of loss payment patterns is a reasonable source for projecting future claim payments  there is inherent uncertainty in this payment estimate because of the potential impact from changes in the legal environment whereby court decisions and changes in backlogs in the court system could influence claim payout patterns 
our mix of business because property and first party claims settle more quickly than bodily injury claims 
claims staffing levels claims may be settled at a different rate based on the future staffing levels of the claim department 
reinsurance programs changes in proformance s retention will influence the payout of the liabilities 
as proformance s net retention increases  the liabilities will take longer to settle than in past years 
loss cost trends increases decreases in inflationary factors legal and economic will influence ultimate claim payouts and their timing
