explanatory note regarding restatement this annual report on form k for the year ended december  includes the effects of a restatement on the following previously issued consolidated financial statements  data and related disclosures i our audited consolidated financial statements as of december  and for each of the two years in the period ended december   ii our selected financial data as of and for the years ended december    and  and iii our unaudited quarterly financial data for the first quarter in the year ended december  and for all quarters in the year ended december  financial information included in our reports on form k and form q filed prior to july   and the related opinions of our independent registered public accounting firms  and all earnings press releases and similar communications and all financial information included in our reports on form k issued by us prior to december   should not be relied upon and are superseded in their entirety by this annual report on form k and other reports on form q and form k filed by us with the sec on or after december  we became aware of potential issues with respect to our historical stock option grants in may after the center for financial research and analysis cfra released a report titled options backdating which companies are at risk this report concluded there was a high probability that we backdated option grants from to  based on stock price trends around certain grant dates 
upon becoming aware of the cfra report  management immediately commenced a voluntary internal review involving the examination of certain stock option grants 
in may  management notified our board of directors that an internal review was in process in response to the analysis in the cfra report 
during our initial review  management discovered irregularities in certain historical stock option grants and discussed these findings with the board of directors in late may we learned during the course of the initial review  and through subsequent discussions between our former general counsel and certain directors  of irregularities regarding the pricing of a grant to our former general counsel 
upon review of the findings of the internal review and subsequent to such discussions  the board of directors immediately terminated the employment of our former general counsel for cause 
the board of directors created a committee the special committee comprised of certain of its members who were independent of our company and management and who had not previously served as members of our board s compensation committee to conduct an investigation to evaluate the conduct and performance of our officers  employees and directors who were involved in the option granting process and to evaluate the timing of option grants  the related approval documentation and accounting implications with respect to grants made during the period from january  through march  in may  the special committee retained independent counsel and forensic accountants to assist in the investigation collectively referred to as the investigative team 
no limits were placed on the scope of the investigation 
independent counsel first met with the audit committee and with the special committee in june the special committee held more than meetings from june  through the date of this filing to discuss matters related to the investigation with its advisors 
the investigation included interviews with over individuals  which were conducted at the direction of the investigative team 
more than million emails and electronic documents were collected  of which approximately  were determined to be relevant to the investigation and reviewed 
in addition  more than boxes of documents were reviewed 
findings and conclusions the special committee presented its initial findings to the board of directors on october  as part of this presentation  the special committee communicated to our board of directors information concerning errors and irregularities with respect to our option granting practices  including  among others  the new hire option grant of our former president and one of the option grants to our former general counsel 
immediately following that 
table of contents presentation  our chairman and chief executive officer retired and our president was terminated 
the board determined this termination was a termination for cause 
the special committee investigation was completed in november the special committee concluded that there were both qualitative issues and accounting and administrative errors relating to our stock option granting process 
in this regard  the special committee concluded that certain former members of management had acted inappropriately  giving rise to qualitative concerns 
the qualitative concerns included the following in the case of our former general counsel  he and a former member of management participated in intentionally modifying one of the former general counsel s stock option grants so as to create a lower exercise price  and the former general counsel failed to disclose this unauthorized change to the board of directors prior to late may  in some instances  former members of management drafted corporate records  including employment documentation  board and compensation committee meeting minutes and actions by unanimous written consent  with the benefit of hindsight so as to choose measurement dates giving more favorable exercise prices  moreover  certain of these documents were used by us in making accounting determinations with respect to stock based compensation  during the course of the investigation  certain former members of management did not provide completely accurate or consistent information and in one case  provided documentation to the special committee that the special committee determined was intentionally altered  and certain former members of senior management did not display the appropriate oversight and tone at the top expected by the board of directors 
in addition to the foregoing  the special committee concluded that certain stock option awards were previously accounted for using incorrect measurement dates because i we had previously determined accounting measurement dates for certain stock option awards incorrectly  and  in some instances  such dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight so as to intentionally  and not inadvertently or as a result of administrative error  give more favorable exercise prices  ii the key terms for a substantial portion of the grants in an annual merit grant had been determined with finality prior to the original measurement date  with a reduction in the exercise price on the original measurement date  which represented a repricing  iii original accounting measurement dates occurred prior to approval dates  iv original accounting measurement dates occurred prior to employment commencement dates  v approval and employment commencement date documentation was incorrect or inconsistent and vi certain director grants contained clerical errors 
as a result of these findings  we have restated our consolidated financial statements to properly reflect the correction of these errors 
during this restatement  we also corrected other known errors 
to correct our past accounting for stock options under accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb  we recorded additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense totaling million  including of million million  net of tax for the year ended december   million million  net of tax for the year ended december  and million million  net of tax for the periods through we also expect to amortize less than million of such pre tax charges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment sfas r  in periods from january  through 
table of contents the following table presents stock based compensation expense recorded in this restatement by type of error as discussed below in thousands total reason for revised accounting measurement date annual merit grant allocation and or approval not complete on the original measurement date original accounting measurement date prior to approval date original accounting measurement date prior to employment commencement date incorrect or inconsistent approval and employment commencement date documentation clerical errors in director grants total of intrinsic charges for revised measurement dates repriced annual merit grant post employment option modifications previously not recorded correction of accounting errors  primarily options historically accounted for as variable awards total option grants previously accounted for using incorrect measurement dates the special committee identified instances of the following annual merit grant allocation and or approval not complete on the original measurement date  original accounting measurement date prior to approval date  original accounting measurement date prior to employment commencement date  incorrect or inconsistent approval and employment commencement date documentation  and clerical errors in director grants 
in light of the significant judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates  alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different stock based compensation expense than recorded by us in the restatement 
while we considered various alternative approaches  we believe that the approaches we used were the most appropriate under the circumstances 
we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how the restatement adjustments described in this annual report on form k could have changed under alternative methodologies for determining measurement dates for stock option grants from through see critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of the annual report on form k for information regarding the incremental stock based compensation charges that would result from using alternate measurement dates 
approximately of the total intrinsic value the stock price on the revised measurement date minus the exercise price recognized as a result of the investigation results from option grants made during the period through with the exception of a few individuals who are no longer associated with mcafee  we believe all holders of incorrectly priced options issued by us were not involved in or aware of the improper dating of options or other errors 
accordingly  we plan to continue to honor the options that violated the terms of our stock option plans  except in certain isolated cases described in the section modifications in to certain stock options granted to former executive officers and current directors in note  employee stock benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements 
the special committee and management determined that the measurement dates for grants made after april complied with the prevailing accounting pronouncements and are not subject to restatement 
the special committee proposed a number of remedial measures arising out of its investigation intended to enhance existing internal controls  policies and procedures relating to our stock option granting processes 
since november  all 
table of contents grants have been approved at regularly scheduled compensation committee meetings which have been documented in compensation committee minutes 
repriced annual merit grant the annual merit grant consisted of million options which had an original measurement date of april  we determined that the key terms were determined with finality for approximately million of these options in march  and that the exercise price was reduced to on april  the reduction in the exercise price was considered a repricing  therefore  we have accounted for these options as variable awards in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
post employment option modifications previously not recorded during the course of the investigation  we identified modifications to the key terms of certain stock option awards which had not been accounted for previously 
these modifications occurred upon the termination of an employee and  in some cases  provided for the extension of the post termination time period in which options could be exercised and allowed for the continued vesting of options subsequent to the former employee s termination date 
to the extent the terminated employee was not expected to perform substantive services on our behalf after termination  we should have recorded stock based compensation expense based on the intrinsic value of the options on the date of the modification 
to the extent the terminated employee was expected to continue to perform services on our behalf after termination or the modification occurred after the employee terminated  we should have recognized stock based compensation expense based upon the fair value of the options received by the non employee during the period in which services were provided 
we did not properly account for the stock based compensation expenses associated with certain option modifications in our previously issued financial statements 
to correct our past accounting for stock option modifications  we recorded additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense in the amount of million and million in and periods prior to  respectively 
we had no adjustments related to post employment modifications in certain of the post employment modifications also resulted in cash payments to former employees subsequent to their termination date 
we should have recorded cash based compensation expense on the termination date for the amount of the cash payments made subsequent to the termination date 
in our previously issued financial statements  we incorrectly accounted for post termination cash payments in the periods in which the payments were made 
to correct our past accounting for these post termination payments  we recorded adjustments to cash compensation expense which effectively shifted previously recorded compensation expense into the proper periods 
these adjustments did not affect we recorded additional cash based compensation benefit totaling million during and additional cash based compensation expense totaling million in periods prior to correction of errors  primarily options historically accounted for as variable awards additionally  we discovered certain errors in our accounting for stock options that were repriced and historically accounted for as variable awards 
these errors consisted primarily of an error in applying the transition guidance provided in fin to correct these errors in accounting for variable awards  we recorded additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense in the amount of million  million and million in  in and periods prior to  respectively 
we recorded additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense in the amount of million in periods prior to related to other corrections of errors 
income tax implications exist as a result of the revision of stock option measurement dates as a result of our determination that certain of our measurement dates were not determined appropriately  we also reviewed our stock option grants to assess any related tax implications 
section m of the internal revenue code section m prohibits tax deductions for non performance based compensation paid to the chief executive officer and the four highest compensated officers in excess of million in a taxable year 
compensation attributable to stock options issued under our employee stock option plan meets the requirements for treatment as qualified performance based compensation and is an exception from the deduction limit of 
table of contents section m provided the exercise price is greater than or equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
during our internal review of historical stock option granting practices  we determined that certain tax deductions related to stock options exercised by certain employees are not allowed under section m because the exercise price of the stock option was less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  we reduced the additional paid in capital balances by million  million and million from amounts previously reported in  and periods prior to  respectively  with corresponding adjustments to certain deferred tax assets and income taxes payable 
in addition  we recorded million  less than million and million of expense in  and periods prior to  respectively  related to international tax implications as a result of revising stock option measurement dates 
other prior period errors this restatement of prior period financial statements also includes corrections of other errors 
we have corrected these errors in the appropriate accounting period with the restatement of our financial statements for the non cash stock based compensation expense discussed above 
the aggregate effect on net income was a decrease in income of million in an increase of million in and an increase of million in periods prior to other issues in addition to the charges resulting from the correction of the errors determined pursuant to the investigation  we expect additional expenses in future periods associated with our strategy to mitigate employee income tax implications for those individuals with options affected by revised measurement dates and we have taken certain actions and are considering other actions to modify certain option agreements to compensate those former employees who were unable to exercise options during the blackout period  the period from july  when we announced that we might have to restate our historical financial statements as a result of our ongoing stock option investigation  through the date we become current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
section a we also reviewed the consequences of issuing in the money grants under section a of the internal revenue code 
we are considering offering active employees who are option holders the opportunity to amend or exchange their options to avoid the adverse tax consequences of section a 
blackout period from july  when we announced that we might have to restate our historical financial statements as a result of our ongoing stock option investigation  through the date we become current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  we have not been able to issue any shares  including those pursuant to stock option exercises 
in january  we extended the post termination exercise period for all vested options held by certain former employees and outside directors that would expire during the blackout period until the earlier of i the ninetieth calendar day after we become current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  ii the expiration of the contractual terms of the options  or iii december  as a result of the modifications  we recognized million of stock based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of based on the fair value of these modified options 
based on the guidance in sfas r and related fasb staff positions  after the january modification  stock options held by former employees and outside directors that terminated prior to such modification became subject to the provisions of eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf 
as a result  in january  these options were reclassified as liability awards within current liabilities 
accordingly  at the end of each reporting period  we will determine the fair value of these options utilizing the black scholes valuation model and recognize any change in fair value of the options in our consolidated statements of income in the period of change until the options are 
table of contents exercised  expire or are otherwise settled 
the expense or benefit associated with these options will be included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income  and will not be reflected as stock based compensation expense 
we will record expense or benefit in future periods based on the closing price of our common stock 
in november  due to a delay in our becoming current in our reporting obligations  we extended the post termination exercise period for options held by former employees and outside directors who terminated subsequent to the january modification and those previously modified in january as discussed above  until the earlier of i the ninetieth calendar day after we become current in our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  ii the expiration of the contractual terms of the options  or iii december  based on the guidance in sfas r and related fasb staff positions  after the november modification  stock options held by the former employees and outside directors that terminated subsequent to the january modification and prior to november became subject to the provisions of eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
as a result  in november  these options will be reclassified as liability awards within current liabilities

com  supports marketing activities to our key customer and prospect segments  including home and home office users  small and medium sized businesses  large enterprises and our partner community 
our website contains various marketing materials and information about our products 
our customers can download and purchase some products directly online 
we also promote our products and services through advertising activities in trade publications  direct mail campaigns  television and strategic arrangements  as well as online through key word and search based advertising 
in addition  we attend trade shows  industry conferences  and publish periodic channel and customer newsletters 
we also market our products through the use of rebate programs and marketing funds 
within most countries  we typically offer volume incentive rebates to strategic channel partners and promotional rebates to end users 
our strategic channel partners may earn a volume incentive rebate primarily based upon their sale of our products to end users 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid changes in technology 
we also expect competition to continue to increase in the near term 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products include  but are not limited to performance  quality  accuracy  breadth of product group  integration of products  introduction of new products and features  brand name recognition  price  market presence  functionality  innovation  
table of contents customer support  frequency of upgrades and updates  reduction of production costs  usability and technical support  manageability of products and reputation 
we believe that we compete favorably against our competitors in many of these areas 
however  some of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  stronger relationships with strategic channel partners  larger technical staffs  established relationships with hardware vendors and or greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and other advantages 
these factors may provide our competitors with an advantage in penetrating markets with their security and management products 
system protection market 
our principal competitors in the anti virus market are symantec corp  ca  inc  and microsoft corporation 
trend micro inc remains the strongest competitor in the asian anti virus market and has entered the us and emea markets 
kaspersky lab  inc  panda software  sophos  f secure corporation and dr 
ahn s anti virus lab are also competitors in their respective markets 
network protection market 
our principal competitors in the network protection market are cisco systems inc  ca  inc  ibm which acquired internet security systems in october  juniper networks  inc  symantec corp  check point software technologies ltd 
and com corporation 
ibm  qualys and ncircle are the strongest competitors for our foundstone products and solutions 
web security market 
our principal competitors in the web security market  which includes our siteadvisor products  include microsoft corporation  trend micro  inc and various search engine providers  namely google  inc and yahoo  inc 
in addition  we anticipate that symantec corporation may enter this market in the near future 
other competitors 
in addition to competition from large technology companies such as hewlett packard co  ibm  novell inc and microsoft corporation  we also face competition from smaller companies and shareware authors that may develop competing products 
our proprietary technology our success depends significantly upon proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets and copyrights to establish and protect proprietary rights to our software 
however  these protections may be inadequate or competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
often  we do not obtain signed license agreements from customers who license products from us 
in these cases  we include an electronic version of an end user license in all of our electronically distributed software and a printed license in the box for our products 
since none of these licenses are signed by the licensee  many legal authorities believe that such licenses may not be enforceable under the laws of many states and foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect these rights at all or offer only limited protection for these rights 
the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary software technology may be inadequate to deter misuse or theft of this technology 
for example  we are aware that a substantial number of users of our anti virus products have not paid any license or support fees to us 
our employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals worldwide 
less than of our employees are represented by a labor union 
competition for qualified management and technical personnel is intense in the software industry 
our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
to date  we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees  but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and could result in a complete loss of your investment 
we are subject to intense competition and we expect to face increased competition in the future 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and we expect both product and pricing competition to increase 
if our competitors gain market share in the markets for our products  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
as competition increases  we expect increases in our product related expenses  including increased product rebates  funds provided to our partners for marketing and strategic channel partner revenue sharing agreements 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  have more extensive international operations  greater name recognition  larger technical staffs  established relationships with hardware vendors and or greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our principal competitors in specific product markets include  but are not limited to in the system protection market  which includes our anti virus and anti spyware solutions  symantec corporation  ca  inc and microsoft corporation 
trend micro inc remains the strongest competitor in the asian anti virus market and has entered the north american and emea markets 
kaspersky lab  inc  panda software  sophos  f secure corporation  and dr 
ahn s anti virus lab are also competitors in their respective geographic markets  in the network protection market  which includes our other intrusion detection and protection products  cisco systems inc  ca  inc  ibm  which acquired internet security systems inc 
in october  juniper networks  inc  symantec corporation and com corporation 
ibm and qualys are the strongest competitors for our intrushield and foundstone products and solutions  respectively  and in the web security market  which includes our siteadvisor products  microsoft corporation  trend micro inc  and various search engine providers  namely  google inc and yahoo inc 
in addition  we anticipate symantec corporation may enter this market in the near future 
other competitors for our various products could include large technology companies 
we also face competition from numerous smaller companies  shareware and freeware authors and open source projects that may develop competing products  as well as from future competitors  currently unknown to us  who may develop competing products or enter into our product markets 
a significant portion of our revenue comes from our consumer business 
we focus on growth in this segment both directly and through relationships with isps such as aol and comcast  and pc oems  such as dell  acer 
table of contents gateway and toshiba 
as competition in this market increases  we have experienced and expect continued pricing pressures from both our competitors and partners that have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our ability to sustain our revenue and market share growth 
in addition  as our consumer business becomes more dependent upon the partner model  our direct online revenue may suffer and our retail business may also continue to decline 
further  as penetration of the consumer anti virus market through the isp model increases  we expect that pricing and competitive pressures in this market will become even more acute 
increasingly  our competitors are large vendors of hardware or operating system software 
these competitors are continuously developing or incorporating system and network protection functionality into their products 
for example  in the second quarter of microsoft released its consumer security solution and continues to execute on its announced plans to boost the security functionality of its windows platform through its acquisition of managed service provider frontbridge technologies  anti virus provider sybari software  inc and anti spyware provider giant company software 
through its acquisitions of okena  inc  riverhead networks and netsolv  cisco systems inc may incorporate into its firewall and router products functionality which competes with our content filtering and anti virus products 
in addition  juniper networks  inc acquired netscreen technologies  which allows them to incorporate intrusion prevention solutions into their firewalls and routers 
the widespread inclusion of products that perform the same or similar functions as our products within computer hardware or other companies software products could reduce the perceived need for our products or render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
even if these competitors incorporated products are inferior or more limited than our products  customers may elect to accept the incorporated products rather than purchase our products 
for example  microsoft over time has sought to add security features to its operating systems that would provide functionality similar to what our products offer 
we believe that microsoft has in the past and may in the future increase such security features while at the same time making it more difficult for us to integrate our products with its operating systems 
we could be adversely affected if our customers generally believe that microsoft s integrated offerings reduce the need for our products or if they prefer products that microsoft chooses to bundle with its operating systems  as these products and the use of bundling could impair our ability to generate sales of our products to and through pc oems 
in addition  the software industry is currently undergoing consolidation as firms seek to offer more extensive suites and broader arrays of software products  as well as integrated software and hardware solutions 
this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive position 
additionally  if our competitors products are offered at significant discounts to our prices or are bundled for free  we may be unable to respond competitively  or may have to significantly reduce our prices  which could negatively impact our revenue and gross margins 
software as a service saas is becoming an increasingly important method and business models for the delivery of applications 
saas models enable software owners to offer extensible software applications to customers for their use over the internet  allowing customers to purchase and use applications and modules on a subscription basis  without the need for individual client installations or high maintenance costs 
because of the advantages that saas models offer over traditional software sales and licensing  competitors using saas models could enjoy growth in their businesses and  as a result  we could lose business to such competitors 
we face product development risks associated with rapid technological changes in our market 
the markets for our products are highly fragmented and characterized by ongoing technological developments  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements 
our success depends on our ability to timely and effectively offer a broad range of network and system protection products  enhance existing products and expand product offerings  particularly those that operate in virtual environments  extend security technologies to additional digital devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants  respond promptly to new customer requirements and industry standards  
table of contents provide frequent  low cost or free upgrades and updates for our products  maintain quality  remain compatible with popular operating systems such as linux  sun s solaris  unix  macintosh and osx  windows xp and windows nt  and develop products that are compatible with new or otherwise emerging operating systems such as microsoft s windows vista operating system and macintosh leopard  and interoperate with industry trends and new technologies and function within new operating environments  including virtual machine environments  that are or that become increasingly important to customer deployments 
we may experience delays in product development as we have at times in the past 
complex products like ours may contain undetected errors or version compatibility problems  particularly when first released  which could delay or harm market acceptance 
in addition  we may choose not to deliver a previously announced product 
the widespread inclusion of products that perform the same or similar functions as our products within the windows platform could reduce the perceived need for our products 
for example  in the second quarter of microsoft executed on its announced plans to boost the security functionality of its windows platform 
even if these incorporated products are inferior or more limited than our products  customers may elect to accept the incorporated products rather than purchase our products 
the occurrence of these events could negatively impact our business 
in addition  we must continuously work to ensure that our products meet industry certifications and standards 
failure to meet industry standards and obtain product certifications could cause us to lose customers and sales and could impact our business 
also  if we fail to recognize and adapt to industry trends which challenge traditional software licensing models  including virtualization technologies that impact how software is purchased and deployed  we may experience lower revenues as a result 
the discovery that we had retroactively priced stock options and had not accounted for them correctly may result in continued or additional litigation  regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions 
in may  we announced that we had commenced an investigation of our historical stock option granting practices 
in june  we received a document subpoena from the securities and exchange commission  or sec  related to our historical stock option granting practices 
also  around the same time  we received a notice of informal inquiry from the united states department of justice  or doj  concerning our stock option granting practices 
in this form k  we are filing restated consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and to make certain non cash  and other  adjustments as a result of our review of our historical stock option granting practices 
in addition  we are also restating our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended june   september   and march  in our form qs for the quarters ended june   september  and march   filed simultaneously with this annual report on form k 
in connection with the restatement  we recorded additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense totaling million  consisting of million million  net of tax for the year ended december   million million  net of tax for the year ended december  and million million  net of tax for the periods through the filing of our restated consolidated financial statements does not resolve the pending sec inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices 
we are engaged in ongoing discussions with  and continue to provide information to  the sec regarding certain of our prior period consolidated financial statements 
the resolution of the sec inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices could require the filing of additional restatements of our prior consolidated financial statements or require that we take other actions not presently contemplated 
as part of the remedial actions we have taken in connection with the investigation and restatement  we have terminated for cause the employment of some employees  including former executive officers 
we are the subject of litigation and similar proceedings in connection with such terminations  and we expect that we may be subject to similar actions in the future 
in addition  terminations and related actions  litigations and proceedings may require 
table of contents us to make severance  settlement or other related payments in the future  which could adversely impact our operating results 
we cannot predict the outcome of the pending government inquiries or stockholder or other lawsuits  and we may face additional government inquiries  stockholder lawsuits and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option granting practices and the remedial actions we have taken 
we cannot predict what  if any  enforcement action the sec or doj will take with respect to our failure to be current in our periodic reports or our historical stock option granting practices 
all of these events have required us  and we expect will continue to require us  to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting  legal  and other expenses and ultimately adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our international operations involve risks which could increase our expenses adversely  impact our operating results and divert the time and attention of management 
during  net revenue in our operating regions outside of north america represented approximately of our total net revenue 
we expect international revenue to remain a significant percentage of our net revenue and our continued focus on international growth exposes us to numerous risks  the impact of any of which could adversely affect our operating results 
risks related to our international operations and strategy and specific to our company include increased costs and difficulties in managing and coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed operations  particularly sales and support  located on multiple continents in greatly varying time zones and culturally diverse operations  the challenge of successfully establishing  managing and staffing shared service centers for worldwide sales finance and accounting operations centralized from locations in the us and europe  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  our ability to adapt to sales and marketing practices and customer requirements in different cultures  our ability to successfully localize software products for a significant number of international markets  compliance with more stringent consumer protection and privacy laws  currency fluctuations  including weakness of the us dollar relative to other currencies  or the strengthening of the us dollar that may have an adverse impact on revenues  financial results and cash flows  risks related to hedging strategies  potentially adverse tax consequences  including the complexities of foreign value added taxes and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  enactment of additional regulations or restrictions on the use  import or export of encryption technologies  which would delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communication  political instability in both established and emerging markets  tariffs  trade barriers and export restrictions  costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages  increased compliance and regulatory risks in established and emerging markets  a high incidence of software piracy in some countries  and international labor laws and our relationship with our employees and regional work councils 
the impact of any one or more of these risks could negatively affect our business and operating results 
generally  we are subject to a lower blended corporate tax rate on our international sales 
changes in domestic or 
table of contents international tax regulations could adversely affect this arrangement in the future and impact our ability to realize similar tax benefits 
we face a number of risks related to our product sales through intermediaries 
we sell a significant amount of our products through intermediaries such as distributors  pc oems  isps and other strategic channel partners  referred to collectively as distributors 
our top ten distributors typically represent approximately to of our net sales in any quarter 
we expect that this percentage will increase as we continue to focus our sales efforts through our channel partners and other partners 
our two largest distributors  ingram micro inc and tech data corporation  together accounted for approximately of our net revenue during uncertain timing and delivery of products we may be unable to determine and unable to control the timing of the delivery of our products to end users by our distributors  which may make it difficult for us to forecast our revenue with respect to product sales through these intermediaries 
our reseller and oem partners are not subject to any minimum sales volumes with respect to our products and  as such  the revenue attributable to sales from these distributors is uncertain and may vary significantly from period to period  affecting our operating results 
volume of product shipped by our oem partners depends on volumes of the oem partners products shipped  which is generally outside of our control 
sale of competing products our distributors and resellers may sell other vendors products that are complementary to  or compete with  our products 
while we have instituted programs designed to motivate our distributors and resellers to focus on our products  these distributors may give greater priority to products of other suppliers  including competitors 
our ability to meaningfully increase the amount of our products sold through our distributors and resellers depends on our ability to adequately and efficiently support these partners with  among other things  appropriate financial incentives to encourage pre sales investment and sales tools  such as online sales and technical training and product collateral needed to support their customers and prospects 
any failure to properly and efficiently support our partners in this manner may result in them focusing more on our competitors products rather than our products and lost sales opportunities 
loss of a distributor the agreements we have with our distributors  including those we have with ingram micro inc and tech data corporation  are generally terminable by either party without cause with no or minimal notice or penalties 
we may expend significant time  money and resources to further relationships with our distributors that are thereafter terminated 
if one of our significant distributors terminated its agreement with us  we could experience a significant interruption in the distribution of our products 
in addition  our business interests and those of our distributors may diverge over time  which could result in conflict  and termination of  or a reduction in  collaboration 
in the past  our acquisition activity has resulted in the termination of distributor relationships 
future acquisition activity could cause similar termination of  or disruption in  our distributor relationships  which could adversely impact our revenues 
payment difficulties some of our distributors may experience financial difficulties  which could adversely impact our collection of accounts receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million as of december  we regularly review the collectability and credit worthiness of our distributors to determine an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
our uncollectible accounts could exceed our current or future allowances 
pricing competition increased competition in the markets in which we operate  particularly in connection with bids for pc oem business  has led to increased pricing pressures 
in the event that any of our pc oem partners or other distributors 
table of contents terminates their relationship with us  our revenues could decline and our business may be harmed 
further  to the extent that any of our pc oem partners or other distributors renegotiates its arrangement with us on less favorable terms  our operating results could be harmed 
we face risks associated with past and future acquisitions 
we may buy or make investments in complementary companies  products and technologies 
for example  in october we acquired foundstone to bolster our risk assessment and vulnerability management capabilities and in june we acquired wireless security corporation to continue to develop their patent pending technology to introduce a new consumer wireless security offering  and to integrate the technology into our small business managed solution 
in addition  we acquired siteadvisor in april  preventsys in june  onigma ltd 
in october and substantially all of the assets of citadel security software inc in december in november we acquired safeboot  and we expect to close our acquisition of scanalert in january we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 
future acquisitions could result in significant acquisition related charges and dilution to our stockholders 
we face a number of risks relating to our acquisitions  including the following  any of which could harm our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our past or future acquisitions 
integration integration of an acquired company or technology is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
the successful integration of an acquisition requires  among other things  that we integrate and retain key management  sales  research and development and other personnel  integrate the acquired products into our product offerings both from an engineering and sales and marketing perspective  integrate and support preexisting supplier  distribution and customer relationships  coordinate research and development efforts  and consolidate duplicate facilities and functions and integrate back office accounting  order processing and support functions 
the geographic distance between the companies  the complexity of the technologies and operations being integrated and the disparate corporate cultures being combined may increase the difficulties of integrating an acquired company or technology 
management s focus on the integration of operations may distract attention from our day to day business and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
in addition  it is common in the technology industry for aggressive competitors to attract customers and recruit key employees away from companies during the integration phase of an acquisition 
if integration of our acquired businesses or assets is not successful  we may experience adverse financial or competitive effects which we currently do not anticipate 
internal controls  policies and procedures acquired companies or businesses are likely to have different standards  controls  contracts  procedures and policies  making it more difficult to implement and harmonize company wide financial  accounting  billing  information and other systems 
this risk is amplified by the increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
open source software despite having conducted the appropriate due diligence prior to the consummation of an acquisition  products or technologies acquired by us may nonetheless include so called open source software which was not identified during the initial due diligence 
open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge  but imposes on the user of the open source software certain requirements to license to others both the open source software as well as the software that relates to  or interacts with  the open source software 
our ability to commercialize 
table of contents products or technologies incorporating open source software or otherwise fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such acquisition may be restricted because  among other reasons open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated or uncertain obligations regarding our products  and it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
use of cash and securities our available cash and securities may be used to acquire or invest in companies or products 
for example  in november  we used approximately million to acquire safeboot  bv  and in january  we expect to close the acquisition of scanalert  inc  in which we will use approximately million 
in december  we used approximately million to acquire substantially all of the assets of citadel security software inc and in october  we used approximately million to acquire onigma  ltd 
in june  we used approximately million to acquire preventsys  inc  in april we used approximately million to acquire siteadvisor  inc and in june  we used approximately million to acquire wireless security corporation 
moreover  if we acquire a company  we may have to incur or assume that company s liabilities  including liabilities that may not be fully known at the time of acquisition 
accounting charges acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses  write off of in process research and development  future impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation expense  any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
critical personnel may be difficult to attract  assimilate and retain 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain senior management personnel  as well as technically qualified and highly skilled sales  consulting  technical  finance and marketing personnel 
other than executive management who have at will employment agreements  our employees are not typically subject to an employment agreement or non competition agreement 
in the recent past we have experienced significant turnover in our senior management team and in our worldwide sales and finance organization and replacing this personnel remains difficult 
once we become current in our reporting obligations and our registration statements on form s are declared effective with respect to shares of common stock underlying our stock option plans and outstanding stock option awards  we expect some increase in short term attrition rates as employees are able exercise stock options which they have been unable to exercise as a result of our aforementioned blackout period on stock option exercises 
it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to replace any key management member or other critical personnel 
integrating new management and other key personnel also may be difficult and costly 
changes in management or other critical personnel may be disruptive to our business and might also result in our loss of unique skills and the departure of existing employees and or customers 
it may take significant time to locate  retain and integrate qualified management personnel 
other personnel related issues that we may encounter include competition for personnel  need for competitive pay packages competition for qualified individuals in our industry is intense 
to attract and retain critical personnel  we believe that we must maintain an open and collaborative work environment 
we also believe we need to provide a competitive compensation package  including stock options and restricted stock 
increases in shares available for issuance under our stock option plans require stockholder approval 
institutional stockholders  or our other stockholders  may not approve future requests for increases in shares available under our equity incentive plans 
for example  at our annual meeting held in december  our stockholders did not approve a proposed increase in shares available for grant under our employee stock option plans 
additionally  as of january   we are required to include compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 
table of contents relating to the issuance of employee stock options 
we are currently evaluating our compensation programs and in particular our equity compensation philosophy 
in the future  we may decide to issue fewer stock options  possibly impairing our ability to attract and retain necessary personnel 
conversely  issuing a comparable number of stock options could adversely impact our results of operations when compared with periods prior to the effective date of these new rules 
reduced productivity of new hires  senior management changes we continue to hire in key areas and have added a number of new employees in connection with our acquisitions 
we have also increased our hiring in bangalore  india in connection with the relocation of a significant portion of our research and development operations to india 
during and  we experienced significant change in our senior management team and we may continue to experience such changes 
our former general counsel was terminated for cause in may  our former president was terminated in october  our former chief executive officer  george samenuk  retired in october  and for a significant period during and several other key senior management positions were vacant 
the board determined the termination of our former president was for cause 
in march  we announced the appointment of david dewalt as our chief executive officer and president  effective april  who replaced dale fuller  who served as our interim chief executive officer and president from october to april most recently  in september  we announced the appointment of mark cochran as our general counsel  and in october  we announced the appointment of michael decesare as our executive vice president of worldwide sales operations 
for new employees or changes in senior management  there may be reduced levels of productivity as recent additions or hires are trained or otherwise assimilate and adapt to our organization and culture 
the significant turnover in our senior management team during and may make it difficult to attract new employees and retain existing employees 
further  this turnover may also make it difficult to execute on our business plan and achieve our planned financial results 
our financial results will likely fluctuate  making it difficult for us to accurately estimate operating results 
our revenues  gross margins and operating results have varied significantly in the past  and we expect fluctuations in our operating results to continue in the future due at least in part to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results 
our expenses are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenues  making expenses in the short term relatively fixed 
we may be unable to adjust our expenses in time to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock 
our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 
factors that may cause our revenues  gross margins and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period  include  but are not limited to the following the introduction and adoption of new products  product upgrades or updates by us or our competitors  the volume  size  timing and contractual terms of new customer licenses and renewals of existing licenses  which may influence our revenue recognition  the mix of products we sell and services we offer  including whether i our products are sold directly by us or indirectly through distributors  resellers  isps such as telefonica sa  oems such as dell  and others  ii the products are hardware or software based and iii in the case of software licenses  the licenses are perpetual licenses or time based subscription licenses  changes in our supply chains and product delivery channels  which may result in product fulfillment delays  
table of contents changes in our business strategy  increased reliance upon third party distributors  resellers and isps that are critical to the successful execution of our channel strategy  personnel limitations  which may adversely impact our ability to process the large number of orders that typically occur near the end of a fiscal quarter  costs or charges related to our acquisitions or dispositions  the components of our revenue that are deferred  including our online subscriptions and that portion of our software licenses attributable to support and maintenance  stock based compensation expense  which we began recognizing for our stock based compensation plans in the first quarter of as a result of accounting rules changes  unanticipated costs associated with litigation or investigations  costs and charges related to certain extraordinary events  including relocation of personnel and previous financial restatements  costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  changes in generally accepted accounting principles  our ability to effectively manage our operating expense levels  factors that lead to substantial declines in estimated values of long lived assets below their carrying value  and our ability to successfully address and resolve issues arising from the discovery that we had retroactively priced stock options and had not accounted for them correctly 
although a significant portion of our revenue in any quarter comes from previously deferred revenue  a meaningful part of our revenue in any quarter depends on contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  we have experienced more product orders  and hence  a higher percentage of revenue shipments  in the last month of our fiscal quarters 
some customers believe they can enhance their bargaining power by waiting until the end of our quarter to place their order 
any failure or delay in the closing of significant new orders in a given quarter could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from product sales through our distributors 
we recognize revenue on products sold by our distributors when distributors sell our products to their customers 
to determine our business performance at any point in time or for any given period  we must accurately gather sales information on a timely basis from our distributors information systems at an increased cost to us 
our distributors information systems may be less accurate or reliable than our internal systems 
we may be required to expend time and money to ensure that interfaces between our systems and our distributors systems are up to date and effective 
as our reliance upon interdependent automated computer systems continues to increase  a disruption in any one of these systems could interrupt the distribution of our products and impact our ability to accurately and timely recognize and report revenue 
further  as we increasingly rely upon third party manufacturers to manufacture our hardware based products  our reliance on their ability to provide us with timely and accurate product cost information exposes us to risk 
a failure of our third party manufacturers to provide us with timely and accurate product cost information may impact our costs of goods sold and negatively impact our ability to accurately and timely report revenue 
because we expect continued uncertainty relating to these factors  it may be difficult for us to accurately estimate operating results prior to the end of a quarter 
we face risks in connection with the material weaknesses identified by our management and any related remedial measures that we undertake 
in conjunction with i our ongoing reporting obligations as a public company and ii the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act that management report as of december  on the effectiveness of our 
table of contents internal control over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we engaged in a process to document  evaluate and test our internal controls and procedures  including corrections to existing controls and additional controls and procedures that we may implement 
as a result of this evaluation and testing process  our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to i our accounting for stock based compensation expenses related to company stock options and ii our accounting for income taxes 
in response to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to our accounting for stock based compensation expenses  we have implemented additional controls and procedures  including standardizing grant evidence and approval and standardizing grant timing 
to ensure the completeness and accuracy of all stock based compensation expense resulting from the independent investigation  we have implemented controls for accumulation and tracking of stock based compensation expense  processing and reconciliation of stock based compensation expense and independent approval and recording of stock based compensation expense 
in response to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to our accounting for income taxes  we have implemented and will continue to implement  additional controls and procedures  including enhancing the training and education of our tax accounting personnel  automating key elements of the calculation for the provision for income taxes and the account reconciliation processes by implementing a new tax accounting system and improving our interim and annual review processes for various calculations  including the tax provision computation process 
we also intend to help address material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to our accounting for income taxes by hiring more tax accounting personnel  with an emphasis on hiring personnel having international tax expertise 
these efforts have resulted  and could further result  in increased cost and could divert management attention away from operating our business 
as a result of the identified material weaknesses  even though our management believes that our efforts to remediate and re test our internal control deficiencies have resulted in the improved operation of our internal control over financial reporting  we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken or we are planning to take will sufficiently and satisfactorily remediate the identified material weaknesses 
in future periods  if the process required by section of the sarbanes oxley act reveals further material weaknesses or significant deficiencies  the correction of any such material weaknesses or significant deficiency could require additional remedial measures which could be costly and time consuming 
in addition  the discovery of further material weaknesses could also require the restatement of prior period operating results 
if a material weakness is identified as of a future period year end including a material weakness identified prior to year end for which there is an insufficient period of time to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of the corrections or related new procedures or if our previously identified material weaknesses are not remediated  our independent auditors would continue to be unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls 
this in turn  could cause us to fail to regain investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could continue to adversely affect our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation 
we may incur additional expenses in order to assist our employees with potential income tax liabilities which may arise under section a of the internal revenue code 
as a result of our investigation into our historical stock option granting practices  we have determined that a number of our outstanding stock option awards were granted at exercise prices below the fair market value of our stock on the appropriate accounting measurement date 
the primary adverse tax consequence is that the re measured options vesting after december  are potentially subject to option holder excise tax under section a of the internal revenue code and  as applicable  similar excise taxes under state law or foreign law 
our employees who hold options which are determined to have been granted with exercise prices below the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the appropriate measurement date may be subject to taxes  penalties and interest under section a if no action is taken to cure the options from exposure under section a before december  regarding potential future liabilities associated with section a  we are in the process of determining whether we will implement a plan to assist affected employees and former employees  adjust the terms of the 
table of contents original option grants  or adjust the terms of the original option grant and pay the affected employees an amount to compensate such employees for this lost benefit 
once we have determined a final course of action in these respects  if we undertake any such plan or process  we anticipate that we will record additional expenses in periods when such actions are taken 
we rely heavily on our intellectual property rights  which offer only limited protection against potential infringers  intellectual property litigation in the network and system security market is common and can be expensive 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and copyrights to establish and protect proprietary rights in our software 
however  the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary software may not deter its misuse  theft or misappropriation 
competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that inappropriately incorporate our proprietary technology 
we are aware that a number of users of our security products have not paid registration  license or subscription fees to us 
certain jurisdictions may not provide adequate legal infrastructure for effective protection of our intellectual property rights 
changing legal interpretations of liability for unauthorized use of our software or lessened sensitivity by corporate  government or institutional users to avoiding infringement of intellectual property could also harm our business 
litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect trade secrets  patents and other intellectual property rights that we own 
similarly  we may be required to defend against claimed infringement by others 
for example  as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are currently defending a patent infringement case seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against the sale of certain of our products 
in addition to the expense and distractions associated with litigation  adverse determinations could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  including monetary liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products 
the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties 
we may not prevail in these matters  or we may be unable to obtain licenses with respect to any patents or other intellectual property rights that may be held valid or infringed upon by our products or us 
if we acquire a portion of technology included in our products from third parties  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties as to the origin and ownership of any software being acquired 
similarly  notwithstanding measures taken by our competitors or us to protect our competitors intellectual property  exposure to infringement claims increases if we employ or hire software engineers previously employed by competitors 
further  to the extent we utilize open source software we face risks 
for example  the scope and requirements of the most common open source software license  the gnu general public license  or gpl  have not been interpreted in a court of law 
use of gpl software could subject certain portions of our proprietary software to the gpl requirements  which may have adverse effects on our sale of the products incorporating any such software 
other forms of open source software licensing present license compliance risks  which could result in litigation or loss of the right to use this software 
we face risks related to the strategic alliances we use to distribute our products 
through our strategic alliances  we may from time to time license technology from third parties to integrate or bundle with our products or we may license our technology for others to integrate or bundle with their products 
we 
table of contents may not realize the desired benefits from our strategic alliances on a timely basis or at all 
we face a number of risks relating to our strategic alliances  including the following strategic alliances require significant coordination between the parties involved 
to be successful  our alliances may require the integration of other companies products with our products  which may involve significant time and expenditure by our technical staff and the technical staff of our strategic allies 
our agreements relating to our strategic alliances are terminable without cause with no or minimal notice or penalties 
we may expend significant time  money and resources to further relationships with our strategic alliances that are thereafter terminated 
in addition  if we were to lose a relationship with a strategic partner  we could expend significant money in developing new strategic alliances 
the integration of products from different companies may be more difficult than we anticipate  and the risk of integration difficulties  incompatible products and undetected programming errors or defects may be higher than that normally associated with new products 
our sales force  marketing and professional services personnel may require additional training to market products that result from our strategic alliances 
the marketing of these products may require additional sales force efforts and may be more complex than the marketing of our own products 
we may be required to share ownership in technology developed as part of our strategic alliances 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and negatively impact our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenues  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts  or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
failure of our products to work properly or misuse of our products could impact sales  increase costs  and create risks of potential negative publicity and legal liability 
our products are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of complex network environments 
our products may have errors or defects that users identify after deployment  which could harm our reputation and our business 
in addition  products as complex as ours frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we have from time to time found errors in versions of our products  and we may find such errors in the future 
because customers rely on our products to manage employee behavior to protect against security risks and prevent the loss of sensitive data  any significant defects or errors in our products may result in negative publicity or legal claims 
the occurrence of errors could adversely affect sales of our products  divert the attention of engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations or legal problems 
our products may also be misused or abused by customers or non customer third parties who obtain access and use of our products 
these situations may arise where an organization uses our products in a manner that impacts their end users or employees privacy or where our products are misappropriated to censor private access to the internet 
any of these situations could result in negative press coverage and negatively affect our reputation 

table of contents we face manufacturing  supply  inventory  licensing and obsolescence risks relating to our products 
third party manufacturing we rely on a small number of third parties to manufacture some of our hardware based network protection and system protection products 
we expect the number of our hardware based products and our reliance on third party manufacturers to increase as we continue to expand our portfolio of hardware based network protection and system protection products 
reliance on third party manufacturers  including software replicators  involves a number of risks  including the lack of control over the manufacturing process and the potential absence or unavailability of adequate capacity 
if any of our third party manufacturers cannot or will not manufacture our products in required volumes on a cost effective basis  in a timely manner  at a sufficient level of quality  or at all  we will have to secure additional manufacturing capacity 
even if this additional capacity is available at commercially acceptable terms  the qualification process could be lengthy and could cause interruptions in product shipments 
the unexpected loss of any of our manufacturers would be disruptive to our business 
furthermore  supply disruptions or cost increases could increase our costs of goods sold and negatively impact our financial performance 
for example  if the price to us of our hardware based products increased and we were unable to offset the price increase  then the increased cost to us of selling the product could reduce our overall profitability 
sourcing some of our hardware products contain critical components supplied by a single or a limited number of third parties 
any significant shortage of components or the failure of the third party supplier to maintain or enhance these products could lead to cancellations of customer orders or delays in placement of orders 
third party licenses some of our products incorporate software licensed from third parties 
we must be able to obtain reasonably priced licenses and successfully integrate this software with our hardware and other software 
in addition  some of our products may include open source software 
our ability to commercialize products or technologies incorporating open source software may be restricted because  among other reasons  open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products 
obsolescence hardware based products may face greater obsolescence risks than software products 
we could incur losses or other charges in disposing of obsolete inventory 
in addition  to the extent that our third party manufacturers upgrade or otherwise alter their manufacturing processes  our hardware based products could face supply constraints or risks associated with the transition of hardware based products to new platforms  which could increase the risk of losses or other charges associated with obsolete inventory 
product fulfillment we typically fulfill delivery of our hardware based products from centralized distribution centers 
we have in the past and may in the future make changes in our product delivery network 
changes in our product delivery network may disrupt our ability to timely and efficiently meet our product delivery commitments  particularly at the end of a quarter 
as a result  we may experience increased costs in the short term as temporary delivery solutions are implemented to address unanticipated delays in product delivery 
in addition  product delivery delays may negatively impact our ability to recognize revenue if shipments are delayed at the end of a quarter 
we face risks related to customer outsourcing to system integrators 
some of our customers have outsourced the management of their information technology departments to large system integrators 
if this trend continues  our established customer relationships could be disrupted and our products could be displaced by alternative system and network protection solutions offered by system integrators that do not bundle our solutions 
significant product displacements could negatively impact our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents product liability and related claims may be asserted against us 
our products are used to protect and manage computer systems and networks that may be critical to organizations 
because of the complexity of the environments in which our products operate  an error  or a false positive  failure or defect in our products  including a security vulnerability  could disrupt or cause damage to the networks of our customers  including disruption of legitimate network traffic by our products 
for example  in march  we released a data file update that contained a defect causing certain of our products to generate false positives 
failure of our products to perform to specifications including the failure of our products to identify or block a virus  disruption of our customers network traffic or damages to our customers networks caused by our products could result in product liability damage claims by our customers 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions  particularly in circumstances involving unsigned licenses 
cryptography contained in our technology is subject to export restrictions 
some of our computer security solutions  particularly those incorporating encryption functionality  may be subject to export restrictions 
as a result  some products may not be exported to international customers without prior us government approval 
the list of products and end users for which export approval is required  and the related regulatory policies  are subject to revision by the us government at any time 
the cost of compliance with us and international export laws and changes in existing laws could affect our ability to sell certain products in certain markets and could have a material adverse effect on our international revenues 
if we fail to comply with applicable law and regulations  we may become subject to penalties and fines or restrictions that may adversely affect our business 
if we fail to effectively upgrade our information technology system  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as part of our efforts to continue improving our internal control over financial reporting  we upgraded our existing sap information technology system during in order to automate certain controls that are currently performed manually 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems and in applying maintenance patches to existing systems  including loss of data and decreases in productivity as personnel become familiar with new  upgraded or modified systems 
our management information systems will require modification and refinement as we grow and as our business needs change  which could prolong difficulties we experience with systems transitions  and we may not always employ the most effective systems for our purposes 
if we experience difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or experience significant system failures  or if we are unable to successfully modify our management information systems and respond to changes in our business needs  our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations 
we may also experience similar results if we have difficulty applying routine maintenance patches to existing systems 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 
in addition to intellectual property litigation  from time to time  we have been  and may be in the future  subject to other litigation including stockholder derivative actions or actions brought by current or former employees 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that an adverse liability resulting from such litigation is probable  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of the inherent uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
in addition to the related cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could cause the diversion of management s attention 
in this regard  we and a number of our current and former officers and directors are involved in or the subject of various legal actions 
managing  defending and indemnity obligations related to these actions have caused significant diversion of management s and the board of director s time and resulted in material expense to us 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to currently pending legal matters 

table of contents we face risks related to our settlement agreement with the securities and exchange commission 
on february   the united states district court for the northern district of california entered a final judgment permanently enjoining us and our officers and agents from future violations of the securities laws 
this final judgment resolved the charges filed against us in connection with the sec s investigation of our accounting practices that commenced in march as a result of the judgment  we will forfeit for three years the ability to invoke the safe harbor for forward looking statements provision of the private securities litigation reform act  or the reform act 
this safe harbor provided us enhanced protection from liability related to forward looking statements if the forward looking statements were either accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements or were made without actual knowledge that they were false or misleading 
while we may still rely on the bespeaks caution doctrine that existed prior to the reform act for defenses against securities lawsuits  without the statutory safe harbor  it may be more difficult for us to defend against any such claims 
in addition  due to the permanent restraint and injunction against violating applicable securities laws  any future violation of the securities laws would be a violation of a federal court order and potentially subject us to a contempt order 
for instance  if  at some point in the future  we were to discover a fact that caused us to restate our financial statements similar to the restatements that were the subject of the sec action  we could be found to have violated the final judgment 
we cannot predict whether the sec might assert that our failure to remain current in our periodic reporting obligations or our historical stock option practices violated the final judgment or what  if any  enforcement action the sec might take upon such a determination 
further  any collateral criminal or civil investigation  proceeding or litigation related to any future violation of the judgment  such as the compliance actions mandated by the judgment  could result in the distraction of management from our day to day business and may materially and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 
false detection of viruses and actual or perceived security breaches could adversely affect our business 
our system protection software products have in the past  and these products and our intrusion protection products may at times in the future  falsely detect viruses or computer threats that do not actually exist 
these false alarms  while typical in the industry  may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products 
in addition  we have in the past been subject to litigation claiming damages related to a false alarm  and similar claims may be made in the future 
an actual or perceived breach of network or computer security at one of our customers  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  could adversely affect the market s perception of our security products 
computer hackers may damage our products  services and systems 
due to our high profile in the network and system protection market  we have been a target of computer hackers who have  among other things  created viruses to sabotage or otherwise attack our products and services  including our various websites 
for example  we have seen the spread of viruses  or worms  that intentionally delete anti virus and firewall software 
similarly  hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services 
also  a number of websites have been subject to denial of service attacks  where a website is bombarded with information requests eventually causing the website to overload  resulting in a delay or disruption of service 
if successful  any of these events could damage users or our computer systems 
in addition  since we do not control disk duplication by distributors or our independent agents  disks containing our software may be infected with viruses 
we face risks related to our anti spam  anti spyware and safe search software products 
our anti spam  anti spyware and safe search products may falsely identify emails  programs or websites as unwanted spam  potentially unwanted programs or unsafe  fail to properly identify unwanted emails  programs or unsafe websites  particularly because spam emails  spyware or malware are often designed to circumvent anti spam or spyware products  or  in the case of our anti spam products  incorrectly identify legitimate businesses as users of phishing technology that seeks to gain access to personal user information 
parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our products  or whose websites are incorrectly identified as unsafe or as 
table of contents utilizing phishing techniques  may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers  spyware or unsafe  or for interfering with their business 
in addition  false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of these products 
open source software and failure to comply with open source licenses and obligations could negatively affect our business 
to the extent we utilize open source software we face risks 
for example  the scope and requirements of the most common open source software license  the gnu general public license  or gpl  have not been interpreted in a court of law 
use of gpl or other open source software could subject certain portions of our proprietary software to the gpl requirements or other similar requirements  as applicable  which may have adverse effects on our sale of the products incorporating any such software 
other forms of open source software licensing present license compliance risks  which could result in litigation or loss of the right to use this software  our ability to commercialize products or technologies incorporating open source software or otherwise fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such acquisition may be restricted because  among other reasons  open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated or uncertain obligations regarding our products 
it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
we have in place processes and controls designed to address these risks and concerns  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source  but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations 
if we fail to comply with any present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities  the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of our products 
in addition  such regulations could require us to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations  including expenses associated with the redesign of any non compliant product 
from time to time new regulations are enacted  and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced 
for example  the european union recently effected the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive rohs and the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee 
similar legislation is currently in force or is being considered in the united states  as well as other countries  such as japan and china 
the failure to comply with any of such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in us being liable for costs  fines  penalties and third party claims  and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the jurisdictions where these regulations apply 
our tax strategy may expose us to risk 
we are generally required to account for taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process may require us to make assumptions  interpretations and judgments with respect to the meaning and application of promulgated tax laws and related administrative and judicial interpretations thereof of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the positions that we take and our interpretations of the tax laws may differ from the positions and interpretations of the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
an audit by a tax authority that results in a contrary decision could have a significant negative impact on our cash position and net income 
business interruptions may impede our operations and the operations of our customers 
we are continually updating or modifying our accounting and other internal and external facing business systems 
modifications of these types of systems are often disruptive to business and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate 
failure to properly manage this process could materially harm our business operations 
in addition  we and our customers face a number of potential business interruption risks that are beyond our respective control 
natural disasters or other events could interrupt our business or the business of our customers  and each of us is reliant on external infrastructure that may be antiquated 
our corporate headquarters are located 
table of contents near a major earthquake fault 
the potential impact of a major earthquake on our facilities  infrastructure and overall operations is not known  but could be quite severe 
despite safety precautions that have been implemented  an earthquake could seriously disrupt our entire business process 
we are largely uninsured for losses and business disruptions caused by an earthquake and other natural disasters 
our stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
during and up to the date of this filing  our stock price was highly volatile ranging from a per share high of to a low of 
on december   our stock s closing price per share price was 
announcements  business developments  such as a material acquisition or disposition  litigation developments and our ability to meet the expectations of investors with respect to our operating and financial results  may contribute to current and future stock price volatility 
in addition  third party announcements such as those made by our partners and competitors may contribute to current and future stock price volatility 
for example  future announcements by microsoft corporation related to its consumer security solution may contribute to future volatility in our stock price 
certain types of investors may choose not to invest in stocks with this level of stock price volatility 
we face the risk of a decrease in our cash balances and losses in our investment portfolio 
our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world 
a portion of our cash is invested in marketable securities as part of our investment portfolio 
we rely on third party money managers to manage our investment portfolio 
among other factors  changes in interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations and macro economic conditions could cause our cash balances to fluctuate and losses in our investment portfolio 
most amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states  but  under current law  would be subject to us federal income tax  less applicable foreign tax credits 
our charter documents and delaware law and our rights plan may impede or discourage a takeover  which could lower our stock price 
our charter documents and delaware law under to our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and could have the effect of discouraging a change of control of the company or changes in management 
our classified board and other provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  could also delay or make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us or changes in our board of directors and management more difficult 
for example  any stockholder wishing to make a stockholder proposal including director nominations at our annual meeting  must meet the qualifications and follow the procedures specified under both the securities exchange act of and our bylaws 
our rights plan our board of directors has adopted a stockholders rights plan 
the rights would become exercisable on the tenth day after a person or group announces the acquisition of or more of our common stock or announces the commencement of a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in ownership by the person or group of or more of our common stock 
if the rights become exercisable  the holders of the rights other than the person acquiring or more of our common stock will be entitled to acquire in exchange for the rights exercise price  shares of our common stock or shares of any company in which we are merged with a value equal to twice the rights exercise price 
the rights plan makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and discourages a change of control of the company not approved by our board of directors

item legal proceedings special committee investigation of historical stock option granting practices we became aware of potential issues with respect to our historical stock option grants in may after the center for financial research and analysis cfra released a report titled options backdating which companies are at risk this report concluded there was a high probability that we backdated option grants from to  based on stock price trends around certain grant dates 
upon becoming aware of the cfra report  management immediately commenced a voluntary internal review involving the examination of certain stock option grants 
in may  management notified our board of directors that an internal review was in process in response to the findings in the cfra report 
during our initial review  management discovered irregularities in certain historical stock option grants and discussed these findings with the board of directors in late may we learned during the course of the initial review  and through subsequent discussions between our former general counsel and certain directors  of irregularities regarding the pricing of a grant to our former general counsel 
upon review of the findings of the internal review  the board of directors immediately terminated the employment of our former general counsel for cause 
the board of directors created a committee the special committee comprised of certain of its members who were independent of our company and management and who had not previously served as members of our board s compensation committee to conduct an investigation to evaluate the conduct and performance of our officers  employees and directors who were involved in the option granting process and to evaluate the timing of option grants  the related approval documentation and accounting implications with respect to grants made during the period from january  through march  in may  the special committee retained independent counsel and forensic accountants to assist in the investigation collectively referred to as the investigative team 
no limits were placed on the scope of the investigation 
independent counsel first met with the audit committee and with the special committee in june findings and conclusions the special committee presented its initial findings to the board of directors on october  as part of this presentation  the special committee communicated to our board of directors information concerning errors and irregularities with respect to our option granting practices  including  among others  the new hire option grant of our former president and one of the option grants to our former general counsel 
immediately following that presentation  our chairman and chief executive officer retired and our president was terminated 
the board determined this termination was a termination for cause 

table of contents the special committee investigation was completed in november the special committee concluded that there were both qualitative issues and accounting and administrative errors relating to our stock option granting process 
in this regard  the special committee concluded that certain former members of management had acted inappropriately  giving rise to qualitative concerns 
the qualitative concerns included the following in the case of our former general counsel  he and a former member of management participated in intentionally modifying one of the former general counsel s stock option grants so as to create a lower exercise price  and the former general counsel failed to disclose this unauthorized change to the board of directors prior to late may  in some instances  former members of management drafted corporate records  including employment documentation  board and compensation committee meeting minutes and actions by unanimous written consent  with the benefit of hindsight so as to choose measurement dates giving more favorable exercise prices  moreover  certain of these documents were used by us in making accounting determinations with respect to stock based compensation  during the course of the investigation  certain former members of management did not provide completely accurate or consistent information and in one case  provided documentation to the special committee that the special committee determined was intentionally altered  and certain former members of senior management did not display the appropriate oversight and tone at the top expected by the board of directors 
in addition to the foregoing  the special committee concluded that certain stock option awards were previously accounted for using incorrect measurement dates because i we had previously determined accounting measurement dates for certain stock option awards incorrectly  and  in some instances  such dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight so as to intentionally  and not inadvertently or as a result of administrative error  give more favorable exercise prices  ii the key terms for a substantial portion of the grants in an annual merit grant had been determined with finality prior to the original measurement date  with a reduction in the exercise price on the original measurement date  which represented a repricing  iii original accounting measurement dates occurred prior to approval dates  iv original accounting measurement dates occurred prior to employment commencement dates  v approval and employment commencement date documentation was incorrect or inconsistent and vi certain director grants contained clerical errors 
government inquiries relating to historical stock option practices on may   the sec notified us that an investigation had begun regarding our historical stock option grants 
on june   the sec sent us a subpoena requesting certain documents related to stock options granted between january  and the date of the subpoena 
at or around the same time we received a notice of informal inquiry from the united states department of justice  the doj  concerning our stock option granting practices 
on august   we received a grand jury subpoena from the us attorney s office for the northern district of california relating to the termination of our former general counsel  his stock option related activities and the investigation 
on november   certain members of the investigative team met with the staff of the sec s division of enforcement and presented the initial findings of the investigation 
as a result of that meeting  the scope of the investigation was expanded to include i a review of the historical option grants made by mcafee 
com  ii historical exercise activity with respect to our option grants to consider potential exercise date manipulation and iii post employment arrangements with former executives 
on november   we received a document request from the sec for option grant data for mcafee 
com  one of our former consolidated subsidiaries that had been a publicly traded company from december through september the investigative team has had meetings and continuous discussions with the sec from may through the end of the investigation in november we have provided documents requested by the sec to date  and we are cooperating with the sec s investigation 

table of contents we cannot predict how long it will take or how much more time and resources we will have to expend to resolve these government inquiries  nor can we predict the outcome of the inquiries 
there can be no assurance that other inquiries  investigations or actions will not be commenced by other united states federal or state regulatory agencies or authorities or by foreign governmental agencies or authorities and that such actions will not result in significant fines and or penalties

table of contents the state of california  county of santa clara against certain of our current and former directors and officers the state actions 
like the consolidated action  the state actions generally allege that we improperly backdated stock option grants between and the present  and that certain of our current and former officers or directors either participated in this backdating or allowed it to happen 
like the consolidated action  the state actions assert claims purportedly on behalf of us for  inter alia  breach of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  corporate waste  unjust enrichment  and gross mismanagement 
on june   we moved to dismiss these actions in favor of the first filed consolidated action 
on september   the court consolidated the state actions and denied our motions to dismiss  but stayed the state actions due to the first filed action in federal court 
the court has continued the stay on several occasions 
in december  we reached a tentative settlement with the plaintiffs in the consolidated action and the state actions 
we have accrued million in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of june  related to expected payments pursuant to the tentative settlement and expect to complete the documentation and the required approvals in late december or early in the first quarter of while we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits  the provision recorded in the financial statements represents our best estimate at this time 
sec settlement related to prior restatement on march   the sec notified us that it had commenced a formal order of private investigation into our accounting practices 
in october  we completed a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for through on september   we announced we had reserved million in connection with the proposed settlement with the sec and we had deposited million in an escrow account with the sec as the designated beneficiary 
on february   the sec entered the final judgment for the settlement with us

indemnification obligations as permitted under delaware law  we have indemnification agreements in effect whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our expense exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of future amounts paid 
other legal matters we are named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict

we determined in june that dr

the trustee returned the million shares to us in june  at which time we retired them and they were no longer included in our outstanding share balance 
in december  the trustee sold the remaining  shares in the trust for proceeds of million  and remitted the funds to us 
the terms of the trust prohibited the trustee from returning the shares to us and stipulated that only employees could benefit from the shares 
we distributed these funds to all employees below the level of vice president through a bonus which was recognized as expense in

onigma  acquired in october  complements our enterprise offerings by providing businesses with data loss prevention 
the acquisition of citadel security software s assets in december broadens our capabilities for security policy compliance enforcement and vulnerability remediation 
the majority of our net revenue has historically been derived from our mcafee security anti virus products and  until the sale of the sniffer product line in july  our sniffer technologies network fault identification and application performance management products 
we have also focused our efforts on building a full line of complementary network and system protection solutions 
on the system protection side  we strengthened our anti virus lineup by adding complementary products in the anti spam and host intrusion prevention categories  and through our june wireless security corporation acquisition  we have strengthened our solution portfolio in our consumer segment 
on the network protection side  we have added products in the network intrusion prevention and detection category  and through our october foundstone acquisition  vulnerability management products and services 
we evaluate our consolidated financial performance utilizing a variety of indicators 
two of the primary indicators that we utilize are total net revenue and net income 
as discussed more fully below  our net revenue in grew by to  million from million in we believe net revenue is a key indicator of the growth and health of our business 
our net revenue is directly impacted by corporate information technology  government and consumer spending levels 
we believe net income is a key indicator of the profitability of our business 
our net income for and was million and million  respectively 
net income in 
table of contents includes stock option related charges of million due to the adoption of sfas r and increased legal and professional fees compared to totaling approximately million due to the investigation into our past stock option granting practices  fees incurred for engaging independent consultants to examine and recommend improvements to our internal controls pursuant to our sec settlement  which was unrelated to the investigation of our stock option granting practices 
net income in was negatively impacted by a million sec settlement charge 
on february   the sec entered the final judgment for the settlement with us and the million escrow was released to the sec on february  for our net revenue was million and our net income was million 
net income in was favorably impacted by a million pre tax gain from the sale of our magic product line in january  a million pre tax gain from the sale of our sniffer product line in july and insurance reimbursements of approximately million relating to our previously settled class action lawsuit 
in addition to total net revenue and net income  in evaluating our business  management considers  among many other factors  the following net revenue by geography we operate our business in five geographic segments north america  europe  middle east and africa  collectively referred to as emea  japan  asia pacific  excluding japan  and latin america 
during  of our total net revenue was generated outside of north america 
north america and emea collectively accounted for approximately of our total net revenue in during  of our total net revenue was generated outside of north america  with north america and emea collectively accounting for approximately of our total net revenue 
north america and emea have benefited from increased corporate it spending related to security in both and revenue generated in japan was negatively impacted during as the japanese yen weakened against the us dollar compared to see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of revenue and income from operations by geographic region 
net revenue by product groups and customer category mcafee 
our mcafee products include our corporate products and our consumer products 
our corporate products include i our small and medium sized business smb products and ii our enterprise products 
these products focus on threat prevention and protection and compliance management and include our current year acquisitions and include intrushield intrusion protection products  our entercept host based intrusion protection products and foundstone risk management products that were acquired in connection with the foundstone acquisition in october revenue from our corporate products increased million  or  to million during from million in the year over year increase in revenue is due to increased corporate spending on mcafee security products  increased activity of our total protection solutions and foundstone product lines and increased maintenance renewals 
our consumer market is comprised of our mcafee consumer online subscription service and retail boxed product sales 
net revenue from our consumer security market increased million  or  to million in from million in the main driver of the increase in revenue from our consumer market is our strengthening relationships with strategic channel partners  such as aol  comcast  dell and gateway 
sniffer technologies 
net revenue from the sale of sniffer products was million in in july  we sold our sniffer product line for net cash proceeds of million 
we agreed to provide certain post closing transition services to network general corporation  the acquirer of the sniffer product line 
we were reimbursed for our cost plus a profit margin and present these reimbursements as a reduction of operating expenses on a separate line in our income statement 
the reimbursements we have recognized under this agreement totaled million in and million in we completed our obligations under the transition services agreement in july 
table of contents magic 
in  net revenue from the sale of magic solutions products totaled approximately million 
we sold the assets of our magic solutions service desk business to bmc software  inc the sale closed on january  and we received cash proceeds of approximately million  net of direct expenses 
mcafee labs 
we sold our mcafee labs assets to sparta  inc for million in april net revenue related to mcafee labs was million in and million in deferred revenue our deferred revenue balance at december  was million compared to million at december   which is an increase of 
the increase is attributable to sales of maintenance renewals from our growing customer base and increased sales of subscription based offerings 
approximately of our total net revenue during came from prior period deferred revenue 
as with revenue  we believe that deferred revenue is a key indicator of the growth and health of our business 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities the balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was  million compared to  million at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to i the repurchase of million shares of common stock for approximately million  including commissions and our obligation to withhold the number of shares required to satisfy the tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of the restricted stock of four holders for approximately million  ii acquisition related purchases totaling million including siteadvisor  inc for approximately million  preventsys  inc for approximately million  citadel security software  inc for approximately million  and onigma ltd 
for approximately million  net of cash acquired  and iii the purchase of property and equipment for approximately million 
these decreases were largely offset by i net cash provided by operating activities of million ii cash received from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under the stock purchase plans of million iii a reduction in our restricted cash of million for the settlement with the sec and iv an increase in net cash of million due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
see the liquidity and capital resources section below 
the following discussion and analysis reflects the restatement of our financial results  which is more fully described in the explanatory note regarding restatement immediately preceding part i  item  in legal proceedings in item  and in note  restatement of consolidated financial statements to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
special committee investigation of historical stock option practices we became aware of potential issues with respect to our historical stock option grants in may after the center for financial research and analysis cfra released a report titled options backdating which companies are at risk this report concluded there was a high probability that we backdated option grants from to  based on stock price trends around certain grant dates 
upon becoming aware of the cfra report  management immediately commenced a voluntary internal review involving the examination of certain stock option grants 
in may  management notified our board of directors that an internal review was in process in response to the analysis in the cfra report 
on may   we announced we had voluntarily initiated a review of our stock option grant practices during the late s and early s timeframe 
during our initial review  management discovered irregularities in certain historical stock option grants and discussed these findings with the board of directors in late may we learned during the course of the initial review  and through subsequent discussions between our former general counsel and certain directors  of irregularities regarding the pricing of a grant to our former general counsel 
upon review of the findings of the internal review  the board of directors immediately terminated the employment of our former general counsel for cause 
our board of directors established a special committee of independent directors to review our stock option granting practices and related accounting 
the special committee was assisted by independent counsel and forensic accountants collectively referred to as the investigative team 
the investigation primarily focused on the 
table of contents processes used to establish option exercise prices and obtain approvals of stock option grants and post employment option modifications 
the investigation  which covered the time period from january  through march   included a review of our historical stock option practices  accounting policies  accounting records  supporting documentation  email communications and other documentation  as well as interviews with a number of current and former directors  officers and employees 
on october   the special committee presented its initial findings to the board of directors 
as part of this presentation  the special committee communicated to our board of directors information concerning errors and irregularities with respect to the new hire option grant of our former president 
following that presentation  our chairman and chief executive officer retired and our president was terminated 
the board determined this termination was for cause 
in november  certain members of the investigative team met with the staff of the sec s division of enforcement and presented the initial findings of the investigation 
as a result of that meeting  the scope of the investigation was expanded to include a review of the i historical option grants by mcafee 
com  ii historical exercise activity with respect to our option grants to consider potential exercise date manipulation and iii post employment arrangements with former executives 
the special committee investigation was completed in november the special committee concluded that there were both qualitative issues and accounting and administrative errors relating to our stock option granting process 
in this regard  the special committee concluded that certain former members of management had acted inappropriately  giving rise to qualitative concerns 
the qualitative concerns included the following in the case of our former general counsel  he and a former member of management participated in intentionally modifying one of the former general counsel s stock option grants so as to create a lower exercise price  and the former general counsel failed to disclose this unauthorized change to the board of directors prior to late may  in some instances  former members of management drafted corporate records  including employment documentation  board and compensation committee meeting minutes and actions by unanimous written consent  with the benefit of hindsight so as to choose measurement dates giving more favorable exercise prices  moreover  certain of these documents were used by us in making accounting determinations with respect to stock based compensation  during the course of the investigation  certain former members of management did not provide completely accurate or consistent information and in one case  provided documentation to the special committee that the special committee determined was intentionally altered  and certain former members of senior management did not display the appropriate oversight and tone at the top expected by the board of directors 
in addition to the foregoing  the special committee concluded that certain stock option awards were previously accounted for using incorrect measurement dates because i such dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight so as to intentionally  and not inadvertently or as a result of administrative error  give more favorable exercise prices  ii the key terms for a substantial portion of the grants in an annual merit grant had been determined with finality prior to the original measurement date  with a reduction in the exercise price on the original measurement date  which represented a repricing  iii original accounting measurement dates occurred prior to approval dates  iv original accounting measurement dates occurred prior to employment commencement dates  v approval and employment commencement date documentation was incorrect or inconsistent and vi certain director grants contained clerical errors 
in each instance  we revised the accounting measurement date after considering all available relevant evidence 
approximately of the total intrinsic value stock price on the revised measurement date minus exercise price of all of our options and restricted stock awards remeasured as a result of this investigation were attributable to options remeasured during the period from through the special committee concluded that there were procedures in place after april to provide reasonable assurance that stock options were granted at the fair market value of the stock price on the grant date 
the special committee determined that we did not previously record appropriate charges associated with certain option modifications 
these modifications occurred upon the termination of an employee and  in some 
table of contents cases  provided for the extension of the post termination time period in which options could be exercised and allowed for the continued vesting of options subsequent to the former employee s termination date 
these option modifications occurred from to the investigation also identified an error in our accounting for options historically accounted for as variable awards 
this error was comprised of our application of transition guidance provided by fin  which required us to account for repriced options as variable awards beginning july  to correct our past accounting for stock options under apb we recorded additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense of million million net of tax for the year ended december   million million net of tax for the year ended december  and million million net of tax for the periods through we also expect to amortize less than million of such pre tax charges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment sfas r  in periods from january  through we have incurred material expenses in and as a direct result of the investigation into our stock option grant practices and related accounting 
these costs primarily related to professional services for the investigation  legal  accounting and tax guidance 
in addition  we have incurred costs related to litigation  the investigation by the sec  the grand jury subpoena from the us attorney s office for the northern district of california and the preparation and review of our restated consolidated financial statements 
we expect that we will continue to incur costs associated with these matters and that we may be subject to certain fines and or penalties resulting from the findings of the investigation 
we cannot reasonably estimate the range of fines and or penalties  if any  that might be incurred as a result of the investigation 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  income from operations and net income  as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results were to differ from these estimates materially  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about complex matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows restatement of stock based compensation expense  stock based compensation expense  revenue recognition  sales incentives and sales returns  deferred costs of revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  
table of contents estimation of restructuring accrual and litigation  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets 
restatement of stock based compensation we previously applied accounting principles bulletin no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and its related interpretations including financial accounting standards board interpretations no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb option no 
fin  and provided the required pro forma disclosure under statement of accounting financial standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas through the fiscal year ended december  under apb  a non cash  stock based compensation expense should have been recognized for any option with intrinsic value on the accounting measurement date 
an option is deemed to have intrinsic value when the exercise price is below the market price of the underlying stock on the accounting measurement date 
certain of our stock options were incorrectly measured prior to the completion of required approvals and granting actions 
after revising the measurement date for these options  certain options were deemed to have intrinsic value and  as a result  there should have been stock based compensation expense for each of these options under apb equal to the number of options multiplied by their intrinsic value on the revised measurement date 
that expense should have been amortized over the vesting period of the option 
starting in our fiscal year ended december   we adopted sfas r 
as a result  for  the additional stock based compensation required to be recorded for each of these stock options was equal to the fair value of these options on the revised measurement date for options vesting in or later 
we did not record the additional stock based compensation expenses under apb or sfas r related to these stock options in our previously issued financial statements 
as a result of the investigation  we determined that the original measurement dates we used for accounting purposes for certain option and restricted stock grants to employees from april through april were not appropriate and  in some cases  were chosen with the benefit of hindsight so as to give a more favorable exercise price 
other than director grants with clerical errors  we had no revised measurement dates from may through march we revised measurement dates and recorded stock based compensation charges due to the following errors  certain of which are the result of incorrect measurement dates from the use of hindsight to select more favorable exercise prices annual merit grant allocation and or approval not complete on the original measurement dates  the key terms for a substantial portion of the grants in an annual merit grant had been determined with finality prior to the original measurement date  with a reduction in the exercise price on the original measurement date  which represented a repricing  original accounting measurement dates prior to approval dates  original accounting measurement dates prior to employment commencement dates  incorrect or inconsistent approval and employment commencement date documentation  clerical errors in director grants  correction of accounting errors  primarily options historically accounted for as variable awards  or post employment option modifications previously not recorded 
after reviewing available relevant documentation  a general hierarchy of documentation was considered when establishing the revised measurement date for accounting purposes 
the hierarchy was considered in evaluating 
table of contents each grant on an individual basis based on the particular facts and circumstances 
the documentation considered  when available  was minutes of board of directors  compensation committee and or delegated committee approved minutes represent the best available evidence of grant approval 
the investigative team was able to validate the occurrence of board of director and compensation committee meetings on the stated dates in most cases through director payment records  billing records of outside legal counsel who attended the meetings or a signature on the minutes by external legal counsel 
unanimous written consents uwcs uwcs have an effective date that represents the date grants were approved by the compensation committee or delegated committee 
for compensation committee uwcs in and  we were not able to rely on certain uwc effective dates due to other evidence indicating that certain grants were approved subsequent to the uwc effective date 
we were able to locate other evidence to determine the approval date of these grants  such as approval documentation in emails and evidence of the date uwcs were signed 
there were no options granted in compensation committee uwcs from through for uwcs prior to  compensation committee members had historically resolved to grant options  and such action was then documented in a uwc  with the effective date being the date the granting action was taken 
with the exception of one uwc  no evidence was located that contradicted a uwc effective date as the approval date for any compensation committee grants prior to we have therefore placed reliance on the compensation committee uwcs prior to option allocations for annual merit grants allocations may be evidenced by signed and dated hard copy schedules or electronic spreadsheets that list the employees and number of options granted to each employee 
email communications to which the electronic spreadsheets were attached also provided evidence of the date allocations were completed 
we were able to validate whether allocation schedules were substantially complete by confirming individual grants in the allocation files to the actual grants reflected in our stock administration database 
there were minimal changes to allocations after the date we determined that they were substantially complete 
database dates the database date db date indicates the date an option grant was entered into the stock administration database 
entry into the stock administration database represents the best evidence of a date no later than when the grants were determined with finality 
db dates are not appropriate for determining system entry dates for our grants entered into the stock administration database prior to june  due to the implementation of a new stock administration system on that date 
all grants entered into the stock administration database prior to the system conversion have a default db date of june  db dates were applied on a grant by grant basis  resulting in multiple measurement dates for annual merit grants for which there were multiple db dates 
system reports these are hard copy reports generated from the stock administration database that have a date stamp indicating the date the report was generated 
the reports list the name  number of options and exercise price of the grants 
these reports indicate the latest date a grant could have been entered into the stock administration database  which was useful for grants prior to the june  system conversion date 
correspondence or other written documentation written communication was in the form of grant notification letters from the human resource or stock administration departments stating the key terms of a grant  stock option agreements  employment offer or promotion letters stating the number of options to be granted and automated email notifications from human resources or our third party broker 
written communication was primarily used to corroborate other available evidence used to determine measurement dates for annual merit grants  with the assumption that communication would not occur until the terms of the grants were determined with finality 
apb defines the measurement date as the first date upon which the number of options and exercise price are known 
our determination of the revised measurement date was based on our assessment that a grant was determined with finality and was no longer subject to change 
such determinations involved judgment and careful 
table of contents evaluation of all relevant facts and circumstances for each grant 
the following are the judgments involved in determining revised measurement dates 
in light of the significant judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates  alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different stock based compensation expense than recorded by us in the restatement 
while we considered various alternative approaches  we believe that the approaches we used were the most appropriate under the circumstances 
we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how the restatement adjustments described in this annual report on form k could have changed under alternative methodologies for determining measurement dates for stock option grants from through see critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for information regarding the incremental stock based compensation charges that would result from using alternate measurement dates 
date of execution of uwc for certain grants  we were unable to locate contemporaneous documentation confirming that a compensation committee meeting  or a meeting by a delegated level of authority  occurred on the effective date of the uwc 
for compensation committee uwcs with effective dates in and  which cover million options  we discovered instances in which documented approval actually occurred subsequent to the uwc effective date 
the revised measurement date in these instances is the documented approval date 
there were no options granted in compensation committee uwcs from through for uwcs prior to  which cover million options  and all delegated committee uwcs  the compensation or delegated committee resolved to grant options  and later documented such resolutions in uwcs  with an effective date which was the date of the granting actions 
with the exception of one uwc  no evidence was located that contradicted a uwc effective date as the approval date for any compensation committee grants prior to for uwcs prior to  we did not locate any evidence that caused us to question the reliability of uwcs  outside the one instance discussed above 
we have therefore placed reliance on the compensation committee uwcs prior to there were also instances where uwcs were not signed during the period prior to these unsigned uwcs were located in our minute books 
we did not locate any evidence that contradicted the effective dates of unsigned uwcs as the approval date  therefore  we have placed reliance on unsigned uwcs in this period 
had we used db dates where available  we would have recognized an additional million in stock based compensation expense from through had we used the highest closing stock price during the one month period subsequent to the uwc effective date for grants for which db dates are not available  we would have recognized an additional million in stock based compensation expense from through annual merit grants for annual merit grants  a pool of options was allocated among non executive employees  and in certain years for executives as well  in conjunction with their annual performance review 
we located evidence that allocations were completed and grants determined with finality on a business unit geographic region basis  resulting in multiple measurement dates for annual merit grants 
for grants not included in complete allocations  we have selected the db date as the revised measurement date as the terms of grants were determined with finality on or prior to the database entry dates 
the annual merit grant consisted of million options which had an original measurement date of april  we determined that the key terms were determined with finality for approximately million of these options in march  and that the exercise price was reduced to on april   which represents a repricing 
as the stock price on the revised measurement date in march exceeded the exercise price  there was grant date intrinsic value  which is being recognized over the requisite service period 
additionally  the options are accounted for as variable awards in accordance with fin due to the repricing on april  we were not able to determine allocation completion dates for the annual merit grants with an original measurement date in january we would have used db dates as revised measurement dates  however  db dates were not available for these grants 
we located hard copy stock administration system reports with a date 
table of contents stamp that provides evidence of the latest date a grant could have been entered into the stock administration database 
we used these system report dates as revised measurement dates  with the exception of certain grants for which signed and dated grant notification letters were located 
if the signature date on the letters was prior to the system report date  the revised measurement date was the letter signature date 
for annual merit grants for which we located evidence of substantially completed allocations  not all grants were included in allocations 
these grants were revised to db dates 
if these grants had been revised to the date of the last substantially complete allocation for the respective annual merit grant  we would have recognized million less in stock based compensation expense from through incorrect or inconsistent approval and employment commencement date documentation we identified certain grants to executives and directors for which the approval documentation and or employment commencement date documentation were incorrect or inconsistent 
these grants were assigned an original grant date other than the approval date  or prior to the actual employment commencement date 
in these instances  the occurrence of the meeting on the stated date in the approval documentation was validated based on director payment records or the billing records of external legal counsel who attended the meeting 
we were able to determine the correct employment commencement date based on human resources and payroll records 
the actual meeting date for the approval of such grants  or employment commencement date if later  was used as the revised measurement date 
lack of approval documentation for grants totaling million options  primarily in the years from through  we were unable to locate approval documentation 
in these instances  we examined available evidence  including email communications and grant communication letters  to determine the revised measurement date 
we also performed an analysis to determine whether these grants were recorded on dates where the stock price was at a low point  which would result in a lower exercise price 
it does not appear that these grants were priced opportunistically  and we did not discover any evidence that contradicted the original measurement date 
therefore  we did not revise the measurement dates for these grants 
if we had used the stock administration database entry date  which was available only for grants subsequent to june  the additional stock based compensation expense would have been million from through if we had used the highest stock price within days subsequent to the original measurement date  the additional stock based compensation expense would have been million from through communication dates for certain grants  we were unable to locate evidence of communication of the key terms ie  number of options and exercise price to the employee for certain grants 
we did not discover any evidence during the investigation that the communication of key terms was intentionally delayed  or there were any significant delays 
in the absence of evidence to the contrary  we have concluded that communication of the key terms occurred prior to or within a reasonable period of time of the completion of all required granting actions 
we believe that our methodology  based on the reasonable evidence  results in the most likely measurement dates for our stock option grants 
however  we also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how the restatement adjustments would have varied based on different measurement date methodologies 
based on the alternative measurement dates discussed above  the total additional stock based compensation expense resulting from grant date intrinsic value could have ranged from million to million 
stock based compensation expense on january   we adopted sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  and supersedes apb sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards on their grant dates 

table of contents our share based awards include stock options  restricted stock awards  restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
for the year ended december   we recognized stock based compensation expense of million 
prior to our adoption of sfas r  we applied the intrinsic value method set forth in apb to calculate the compensation expense for share based awards 
during  we recognized a charge of million under apb related to grant date intrinsic value resulting from revised accounting measurement dates  the exchange of mcafee 
com options in  options which were repriced in and restricted stock awards 
during  we recognized a charge of million under apb related to grant date intrinsic value resulting from revised accounting measurement dates  the exchange of mcafee 
com options in  options which were repriced in  restricted stock awards and modifications of certain option awards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our option awards and employee stock purchase rights issued under the espp 
the black scholes model requires estimates of the expected term of the option  as well as future volatility and the risk free interest rate 
for options issued during  we estimated the weighted average fair value to be 
for employee stock purchase rights issued during  we estimated the weighted average fair value to be 
the key assumptions that we used to calculate these values are provided below years ended december  stock option grants risk free interest rate weighted average expected lives years volatility dividend yield espp risk free interest rate weighted average expected lives years volatility dividend yield we derive the expected term of our options through a lattice model that factors in historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
since january   we have used the implied volatility of options traded on our stock with a term of six months or more to calculate the expected volatility of our option grants 
prior to that time  the expected volatility was based solely on the historical volatility of our stock 
we have not declared any dividends on our stock in the past and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
the assumptions that we have made represent our management s best estimate  but they are highly subjective and inherently uncertain 
if management had made different assumptions  our calculation of the options fair value and the resulting stock based compensation expense could differ  perhaps materially  from the amounts recognized in our financial statements 
for example  if we increased the assumption regarding our stock s volatility for options granted during by  our stock based compensation expense would increase by million  net of expected forfeitures 
this increased expense would be amortized over the options year vesting period 
likewise  if we increased our assumption of the expected lives of options granted during by one year  our stock based compensation expense would increase by million  net of expected forfeitures 
this increased expense would be amortized over the options year vesting period 
in addition to the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our options  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of all share based awards and only recognize expense for those awards we expect to vest 

table of contents the stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
if we were to change our estimate of forfeiture rates  the amount of share based compensation could differ  perhaps materially  from the amount recognized in our financial statements 
for example  if we had decreased our estimate of expected forfeitures by  our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   net of expected forfeitures  would have increased by million 
this decrease in our estimate of expected forfeitures would increase the amount of expense for all unvested stock options  restricted stock awards and units  and employee stock purchase rights that have not yet been recognized by million  amortized over a weighted average period of years 
revenue recognition as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
these estimates affect the deferred revenue line item on our consolidated balance sheet and the net revenue line item on our consolidated statement of income 
estimates regarding revenue affect all of our operating geographies 
our revenue is derived primarily from three sources i services and support revenue  which includes maintenance  training and consulting revenue  ii subscription revenue  which includes revenue from subscription based offerings and iii product revenue  which includes hardware and perpetual licenses revenue 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  and related interpretations to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware products that include software 
for hardware transactions where software is not incidental  we do not separate the license fee and we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
for hardware transactions where no software is involved or software is incidental  we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab 
we market and distribute our software products both as standalone software products and as comprehensive security solutions 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when all of the following are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product or service has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence is generally a binding purchase order or license agreement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier or upon delivery of a grant letter and license key  if applicable 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms of typically to days  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fees and recognize revenue upon cash receipt  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we enter into perpetual and subscription software license agreements through direct sales to customers and indirect sales with partners  distributors and resellers 
we recognize revenue from the indirect sales channel upon sell through by the partner or distributor 
the license agreements generally include service and support agreements  for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period 
all revenue derived from our online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period 
professional services revenue is generally recognized as services are performed or if required  upon customer acceptance 
for arrangements with multiple elements  including software licenses  maintenance and or services  we allocate and defer revenue equivalent to the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  of fair value for the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as product revenue 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately or upon substantive renewal rates stated in a contract 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of stand alone sales of these elements to our customers 
when 
table of contents vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period generally as services and support revenue 
sales incentives and sales returns we reduce revenue for estimates of sales incentives and sales returns 
we offer sales incentives  including channel rebates  marketing funds and end user rebates for products in our corporate and consumer product lines 
additionally  end users may return our products  subject to varying limitations  through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on our historical experience 
in each accounting period  we must make judgments and estimates of sales incentives and potential future sales returns related to current period revenue 
these estimates affect our net revenue line item on our consolidated statement of income and affect our net accounts receivable  deferred revenue or accrued liabilities line items on our consolidated balance sheet 
these estimates affect all of our operating geographies 
at december   our allowance for sales returns and incentives was million compared to million at december  if our allowance for sales returns and incentives were to increase by  or million  our net revenue would decrease by million and our deferred revenue would decrease by million for the year ended december  deferred costs of revenue deferred costs of revenue  which consist primarily of costs related to revenue sharing arrangements and costs of inventory sold into our channel which have not been sold through to the end user  are included in prepaid expenses and prepaid taxes and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we only defer direct and incremental costs related to revenue sharing arrangements and recognize such deferred costs proportionate to the related revenue recognized 
at december   our deferred costs were million compared to million at december  allowance for doubtful accounts we also make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances  current and historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for any account receivable for which there are identified collection issues 
these estimates affect the general and administrative line item on our statement of income and the net accounts receivable line item on the consolidated balance sheet 
the estimation of uncollectible accounts affects all of our operating geographies 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million compared to million at december  if an additional of our gross accounts receivable were deemed to be uncollectible at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts would increase by million and our provision for bad debt expense  revenue and deferred revenue would also be affected 
estimation of restructuring accrual and litigation restructuring accrual 
during  we permanently vacated several leased facilities and recorded a million accrual for estimated lease related costs associated with the permanently vacated facilities 
during  we permanently vacated several leased facilities  including an additional two floors in our santa clara headquarters building and recorded a million restructuring accrual 
in  as part of a consolidation of activities into our plano  texas facility from our headquarters in santa clara  california  we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
we recorded these facility restructuring charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for exit costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
to determine our restructuring charges and the corresponding liabilities  sfas required us to make a number of assumptions 
these assumptions included estimated sublease income over the remaining lease period  estimated term of subleases  estimated utility and real estate broker fees  as well as estimated discount rates 
table of contents for use in calculating the present value of our liability 
we developed these assumptions based on our understanding of the current real estate market in the respective locations as well as current market interest rates 
the assumptions used are our management s best estimate at the time of the accrual  and adjustments are made on a periodic basis if better information is obtained 
if  at december   our estimated sublease income were to decrease  the restructuring reserve and related expense would have increased by million 
the estimates regarding our restructuring accruals affect our current liabilities and other long term liabilities line items in our consolidated balance sheet  since these liabilities will be settled each year through these estimates affect our statement of income in the restructuring line item 
litigation 
management s current estimated range of liability related to litigation that is brought against us from time to time is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss as there is no better point of estimate 
because of the uncertainties related to an unfavorable outcome of litigation  and the amount and range of loss on pending litigation  management is often unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as litigation progresses  we continue to assess our potential liability and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
estimates of litigation liability affect our accrued liability line item on our consolidated balance sheet and our general and administrative expense line item on our statement of income 
see note in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess and make significant estimates regarding the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
estimates related to income taxes affect the deferred tax asset and liability line items and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and our income tax expense line item in our statement of income 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  is million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance is recorded due to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits and net operating losses of acquired companies 
the valuation allowance is based on our historical experience and estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
tax returns are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
although we believe that adequate accruals have been made each period for unsettled issues  additional benefits or expenses could occur in future years from resolution of outstanding matters 
we record additional expenses each period on unsettled issues relating to the expected interest we would be required to pay a tax authority if we do not prevail on an unsettled issue 
we continue to assess our potential tax liability included in accrued taxes in the consolidated financial statements  and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
we have classified a portion of our tax liability as non current in the consolidated balance sheet based on the expected timing of cash payments to settle contingencies with taxing authorities 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles  and long lived assets we account for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance 
table of contents of amortization for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles and at least an annual test for impairment 
an impairment review may be performed more frequently in the event circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we are required to make estimates regarding the fair value of our reporting units when testing for potential impairment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
we estimate cash flows for these purposes using internal budgets based on recent and historical trends 
we base these estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we also make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate the carrying value for each of our reporting units 
if an impairment were present  these estimates would affect an impairment line item on our consolidated statement of income and would affect the goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet 
as goodwill is allocated to all of our reporting units  any impairment could potentially affect each operating geography 
based on our most recent impairment test  there would have to be a significant change in assumptions used in such calculation in order for an impairment to occur as of december  we account for finite lived intangibles and long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under this standard we will record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many of the factors  noted below as triggering factors  which may change in the near term 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we did not hold any other indefinite lived intangibles as of december  and net finite lived intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively

this increase was partially offset by a million decrease attributable to mcafee labs  which was sold in april net revenue from our corporate business increased during compared to primarily due to i increased corporate spending on mcafee security products and ii increased revenue from our mcafee intrushield and mcafee foundstone offerings 
net revenue from our intrushield and foundstone product lines increased million and million  respectively

net revenue from north america and emea has historically comprised between and of our business 
the increase in total net revenue in north america during primarily related to i a million increase in corporate revenue in north america due to increased corporate spending on mcafee security products and increased revenue from our foundstone and intrushield product lines and ii a million increase in consumer revenue in north america partially offset by a million decrease attributable to mcafee labs  which was sold in april the increase in total net revenue in north america during primarily related to a million increase in consumer revenue in north america due to our increased customer base  partially offset by i a million decrease in sniffer revenue in north america due to the sale of our sniffer product line in july  ii a million decrease in mcafee labs revenue in north america due to the sale of mcafee labs in april  iii a million decrease in corporate revenue in north america  iv a million decrease in magic revenue in north america due to the sale of our magic product line in january and v our perpetual plus licensing arrangements which were introduced in and resulted in lower rates of up front revenue recognition and an increase in the amount of revenue deferred to future periods 
the increase in total net revenue in emea during was attributable to i a million increase in corporate revenue due to increased corporate spending on mcafee security products and increased revenue from our foundstone and intrushield product lines and ii a million increase in consumer revenue from online subscriber growth due to our increased customer base 
net revenue from emea was also positively impacted by the strengthening euro against the us dollar  which resulted in an approximate million impact to emea net revenue in compared to the increase in total net revenue in emea during was attributable to i a million increase in consumer revenue due to online subscriber growth due to our increased customer base and expansion to additional

net revenue from our consumer market in both north america and in emea increased during and primarily due to i online subscriber growth due to our increased customer base and expansion to additional countries and ii increased online renewal rates 
additionally  in  net revenue from our consumer market increased due to increased retail revenue due to higher levels of contract support renewal revenue generated from our increased retail sales due to numerous virus outbreaks in through and new product offerings 
our japan  latin america and asia pacific operations combined have historically comprised less than of our total net revenue and we expect this trend to continue 
although total net revenue from japan increased in compared to  the weakening japanese yen against the us dollar resulted in an approximate million negative impact to japanese net revenue 
risks inherent in international revenue include the impact of longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  seasonality  political instability  tariffs and other trade barriers  currency fluctuations  a high incidence of software piracy in some countries  product localization  international labor laws  compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and our relationship with our employees and regional work councils and difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international revenue

the increase in service and support revenue in compared to was attributable to an increase in support and maintenance primarily due to amortization of previously deferred revenue from support arrangements and an increase in sales of support renewals offset slightly by a decrease in consulting and training revenue 
the increase in service and support revenue in compared to was attributable to an increase in support and maintenance primarily due to maintenance renewals on our growing customer base and our perpetual plus licensing model 
in addition  in april we increased our support pricing on selected consumer products  including virusscan and mcafee internet security 

table of contents our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on renewals of support arrangements as well as our ability to respond successfully to the pace of technological change and expand our customer base 
if our renewal rate or our pace of new customer acquisition slows  our net revenue and operating results would be adversely affected 
additionally  support pricing under the perpetual plus model is significantly higher than the previous model 
in the event customers choose not to renew their support arrangements under the perpetual plus model  revenue could be negatively impacted

table of contents a subscription based model and iii an increase in incentive rebates and marketing funds with our partners that are recorded as an offset to revenue and generally included in retail and other revenue in the table above 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in foundstone hardware revenue and an increase in demand for intrushield 
generally  our corporate customers license our software on a perpetual basis and our consumer customers license our software on a subscription basis 
with the launch of our mcafee consumer suites in  all consumer licenses are subscription based 
the continued use of a subscription based model for licenses will result in product revenue declines with a corresponding increase in subscription revenue 
the decrease in product revenue from compared to was attributable to i a decrease in license revenue in due to the introduction of our perpetual plus licensing arrangements in the united states in the first quarter of and in emea and asia pacific in the middle of  resulting in reduced product revenue and increased services and support revenue  and due to our continued shift in focus from retail boxed products to our online subscription model for consumers  ii an increase in incentive rebates and marketing funds with our partners which are recorded as an offset to revenue and included in retail and other revenue in the table above  and iii the sales of our sniffer product line sale in july and our magic product line in january  partially offset by a general increase in corporate it spending related to security 
the introduction of the perpetual plus licensing arrangement has resulted in declines in license revenue with a corresponding increase in services and support revenue 
in addition  in april we increased our support pricing on selected consumer products  including virusscan and mcafee internet security  which resulted in a decrease in product revenue in due to allocating more revenue related to service and support and recognizing this deferred revenue ratably over the service and support period

table of contents revenue increased in total  and as a percentage of service and support revenue for due primarily to increased allocation of technical support costs and to an increase in costs associated with increased service and support revenue 
in our technical support teams devoted proportionately more time to routine customer support and less time to product development

we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in revenue and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
in  and  we did not make any significant changes to our payment terms for our customers  which are generally net in  the increase in cash related to accounts payable  accrued taxes and other liabilities was million  which included the payment of the million penalty to the sec 
our operating cash flows  including changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  are impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and taxing authorities 
we typically pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with invoice terms and conditions  and take advantage of invoice discounts when available 
the timing of future cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the nature of accounts payable arrangements 
in  and  we did not make any significant changes to our payment timing to our vendors 
in the third quarter of  we placed million in escrow for a proposed settlement with the sec relating to the formal order of private investigation into our accounting practices that commenced during see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on february   the sec entered the final judgment for settlement with us 
the million escrow was released and transferred to the sec on february  the transfer to the sec out of escrow is reflected as cash provided by investing activities of million and cash used in operating activities of million 
the interest earned on the amount in escrow was released to us when the transfer was made to the sec and is reflected as a positive adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows for year ended december  our cash and marketable securities balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the united states 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  was held outside the united states

in addition  we have incurred costs related to litigation  the informal investigation by the sec  the grand jury subpoena from the us attorney s office for the northern district of california and the preparation and review of our restated consolidated financial statements 
we expect that we will continue to incur costs associated with these matters and that we may be subject to certain fines and or penalties resulting from the findings of the investigation 
we cannot reasonably estimate the range of fines and or penalties  if any  that might be incurred as a result of the investigation 
we expect to pay for these obligations with available cash 
we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash and internally generated funds 
we expect to continue generating positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue or what the effect on our business might be from the competitive environment in which we operate 
in addition  we currently cannot predict the outcome of the litigation described in note we do believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
investing activities our investing activities for the years ended december   and are as follows in thousands years ended december  as restated as restated purchase of marketable securities proceeds from sale of marketable securities proceeds from maturites of marketable securities decrease increase in restricted cash purchase of property and equipment and leasehold improvements acquisitions  net of cash acquired proceeds from sale of assets and technology net cash used in provided by investing activities investments in  net purchases of marketable securities was million compared to net proceeds from sales and maturities of million in and net purchases of marketable securities of million in we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we generally hold investments in money market  us government fixed income and us government agency fixed income  mortgage backed and investment grade corporate fixed income securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including investment securities of a short term and long term nature 
restricted cash the current restricted cash balance of million at december  reflected the million we placed in escrow for the sec settlement and the interest earned on the escrow which was restricted until released by the sec

we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business and our business outlook 
acquisitions during  we paid million  net of cash received  for acquisitions  including million for the purchase of substantially all of the assets of citadel security software  inc  million for the outstanding capital shares of siteadvisor  inc  million for the outstanding capital shares of onigma ltd  and million for the outstanding capital shares of preventsys  inc in june  we acquired all the outstanding stock  technology and assets of wireless security corporation for million in cash  including acquisition costs and net of cash acquired

we received cash proceeds from these plans in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
beginning in july  we suspended purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  returned all withholdings to our participating employees  including interest based on a per annum interest rate  and prohibited our employees from exercising stock options due to the announced investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and our inability to become current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in  we changed our equity compensation program for existing employees by starting to grant  in certain instances  restricted stock units in addition to awarding stock options 
we continued to grant stock options to new employees 
although management and our compensation committee have not determined what type of equity compensation we will use to reward top performing employees in the future  if management and our compensation committee decide to grant only restricted stock units  which provide no proceeds to us  going forward  our proceeds from issuance of common stock will decrease significantly 
excess tax benefits from stock based compensation the excess tax benefit reflected as a financing cash inflow in represents excess tax benefits realized relating to share based payments to our employees  in accordance with sfas r

prior to the suspension of repurchases in july  we used million  including commissions  to repurchase million of our common shares in the open market under our stock repurchase program in in addition  we used approximately million in connection with our obligation to four holders of restricted stock to withhold the number of shares 
table of contents required to satisfy such holders tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of such shares 
in  and  we repurchased million and million shares of our common stock  respectively 
the timing and size of future repurchases are subject to us becoming current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  approval by our board of directors  market conditions  stock prices  our cash position and other cash requirements 
we expect that our executive management will recommend to our board of directors that a new common stock repurchase program be authorized 
redemption of convertible debt in  we used million of cash for the repurchase of convertible debt 
contribution of proceeds from sale of common stock held in trust in  we deposited million shares of common stock with a trustee for the benefit of the employees of the dr 
solomon s acquisition to cover the stock options assumed in the acquisition of this company 
these shares  which have been included in the outstanding share balance  were to be issued upon the exercise of stock options by dr 
solomon s employees 
we determined in june that dr 
solomon s employees had exercised million options  and that we had issued new shares in connection with these exercises rather than the trust shares 
the trustee returned the million shares to us in june  at which time they were retired and were no longer included in the outstanding share balance 
in december  the trustee sold the remaining  shares in the trust for proceeds of million  and remitted the funds to us 
the terms of the trust prohibited the trustee from returning the shares to us and stipulated that only employees could benefit from the shares 
we paid out the million to our employees as a bonus in credit facility we have a million euro credit facility with a bank 
the credit facility is available on an offering basis  meaning that transactions under the credit facility will be on such terms and conditions  including interest rate  maturity  representations  covenants and events of default  as mutually agreed between us and the bank at the time of each specific transaction 
the credit facility is intended to be used for short term credit requirements  with terms of one year or less 
the credit facility can be cancelled at any time 
no balances were outstanding as of december  and december  contractual obligations a summary of our fixed contractual obligations and commitments at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases other commitments purchase obligations total operating leases are for office space and office equipment 
the operating lease commitments above reflect contractual and reasonably assured rent escalations under the lease arrangements 
the majority of our lease contractual obligations relate to the following five leases million for the santa clara  california facility lease  million for the slough  united kingdom facility lease  million for the cork  ireland facility lease  million for the bangalore  india facility lease and million for the sunnyvale california lease 
other commitments are minimum commitments on telecom contracts  contractual commitments for naming rights and advertising services and software licensing agreements and royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

table of contents we generally issue purchase orders to our contract manufacturers with delivery dates from four to six weeks from the purchase order date 
in addition  we regularly provide such contract manufacturers with rolling six month forecasts of product requirements for planning and long lead time parts procurement purposes only 
we are committed to accept delivery of materials pursuant to our purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow us to delay receipt of such order or allow us to cancel orders beyond certain agreed lead times 
such cancellations may or may not include cancellation costs payable by us 
if we are unable to adequately manage our contract manufacturers and adjust such commitments for changes in demand  we may incur additional inventory expenses related to excess and obsolete inventory 
in addition to the contractual obligations above and as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion or all of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
all of our subsidiaries are owned by us and are fully consolidated into our consolidated financial statements 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
foreign currency risk as a global concern  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our functional currency is typically the currency of the local country 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in europe  latin america  and asia 
at the present time  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
the success of this activity depends upon estimates of transaction activity denominated in various currencies  primarily the euro  the british pound  the brazilian real  the japanese yen  and the indian rupee 
to the extent that these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
to reduce exposures associated with nonfunctional net monetary asset positions in various currencies  we enter into forward contracts 
our foreign exchange contracts typically range from one to three months in original maturity 
we have not hedged anticipated foreign currency cash flows nor do we enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
we do not use any derivatives for speculative purposes 
at december   the fair value of our forward contracts outstanding was million 
at december   we had no forward contracts outstanding 
forward contracts existing during and did not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly were marked to market at the end of each reporting period with any unrealized gain or loss being recognized in the interest and other income line on the consolidated statements of income 
net realized losses arising from the settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts were million and million in and during  we recognized a gain arising from the settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts of million 

table of contents forward contracts outstanding at december  and their fair values are presented below in thousands december  euro british pound sterling brazilian real interest rate risk investments we maintain balances in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
all financial instruments used are in accordance with our investment policy 
we maintain our investment securities in portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities including money market  government agency  mortgage backed and investment grade corporate bonds 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities held at december  that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps over six and twelve month time horizons
