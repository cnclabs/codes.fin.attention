item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands overview cavalier homes  inc and its subsidiaries produce  sell and finance manufactured housing 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many of the same economic and demographic factors that affect the housing market as a whole 
as a result of the growth in the industry during much of the s  the number of retail dealerships  manufacturing capacity and wholesale shipments expanded significantly  which ultimately created slower retail turnover  higher retail inventory levels and increased price competition 
also  the industry has been impacted by an increase in dealer failures  a severe reduction in available consumer credit and wholesale dealer financing for manufactured housing  more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels  each of which contributed to a reduction in wholesale industry shipments to a year low in industry results for posted the first increase since with floor shipments increasing over by due to industry wide orders by the federal emergency management agency fema as part of that agency s hurricane disaster relief efforts 
the manufactured housing institute s mhi estimate of fema shipments in the last four months of and during totaled approximately  floors and  floors  respectively 
our estimate for fema shipments in the first quarter of is approximately  floors 
factoring out the effects of the fema orders in and  industry shipments were down slightly 
industry shipments in  excluding shipments to fema  were below levels and below levels 
industry company shipments and market share mhi reported that wholesale floor shipments were down cumulatively from january  through december  as noted in the following table floor shipments nationwide cavalier s core states year industry increase decrease from prior year cavalier increase decrease from prior year market share industry increase decrease from prior year cavalier increase decrease from prior year market share the table above has been adjusted from to only include our hud code homes  which are manufactured homes that meet the specifications of national building standards administered by the us department of housing and urban development excludes modular homes for the and years 
during  we entered into agreements with two companies to build  single section homes for delivery to fema as part of that agency s disaster relief for the gulf coast states hit by hurricanes 
under the agreements  we shipped  single section homes  which accounted for of sales  and in the first quarter of  we shipped the remaining homes 
during  our floor shipments decreased as compared to  while industry wide shipments decreased  with our market share being 
in our core states  our market share declined to from in the comparable prior year period due to increased competition  including new entrants in the east south central region 
our market share has continued to decline over the last four years due to a variety of causes  including the intensely competitive marketplace  lack of chattel home only financing for all homes  consolidation of our sales force  and the closing of six manufacturing facilities 
one of our goals for is to increase our share of the national market through new product introductions  brand awareness and a focus on operational efficiencies 
potential for modular housing expansion currently  the substantial majority of our homes produced are hud code homes 
additionally  we produce modular homes  which are constructed to local  regional or state building codes 
modular homes generally have a different and more complex roof system than hud code homes  are typically two or more sections  and  when combined with land  usually qualify for traditional mortgage financing  which generally has better terms than financing for a hud code home 
the national market for modular housing was approximately  homes in and according to the national modular housing council nmhc 
according to nmhc which includes information from the significant states   modular homes were shipped industry wide in  a decrease of from we shipped and modular homes during and  respectively  for a year over year increase of 
while our current participation in the modular market is small  we are seeking to further develop our modular home sales base because we are hopeful that some of those looking to replace hurricane damaged homes in the gulf coast region will consider modular homes as a viable alternative to traditional site built housing 
the following table summarizes the information with respect to the modular market units shipped year industry increase decrease from prior year cavalier increase decrease from prior year market share source nmhc industry finance environment a major factor contributing to the manufactured housing industry growth in the s was the relaxation of credit standards due to intense competition  which ultimately resulted in a change in the financing approach in the industry due to underperforming manufactured housing loans 
throughout the past eight years  the industry has been impacted significantly by reduced financing available at both the wholesale and retail levels  with several lenders exiting the marketplace or limiting their participation in the industry  coupled with more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions  which re enter home distribution channels and limit wholesale shipments of new homes 
while the current industry trend is toward more land home real estate financing rather than chattel or home only loans  additional chattel lending availability could result in renewed demand for single section products 
while land home financing generally offers more favorable credit terms to the retail buyer of manufactured housing  the length of time involved in closing land home transactions is longer 
the potential infusion of new and competitive lending capacity  which we believe is essential to support demand at higher levels  has not materialized 
in late  our finance subsidiary  cis  was awarded up to  by fannie mae to implement a high end product pilot program for hud code manufactured multi section homes 
this program will allow site built comparables  pricing and underwriting for high end hud code multi section homes for which enhanced property eligibility requirements are met 
the first loan under this program is expected to be closed in the first quarter of while we are cautiously optimistic about this program  we are unable to determine if this pilot program will be successful and provide the longer term financing our industry needs for growth 
until there is substantial entry of finance resources to the manufactured housing market  we believe a meaningful expansion for the industry will be delayed 
raw materials cost and gross margin in  our gross margin decreased in part due to cost increases we experienced in substantially all raw materials as a result of rising commodity prices 
certain prices have continued to increase although lumber costs moderated during the last half of the year 
while we seek to offset rising costs through increasing our selling prices  sudden increases in raw material costs  coupled with dealers order backlogs  can affect the timing and our ability to pass on these cost increases 
we are uncertain at this time as to the impact the extent and duration of the increased costs will have on our future revenue and earnings 
capacity and overhead cost in response to the continued weakening of industry market conditions  we closed nine manufacturing facilities between the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of we generally have been able to sell to the customers of these plants with the exception of the pennsylvania and texas plants from one or more of our current operating plants 
the remaining plants also handle dealer sales and customer service for our homes 
in terms of operating costs  we have made cost reductions in virtually all areas of operations  including our exclusive dealer and marketing programs and our administrative personnel and associated costs 
our winfield  alabama facility was re opened in september in order to assist in the production of the fema units mentioned above and to participate in the production of our other products 
excluding fema product shipments  floors in and floors in  our shipments were below our expectations due in part to difficult market conditions in the east coast markets primarily florida  georgia  north carolina and south carolina  where floors shipped were below the same period last year 
lower results by our north carolina and georgia operations were offset partially by improvements in our alabama operations  where floors shipped improved by over the same period in we continue to monitor the relationship between demand and capacity 
debt and liquidity we continued to improve our long term debt position in by making scheduled principal repayments as well as making additional principal repayments from proceeds from sales of certain property  including the sale of the adrian facility in the fourth quarter of during  long term debt decreased by  from  to  which included scheduled payments of  and additional principal payments of  during the fourth quarter of  we borrowed  under the revolving line of credit in order to fund our short term cash needs required to fulfill the fema related order 
during the first quarter of  the line of credit balance was paid in full 
we did not have any amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit at december  outlook while the manufactured housing industry posted an increase in shipments for over  the increase was due to the impact of fema orders after hurricanes devastated housing in many areas in the gulf coast region 
the following table illustrates the continuing softness of the underlying hud code business industry home shipments by year total home shipments less estimated fema industry shipments less fema fema shipments as estimated by us 
we continue to believe the substantial hurricane damage in the gulf coast region will create opportunities for our industry beyond the temporary housing supplied through fema orders in and the first quarter of we expect that strain on conventional home building resources will likely cause some of those looking to replace damaged homes to consider manufactured housing  including modular homes  as a viable alternative to traditional site built housing 
however  we also expect rebuilding efforts to impose greater strains on the availability of certain building materials  which will likely result in increased costs 
it is hard to predict the timing of the recovery effort because of zoning  insurance settlements  flood plain restrictions  customer and community acceptance  as well as local economic conditions 
longer term  substantial entry of competitive lending capacity in the industry  which we believe is essential to support demand at higher levels  is needed for a meaningful expansion for the industry 
we have taken steps in recent years to reduce costs and lower our breakeven point 
we will continue to focus on internal projects and plans to increase manufacturing efficiencies in to further reduce costs 
industry shipments in are expected to be comparable to the levels  excluding the impact from fema  based on industry analysts estimates in the range of  to  floors 
as we noted above  our focus is to increase our market share in  but we believe will be a challenging year 
further changes in general economic conditions that affect consumer purchases  availability of adequate financing sources  increases in repossessions or dealer failures and further commodity price increases could affect our results of operations

revenue from the retail segment was  for compared to  for gross profit gross profit was  or of total revenue for  versus  or of total revenue in the  decrease in gross profit and decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of lower sales volume  especially in the last half of the year  and increased raw material prices 
gross profit was favorably impacted in by higher production levels of a large number of homes with like specifications for the fema related orders  primarily in the fourth quarter 
we have experienced price increases in substantially all raw materials certain prices continue to increase and overall commodity pressures due in part to global demand  capacity constraints and rising oil prices 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses during were  or of total revenue  versus  or of total revenue in  a decrease of  or 
the overall decrease included a  decrease in insurance costs as a result of a retrospective liability insurance credit of  a  decrease in salaries and incentive compensation attributable to a decrease in incentive compensation on lower profits offset by an increase in overall salaries  and a decrease in losses on our installment loan portfolio  including homes repossessed 
these net decreases were offset by a  increase in employee benefit costs  primarily for health insurance expense on a higher level of average employment during the year and an increase in health care costs per employee 
we adopted sfas no

operating income operating income for was compared to  in segment operating results were as follows home manufacturing operating income  before intercompany eliminations  was  in as compared to  in the decreased home manufacturing operating income is primarily due to our participation in building single section homes as part of the fema disaster relief in as discussed above and raw material price increases 
financial services operating income was in as compared to in the slight revenue increase from the financial services segment and the decrease in losses on our installment loan portfolio as discussed above are the primary factors for the increase in operating income 
the retail segment s operating loss of in compares to almost breakeven in general corporate operating expense  which is not identifiable to a specific segment  decreased from  in to  in primarily due to decreased incentive compensation costs 
other income expense interest expense decreased in to  from  in primarily due to lower levels of borrowings  including the march repayment of amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit of  which we borrowed in the fourth quarter of to fund short term cash requirements to complete the fema order 
additional principal payments during the year from proceeds of sales of certain properties also reduced overall interest expense

we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances is largely dependent upon future profitable operations and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including anticipated operating results  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  and tax planning strategies 
in  our assessment of the valuation allowance considered the following factors our operating performance  which was significantly below previous projections  a year industry low in for shipments of manufactured housing with each quarter s shipments lower than the previous quarter  projected shipments for that could be relatively flat compared to shipments  and our lack of visibility with respect to our results 
due to these factors  we recorded an adjustment to our valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets  which totaled  as of december in  as a result of continuing improvements in operating performance and projected income and tax liability for  we reversed a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and realized  in deferred tax benefits 
because we believed challenging industry conditions would persist in  we further believed that under the standards of sfas no 
it was not appropriate to record income tax benefits in excess of the benefit projected to be realized in as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance of  the valuation allowance may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred income tax assets are realized or the valuation allowances are otherwise no longer required

during the industry downturn  we benefited from the proceeds of sales of idle facilities as a replacement source of funds due to net operating losses 
currently  we have two previously idled facilities that are being marketed for sale  however  we cannot predict when or at what amounts the facilities will ultimately be sold 
our trend of cash used in operating activities over the past several years is a direct result of the continuing downturn in the industry and our net losses as a result 
the industry has been impacted by an increase in dealer failures  a severe reduction in available consumer credit and wholesale dealer financing for manufactured housing  more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels 
each of these factors contributed to a reduction in wholesale industry shipments to a year low in however  our cash position improved in due to collection of the outstanding receivables from fema at december  during  we entered into agreements as a subcontractor to provide  homes to fema as part of that agency s hurricane relief efforts 
in order to fund our short term cash needs required to fulfill the orders of fema homes  we amended our credit facility the credit facility with our primary lender to provide for an available revolving line of credit during the period of october  through april  the first temporary advance period of  and during the period of may  through july  the second temporary advance period of  effectively waiving temporarily the tangible net worth requirement listed below

on february   subsequent to year end  we further amended the terms of the credit facility  to  among other things  i extend the maturity date to april   ii reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings if tnw exceeds  and iii increase the annual capital expenditure limit to  per year 
the credit facility is comprised of a revolving line of credit which provides for borrowings including letters of credit up to   during the first temporary advance period and a real estate term loan initial term of years component of  which are cross secured and cross defaulted 
the amount available under the revolving line of credit  up to   during the first temporary advance period  is equal to the lesser of an amount based on defined percentages of accounts and notes receivable and inventories or certain levels of tangible net worth plus all treasury stock purchases after december   as noted in the following table

interest on the term note is fixed for a period of five years from issuance at and may be adjusted at and years 
amounts outstanding under the real estate term loan are collateralized by certain plant facilities and equipment 
the credit facility  as amended  contains certain restrictive and financial covenants which  among other things  limit our ability without the lender s consent to i make dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock in an aggregate amount which exceeds of consolidated net income for the two most recent years  ii mortgage or pledge assets which exceed in the aggregate  iii incur additional indebtedness  including lease obligations  which exceed in the aggregate  excluding floor plan notes payable which cannot exceed  and iv make annual capital expenditures of  for the year ended december  and  thereafter as amended on february  
in addition  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants requiring us to maintain on a consolidated basis certain defined levels of debt to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to and cash flow to debt service ratio of not less than to for the year ending december  and not less than to for the year ending december  as amended february  and thereafter  and to maintain a current ratio  as defined  of at least to and consolidated tangible net worth of at least  the credit facility also requires cis to comply with certain specified restrictions and financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants 
we have amounts outstanding under four industrial development revenue bond issues bonds which totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
three of the bond issues bear interest at variable rates ranging from to and mature at various dates through april one of the bond issues is payable in annual installments through with interest payable monthly at a variable rate currently at as determined by a remarketing agent 
the real estate term loan and the bonds are collateralized by substantially all of our plant facilities and equipment 
we have  and  of notes payable under a retail floor plan agreement at december  and december   respectively 
the notes are collateralized by certain company owned retail stores new home inventories and bear interest rates ranging from prime to prime plus but not less than based on the age of the home 
since its inception  cis has been restricted in the amount of loans it could purchase based on underwriting standards  as well as the availability of working capital and funds borrowed under its credit line with its primary lender 
from time to time  we evaluate the potential to sell all or a portion of our remaining installment loan portfolio  in addition to the periodic sale of installment contracts purchased by cis in the future 
cis is currently re selling loans to other lenders under various retail finance contracts 
we believe the periodic sale of installment contracts under these retail finance agreements will reduce requirements for both working capital and borrowings  increase our liquidity  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and enhance our ability to increase our volume of loan purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional sales will be made under these agreements  or that we will be able to realize the expected benefits from such agreements 
we believe existing cash and funds available under the credit facility  together with cash provided by operations  will be adequate to fund our operations and plans for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances to this effect 
if it is not  or if we are unable to remain in compliance with our covenants under our credit facility  we would seek to maintain or enhance our liquidity position and capital resources through modifications to or waivers under the credit facility  incurrence of additional short or long term indebtedness or other forms of financing  asset sales  restructuring of debt  and or the sale of equity or debt securities in public or private transactions  the availability and terms of which will depend on various factors and market and other conditions  some of which are beyond our control 
projected cash to be provided by operations in the coming year is largely dependent on sales volume 
our manufactured homes are sold mainly through independent dealers who generally rely on third party lenders to provide floor plan financing for homes purchased 
in addition  third party lenders generally provide consumer financing for manufactured home purchases 
our sales depend in large part on the availability and cost of financing for manufactured home purchasers and dealers as well as our own retail locations 
the availability and cost of such financing is further dependent on the number of financial institutions participating in the industry  the departure of financial institutions from the industry  the financial institutions lending practices  the strength of the credit markets in general  governmental policies  and other conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
throughout the past eight years the industry has been impacted significantly by reduced financing available at both the wholesale and retail levels  with several lenders exiting the marketplace or limiting their participation in the industry  coupled with more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels and limit wholesale shipments of new homes 
unfavorable changes in these factors and terms of financing in the industry may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements our material off balance sheet arrangements consist of repurchase obligations  guarantees and letters of credit 
each of these arrangements is discussed below under contractual obligations and commitments 
contractual obligations and commitments dollars in thousands the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  for additional information related to these obligations  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this table excludes long term obligations for which there is no definite commitment period 
our debt consists primarily of fixed rate debt 
however  there is one bond that has a variable interest rate 
we estimated the interest payments due for this bond using  which is a slight increase from the latest applicable interest rate 
we do not have any contractual purchase obligations  and historically  have not entered into contracts committing us to purchase specified quantities of materials or equipment 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years industrial development revenue bond issues real estate term loan interest operating leases total contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contingent commitments at december   including contingent repurchase obligations  guarantees of debt for equity method investees and letters of credit

although the commitments outstanding at december  have a finite life  these commitments are continually replaced as we continue to sell our manufactured homes to dealers under repurchase and other recourse agreements with lending institutions which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to dealers 
the cost net recoveries of these contingent repurchase obligations to us was  and 
we have a reserve for repurchase commitments of  and  based on prior experience and an evaluation of dealers financial conditions 
we and certain of our equity partners have guaranteed certain debt for one company in which we own a one third interest 
the guarantees are limited to of the outstanding debt 
at december    of debt was outstanding under the guarantees  of which we had guaranteed subsequent to december   this company sold the last of its properties and repaid all of the debt 
therefore  our guarantees related to this debt have expired 
we have provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our surety bonds and insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
the outstanding letters of credit reduce amounts available under our credit facility 
we have recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies 
critical accounting estimates we follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements as summarized in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors  current economic conditions and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations that require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
product warranties we provide the initial retail homebuyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors and current industry trends 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical sales amounts and warranty costs related to homes sold and any outstanding service work orders 
we have a reserve for estimated warranties of  and  
although we maintain reserves for such claims  based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims or per claim costs exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
insurance our workers compensation prior to february   and after april   product liability and general liability insurance coverages were provided under incurred loss  retrospectively rated premium plans 
under these plans  we incur insurance expense based upon various rates applied to current payroll costs and sales 
annually  such insurance expense is adjusted by the carrier for loss experience factors subject to minimum and maximum premium calculations 
refunds or additional premiums are estimated and recorded when sufficiently reliable data is available 
we were contingently liable at december  for future retrospective premium adjustments and recorded an estimated liability of approximately  and  related to these contingent claims 
claims exceeding our current expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
reserve for repurchase commitments manufactured housing companies customarily enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions  which provide wholesale floor plan financing to dealers 
a majority of our sales are made to dealers located primarily in the south central and south atlantic regions of the united states pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions 
these agreements generally provide that we will repurchase our new products from the lending institutions in the event of dealer default 
our risk of loss under repurchase agreements is reduced by the following factors sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a relatively large number of independent dealers  the largest of which accounted for approximately of sales in  excluding fema related sales  the price that we are obligated to pay under such repurchase agreements declines based on predetermined amounts over the period of the agreement generally to months  and we historically have been able to resell homes repurchased from lenders 
we apply fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to account for our liability for repurchase commitments 
under the provisions of fin  issuance of a guarantee results in two different types of obligations a non contingent obligation to stand ready to perform under the repurchase commitment accounted for pursuant to fin and a contingent obligation to make future payments under the conditions of the repurchase commitment accounted for pursuant to sfas no 

we review the retail dealers inventory to estimate the amount of inventory subject to repurchase obligation which is used to calculate the fair value of the non contingent obligation for repurchase commitments and the contingent liability based on historical information available at the time 
during the period in which a home is sold inception of a repurchase commitment  we record the greater of these two calculations as a liability for repurchase commitments and as a reduction to revenue 
we estimate the fair value of the non contingent portion of our manufacturer s inventory repurchase commitment under the provisions of fin when a home is shipped to dealers whose floor plan financing includes our repurchase commitment 
the fair value of the inventory repurchase agreement has been estimated on a pooled dealer approach based on the creditworthiness of the independent dealers  as determined by the floor plan institution  and is derived using an income approach 
specifically  the fair value of the inventory repurchase agreement is determined by calculating the net present value of the difference in a the interest cost to carry the inventory over the maximum repurchase liability period at the prevailing floor plan note interest rate and b the interest cost to carry the inventory over the maximum repurchase liability period at the interest rate of a similar type loan without a manufacturer s repurchase agreement in force 
we estimate the contingent obligation to make future payments under our manufacturer s inventory repurchase commitment for the same pool of commitments as used in the fair value calculation above and record the greater of the two calculations 
this sfas no 
contingent obligation is estimated using historical loss factors  including the frequency of repurchases and the losses we experienced for repurchased inventory 
additionally  subsequent to the inception of the repurchase commitment  we evaluate the likelihood that we will be called on to perform under the inventory repurchase commitments 
if it becomes probable that a dealer will default and a sfas no 
loss reserve should be recorded  then such contingent liability is recorded equal to the estimated loss on repurchase 
based on identified changes in dealers financial conditions  we evaluate the probability of default for the group of dealers who are identified at an elevated risk of default and apply a probability of default to the group  based on historical default rates 
in this default probability evaluation  we review repurchase notifications received from floor plan sources and review our dealer inventory for expected repurchase notifications based on various communications from the lenders and the dealers as well as for dealers who  we believe  are experiencing financial difficulty 
our repurchase commitments for the dealers in the category of elevated risk of default are excluded from the pool of commitments used in both of the calculations at and above 
changes in the reserve are recorded as an adjustment to revenue 
following the inception of the commitment  the recorded reserve is reduced over the repurchase period and is eliminated once the dealer sells the home 
the maximum amount for which we are contingently liable under repurchase agreements approximated  and  at december  and  respectively 
we have a reserve for repurchase commitments of  and  
changes in the level of retail inventories in the manufactured housing industry  either up or down  can have a significant impact on our operating results 
the deterioration in the availability of retail financing experienced in recent years  along with significant competition from repossessed homes  extended the inventory adjustment period for excess industry retail inventory levels beyond what was originally expected 
if these trends were to continue  or if retail demand were to significantly weaken  the inventory overhang could result in even greater intense price competition  cause further pressure on profit margins within the industry  and have a material adverse effect on us 
the inventory of cavalier manufactured homes at all retail locations  including company owned retail sales centers  increased in from and declined in from the changes in retail inventory  and corresponding changes in repurchase commitments  have been impacted in the last two years by the leveling of retail inventory with demand and by the industry s involvement in the production of fema related houses that do not carry a repurchase commitment 
in  as fema related production was replaced by traditional dealer purchases that carry inventory repurchase commitments  the contingent portion of our reserve for repurchase commitments increased as we noted in our form k 
impairment of long lived assets since the latter part of  the manufactured housing industry has experienced a downturn in business as discussed above 
due to deteriorating market conditions during this time  we have idled  closed or sold manufactured housing facilities  a portion of our insurance and premium finance business  a portion of our supply operations and under performing retail locations 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including goodwill and other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such assets is less than our carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived assets 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that the fair market values are based primarily on independent appraisals and preliminary or definitive contractual arrangements less costs to dispose 
no impairment charges were recorded in deferred tax asset realization of deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances is largely dependent upon future profitable operations and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
in  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  because we had operated at a cumulative loss in our three most recent calendar years and because we believed difficult competitive and economic conditions might continue for the foreseeable future  a valuation allowance was recorded to fully reserve net deferred tax assets 
as a result of continued improvements in operating performance in and projected income and tax liability for  we reversed a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance realizing  in deferred tax benefits as of december  with the decline in homes shipped in to a year industry low  we re evaluated the need to fully reserve our net deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including anticipated operating results  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  and tax planning strategies 
because we believe challenging industry conditions will extend into and we lack visibility with respect to our results  we have re established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets under the standards of sfas no 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance of  we will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in the future  which may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred income tax assets are realized or the valuation allowances are otherwise no longer required

sudden increases in costs as well as price competition  however  can affect our ability to increase our selling prices

recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  the financial statement effect of a tax position should initially be recognized when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold should initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments  but are not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we purchase retail installment contracts from our dealers  at fixed interest rates  in the ordinary course of business  and periodically resell a majority of these loans to financial institutions under the terms of retail finance agreements 
the periodic resale of installment contracts reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  as the majority of contracts are held for a short period of time 
our portfolio consisted of fixed rate contracts with interest rates generally ranging from to and an average original term of months at december  we estimated the fair value of our installment contracts receivable at  using discounted cash flows and interest rates offered by cis on similar contracts at december  we have one industrial development revenue bond issue that is exposed to interest rate changes
