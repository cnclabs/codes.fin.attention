item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview as of february   we own luxury and upper upscale hotel properties and we are the largest lodging reit in the national association of real estate investment trust s composite index 
a reit is a legal entity that holds real estate interests and  through payments of dividends to stockholders  is permitted to reduce or avoid federal income taxes at the corporate level 
host operates as a self managed and self administered reit and owns approximately of the partnership interests of host hotels resorts  lp  or host lp 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry 
the majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort convention destinations 
the target profile for our portfolio includes luxury and upper upscale hotels in urban and resort convention destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors 
though hotels meeting this target profile will still be subject to competitive pressures  we believe this will allow us to maintain room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors 
we also seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in maximizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements 
our customers the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business  and contract business  which made up approximately  and  respectively  of our business in similar to the majority of the lodging industry  we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient demand broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers and is divided into four key sub categories premium  corporate  special corporate and discount 
overall  business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels  with leisure travelers making up the remainder 
therefore  our business will be more significantly affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand premium sometimes referred to as rack rate  typically consists of rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available 
room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality  weekday vs 
weekend stays 
corporate this is the benchmark rate which a hotel publishes and offers to the general public 
it is typically the second highest category  and is for travelers that do not have access to negotiate or discount rates 
special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel 
these rates are typically negotiated annually  at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate 
discount this encompasses all discount programs  such as aaa and aarp discounts  government per diem  rooms booked through wholesale channels  frequent guest program redemptions  and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel 
group demand represents clusters of guestrooms booked together  usually with a minimum of rooms 
examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion 
group business is segmented into the following three key sub categories association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions 

table of contents corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg  product launches  training programs  contract negotiations  and presentations 
other group business predominately related to social  military  education  religious  fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams  otherwise known as smerf business 
the final category is contract demand  which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates 
contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand 
airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels 
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements under which they typically earn base and incentive management fees related to the revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to operate the property  including purchasing inventory and paying wages  utilities  property taxes and other expenses 
we generally receive a cash distribution  which reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation  from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period  depending on the manager 
hotel revenue is approximately of our total revenue 
the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue of revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie  group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business  which may or may not utilize the hotel s restaurants 
other revenue 
occupancy  the nature of the property ie  resort  etc 
and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf course  spa  telephone  entertainment and other guest services 
hotel operating expenses are approximately of our total operating costs and expenses 
the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses of operating costs and expenses rooms expense 
these costs include housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense 
these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages  as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided 
food and beverage expense 
these expenses primarily include food  beverage and labor costs 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie  catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue 

table of contents of operating costs and expenses hotel departmental expense 
these expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other ancillary revenues such as parking  golf courses  spas  telephones  entertainment and other guest services  as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments  sales and marketing  repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs 
management fees 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue as set forth in our management contracts 
incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed threshold levels established in our management agreements 
other property level expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent and property insurance 
many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change in tandem with changes in revenues at our hotels 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this is a non cash expense that is relatively inflexible and changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of post acquisition capital expenditures 
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statement of operations 
it is also worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items  however  taken separately these costs represent approximately of our total expenses  making wages and benefits the most significant component of our cost structure 
key performance indicators we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business  including revpar  funds from operations ffo per diluted share and hotel adjusted operating profit 
revenue per available room  or revpar  is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
revpar changes driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes driven predominately by average room rate 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in these additional room related costs 
for this reason  while operating profit typically increases when occupancy rises  revpar increases due to higher room rates would have a greater impact on our profitability 
we also use  among other things  ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
see non gaap financial measures ffo per diluted share for further discussion 
another key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit  which is a non gaap measure which we use to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property level profitability 
the comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels 
see non gaap financial measures comparable hotel operating results for further discussion 
each of the non gaap measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit and earnings per share 

table of contents summary of operating results total revenue increased billion  or  to billion for the year  which includes million of revenues for the properties acquired from starwood in april net income increased million to million in net income includes approximately million in gains from the sale of seven properties 
diluted earnings per share increased to 
for our comparable properties  revpar increased due to a increase in average room rates  partially offset by a slight decrease in occupancy 
the improvement in revpar was a result of continuing positive trends in both the economy and industry fundamentals 
the significant improvement in room rates also helped drive an increase in operating margins 
however  the increase in operating margins was partially offset by greater than inflationary increases in the costs of insurance  utilities and employee wages and benefits 
margins were also positively affected by the increase in food and beverage margins as a result of growth in catering and banquet sales 
ffo per diluted share increased  to  for ffo per diluted share was reduced by 
for due to costs associated with refinancing of senior notes  the redemption of preferred stock and non recurring costs associated with the starwood acquisition 
by comparison  ffo per diluted share was reduced by 
for due to costs associated with refinancing and preferred stock transactions in acquisition and disposition activity acquisitions consistent with our acquisition strategy  in april we completed the purchase of domestic and three foreign properties from starwood for approximately billion 
the portfolio included properties in states  washington dc  santiago  chile and warsaw  poland that are represented by premium brands such as westin  sheraton  w  st 
regis  and the luxury collection 
the sheraton warsaw hotel towers was subsequently contributed by us to the european joint venture 
combined with the formation of the european joint venture  which currently owns seven properties  we have significantly expanded our geographic and brand diversity  which we believe should create a strong platform for future growth 
as a result of these transactions  approximately of our budgeted hotel sales will be generated by marriott branded hotels  by ritz carlton hotels and by hyatt hotels  while westin branded hotels will represent and sheraton and w branded hotels  both new brands to our portfolio  will represent and  respectively 
consistent with our previous acquisitions  the starwood properties are primarily located in urban and convention or resort locations and in markets with significant barriers to entry 
in particular  management believes that the european markets are in the early stages of a lodging recovery which should provide the opportunity for additional growth outside of the domestic lodging cycle 
we also continue to pursue single asset acquisitions of luxury and upper upscale hotels where we believe the properties can be acquired at attractive multiples of cash flow and at discounts to replacement cost 
in september  we acquired the room westin kierland resort spa  which includes a hole golf course and a full service spa  for approximately million 
dispositions during  we took advantage of market conditions to dispose of five non core properties  where we believed the potential for revenue growth was lower 
proceeds from these sales were approximately million and were used to repay debt  fund acquisitions  invest in our portfolio or for general corporate purposes 
additionally  we disposed of two core assets  the swiss tel the drake new york and the fort lauderdale marina marriott  which we sold for a total of approximately million and recognized a gain of approximately million 
in these transactions we were able to capitalize on value enhancement opportunities and apply the proceeds towards the acquisition of the starwood portfolio 
in january  we continued to execute on our disposition strategy through the sale of four additional non core properties for approximately million 

table of contents debt and equity activity improving our interest coverage and leverage ratios remains a key management priority 
during  we issued approximately billion in senior notes  assumed or issued million of mortgage debt and drew million on our credit facility 
the proceeds were used to retire  redeem or prepay million of senior notes  million of mortgage debt and approximately million of class c preferred stock 
the remaining proceeds of the debt issuances were used for the asset acquisitions described above  to fund debt prepayment costs and for general corporate purposes 
additionally  we converted to common stock or redeemed for cash the million remaining balance of the convertible subordinated debentures 
overall  our debt balance increased approximately million in we also increased our stockholders equity balance by approximately billion during the year  primarily through the issuance of common stock as part of the acquisition of the starwood portfolio and through the conversion of our convertible subordinated debentures 
as a result of these debt and equity activities and the continued improvement in the cash flow of our hotels  we significantly improved our interest coverage and leverage ratios during outlook management believes that will be another strong year of growth as a result of continued upward trends in operating fundamentals  including the growth of the us economy and strengthening group and transient business travel 
demand continues to improve though it is expected to grow at a slightly slower rate  while strong industry performance has begun to increase the pace of new supply 
however  the majority of new projects scheduled for completion in the near term are concentrated in the economy and mid scale segments  are outside of major urban markets and will have less than rooms 
for example  a recent survey by lodging econometrics indicates that new room supply for luxury and upper upscale hotels in will be less than of all new supply 
further  only of the new supply will be in central business districts  which are our target markets 
supply growth will also continue to be constrained by increasing construction costs and labor market shortages 
as a result  we expect that comparable hotel revpar will increase approximately to for the full year we also expect to see improvements in revpar and operating margins as a result of our significant capital expenditures program at many of our properties  which we believe will enhance their competitive market position and improve their operating performance 
in the near term  some properties may experience temporary business disruption as rooms  common areas and meeting spaces are renovated 
we expect to see improvements in the operations of our hotels as we complete the significant repositioning return on investment projects within our existing portfolio 
operating margin growth will also benefit from the increase in room rate driven growth in  as well as continued improvement in food and beverage revenues associated with the expected growth in group business 
while we expect margins to improve  margin growth will be restrained by continued pressure from above inflationary growth in costs  including wages and benefits  real estate taxes and property insurance 
we intend to declare a regular quarterly dividend of 
in  which will result in an increase over the total dividends declared 
in addition  we intend to declare a special dividend in the fourth quarter based upon our operating performance and the resulting effect on our level of taxable income 
based on the forecasted growth in operations and expected level of capital expenditures  we believe the special dividend will be meaningfully higher than the amount declared in the amount of any dividend will be determined by host s board of directors 
while we believe the trends discussed above create the opportunity for improvements in our business in  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns

table of contents we discuss operating results for our hotels on a comparable basis 
comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared 
comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred significant property damage and business interruption or large scale capital improvements during these periods 
as of december   of our hotels have been classified as comparable hotels 
see comparable hotel operating statistics for a complete description of our comparable hotels 
the following discussion is of the sales results of our comparable hotels considering property type ie urban  suburban  resort convention or airport and geographic region 
we also discuss the sales results of our hotels considering the mix of business ie transient  group or contract 
comparable hotel sales increased to approximately billion for the revenue growth reflects the increase in comparable revpar of  as a result of an increase in average room rates of and a slight decrease in occupancy of percentage points 
the growth in average room rate was driven by a number of positive trends such as strong united states gdp growth  low growth in the supply of new luxury and upper upscale hotels and the strengthening in the group and transient segments of our business 
as a result of these trends  our operators were able to significantly increase average daily room rates and continued to manage the mix of business away from lower rated discount and contract business in favor of higher rated corporate transient and corporate and association group business 
however  this yield management at our hotels did result in fewer occupied rooms and was the primary factor for the slight occupancy decline 
occupancy was also affected by weakness in individual markets and temporary disruption to certain properties due to our capital expenditure program 
for the hotels acquired from starwood that we consolidate  revpar increased when compared to the full year food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels increased  primarily due to increased sales from our catering and banquet business 
growth in sales of our food and beverage operations  which historically represent approximately of our revenues  also positively affected overall operating margins  as our managers continue to shift business from outlets to banquet sales 
food and beverage margins increased percentage points in we expect food and beverage revenue to continue to increase  which should contribute to continued growth in our operating margins 
the increase in sales also is affected by our properties market share as measured by the revpar penetration index 
the revpar penetration index reflects each property s revpar in relation to the revpar for that property s competitive set 
the competitive set for our hotels typically is determined through negotiations between our managers and us as certain termination provisions in our management agreements are based on our hotel s performance against their competitive set 
competitive set determinations are subjective and  as a result  our methodology of determining a hotel s competitive set may differ materially from those used by other owners and or managers 
additionally  revpar penetration index often will shift dramatically upon the addition of a new hotel to the competitive set or upon a change in demand for a particular market  regardless of the hotel s performance 
as a result  we predominantly use revpar penetration index to evaluate the market share of our hotels on an individual basis  as opposed to in the aggregate 
we seek to maintain a revpar penetration index above for all of our properties  which would indicate that a hotel maintains a revpar premium in relation to its competitive set 
currently  approximately three quarters of our properties achieve a revpar penetration index of or higher

table of contents our new england region was the top performing region 
in particular  our downtown boston hotels continued to benefit from very strong group demand 
the dc region was our worst performing region 
comparable hotel revpar in the dc region was negatively affected by the renovations at the jw marriott  washington  dc  which had a significant number of rooms out of service for the first and second quarters of  as well as an overall decrease in congressional activity and a reduction in group business compared to  which included the effect of the presidential inauguration 
increases in comparable hotel revpar in our mountain region were due primarily to a revpar increase at our three comparable hotels in the denver market 
we also experienced revpar growth at our hotels located in the phoenix scottsdale area 
increases in comparable hotel revpar for our mid atlantic region were driven by the performance at our two new york city hotels with comparable hotel revpar growth of 
strong group  transient and international demand has contributed to the performance of the new york city market 
our pacific region benefited from strong revpar growth in the hawaii and san diego markets 
comparable hotel revpar growth in our florida region was primarily due to strong group bookings and improved transient demand at several of our resorts  especially the ritz carlton  naples 
comparable hotel revpar growth for our atlanta region was driven by an increase in room rates of 
the region has benefited from strong in house group and transient demand 
increases in comparable hotel revpar in the north central region were primarily due to an increase in the average room rate and the average occupancy 
the improvement was the result of strong growth across all segments of demand  particularly group demand at our six hotels in the chicago market  which benefited from a significant increase in the number of city wide convention events in comparable hotel revpar increases in our south central region were driven primarily by strong increases in average room rate 
comparable hotel revpar for our international properties increased primarily due to the performance of our four canadian properties 
comparable hotel sales by business mix 
the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business and contract business 
those traveling as part of an organized group  meeting or convention are referred to as group customers 
individual travelers are referred to as transient customers 
based on of our marriott  ritz carlton and starwood hotels for which we have detailed customer demographics  our business in was approximately group based and transient based 
approximately of our business is related to volume contracted business such as airline crews 
in  overall demand was stronger and  therefore  our operators were able to significantly increase average daily room rates  particularly in the corporate transient segments 
overall transient average daily rates increased when compared to last year and our overall group average room rate for these hotels increased almost 
the gap between transient rates and group rates widened in  indicating that pricing power remained strong 
we expect this trend in strong growth in average daily rates to continue in  particularly in our transient business 
rental income 
our rental income represents lease income from our leased hpt properties and three office property leases  as well as lease income from one upper upscale hotel 
the million improvement in rental income primarily is from operations at the leased hpt properties as a result of investments in the properties by the lessor and improvements in the overall economy 

table of contents property level operating costs change in millions rooms food and beverage hotel departmental expenses management fees other property level expenses depreciation and amortization total property level expenses property level operating costs and expenses increased billion  or  to approximately billion for property level operating costs and expenses include approximately million and million for and  respectively  of property level costs associated with hotels acquired in and property level operating costs and expenses exclude the costs for hotels we have sold or classified as held for sale at december   which are included in discontinued operations 
our operating costs and expenses  which are both fixed and variable  are affected by changes in occupancy  inflation and revenues  though the effect on specific costs will differ 
for example  utility costs at our comparable hotels increased 
we expect operating costs to continue to increase in as a result of variable costs increasing with occupancy increases  and certain costs increasing at a rate above inflation  particularly wages and benefits  insurance and real estate taxes 
corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs such as employee stock based compensation expense  travel  corporate insurance  audit fees  building rent and system costs 
corporate expenses increased by million  or  due to an increase in compensation expense based on the strong performance of our stock price and an increase in overall staffing levels  as well as non recurring costs associated with the starwood acquisition of million 
gain on insurance settlement 
the gain on insurance settlement in of million relates to business interruption insurance proceeds received as a result of lost profit at our new orleans marriott following hurricane katrina in august and at five of our hotels located in florida following hurricane wilma in october we received an additional million of business interruption insurance proceeds for the fort lauderdale marina marriott  which is included in income from discontinued operations  as we sold the hotel during the gain on insurance settlement in relates to million of business interruption insurance proceeds for the new orleans marriott 
in addition to the business interruption insurance proceeds  our insurance policy provides us with reimbursement for the replacement cost for the damage done to these assets 
as a result  we have written off the approximate million book value of the damaged assets  which includes certain repair and clean up costs 
the write off of the assets has been completely offset by the establishment of an insurance receivable and  accordingly  there is no effect on the statement of operations 
further  to the extent that our insurance settlement proceeds are in excess of the amounts written off  we will record a gain on insurance settlement in the period that all contingencies are resolved 
to date  we have received approximately million in insurance proceeds related to our property damage claim 
interest income 
interest income increased million  primarily due to an increase in our cash balance and increases in the interest rates earned on cash and restricted cash balances 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million 
the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to a net increase in debt of approximately million and increased rates for our variable rate debt 
the increase was partially offset by a decline from million in to million in for call 
table of contents premiums  accelerated deferred financing costs and original issue discounts and the early termination of our interest rate swap agreements associated with debt prepayments 
in addition  interest expense for includes approximately million of non recurring bridge loan fees and expenses related to the starwood acquisition 
net gains on property transactions 
the gains primarily represent the amortization of deferred gains on the sale of the hpt properties in and in  gains also included the pre tax gain of million on the sale of of our interest in cbm joint venture llc 
gain loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts 
the gain on foreign currency and derivative contracts in is primarily due to the million increase in the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts on two of our canadian hotels 
these agreements were terminated in the fourth quarter of minority interest expense 
as of december   we held of the partnership interests in host lp 
the increase in our minority interest expense for primarily is due to the increase in the net income of host lp  as well as the net income of certain of our consolidated hotel partnerships that are partially owned by third parties 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
our share of losses of affiliates increased by million primarily due to the losses recorded from our investment in the european joint venture of million  which includes our portion of a foreign currency hedge loss of million  as the venture hedged a portion of its initial investment for the acquisition of six of its hotels 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of the results of operations and the gain or loss on disposition of seven hotels sold in  four hotels classified as held for sale as of december  and five hotels sold in for and  revenues for these properties were million and million  respectively  and income before taxes was million  which includes million of business interruption insurance proceeds for the fort lauderdale marina marriott  and million  respectively

our sources of cash are cash from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets  borrowing under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various capital markets 
we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 
cash balances 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  which was an increase of million from december  approximately million of the december  cash balance was used to pay our fourth quarter dividends in january as a result of the current operating environment and the flexibility and capacity provided by our credit facility  we would be comfortable with reducing our cash balances closer to the million to million level that we have historically maintained 
approximately million of mortgage debt was prepaid prior to its maturity in principal amortization of mortgage debt totaled approximately million for approximately million of mortgage debt matures in  million of which was refinanced in the first quarter of with a 
table of contents million  loan that does not require principal amortization 
an additional million of principal amortization is expected in we also expect to repay a mortgage secured by four hotels for million in october  at which time the interest rate on the loan substantially increases and all excess cash flow is used to pay down the mortgage

on december   we borrowed approximately million under our credit facility to retire the series g senior notes 
we repaid million of the draw in january and  as a result  we currently have million of availability under our credit facility

for the hotels included in the initial closing  the total consideration paid by host to starwood and its stockholders included the issuance of billion of equity  shares of host common stock to starwood stockholders  the assumption of million in debt and the cash payment of approximately million  which includes closing costs

host lp is a limited partner and also serves as the general partner of the european joint venture 
the percentage interest of the parties in the european joint venture is for abp  for gic re and for host lp including its limited and general partner interests

we may acquire additional properties through various structures  including transactions involving portfolios  single assets  joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities 
we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods  including proceeds from sales of properties from our existing portfolio  the incurrence of debt  available cash  advances under our credit facility  proceeds from equity offerings of host  or issuance of op units by host lp 
additionally  the number of potential acquirers for individual hotel properties has increased due to the improvement of both the capital markets and the lodging industry and  as a result  the cost of acquiring properties has increased 
debt repayments and refinancings 
we seek to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry  the debt capacity to buy assets in a downturn in the lodging cycle and the ability to continue to pay common stock dividends in the event that operations decline

repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors

senior notes general 
the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issues by host lp  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lp s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp 
the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and currently are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  as well as our credit facility  certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
as with the prior facility  the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above 
restrictive covenants 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture  our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the achievement of an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of at least x by host lp 
effective with the redemption of the series g senior notes in december  host lp is able to make distributions to enable host to pay dividends on its 
table of contents preferred stock under the senior notes indenture when our ebitda to interest coverage ratio is above to this ratio is calculated in accordance with our senior notes indenture and excludes from interest expense items such as interest on our convertible subordinated debentures  call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the calculation is based on our pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions  such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings  as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate values and secured indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets 
so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture  we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture  including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition 
our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters  such as limitations on capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  transactions with affiliates and the incurrence of liens 
exchangeable senior debentures 
on march   we issued million of exchangeable senior debentures and received proceeds of million  net of underwriting fees and expenses and an original issue discount 
these debentures were issued under our senior notes indenture  and are the only series of senior notes that are exchangeable into common stock 
the exchangeable senior debentures mature on april  and are equal in right of payment with all of our unsubordinated debt 
we can redeem for cash all  or part of  the exchangeable senior debentures at any time subsequent to april  upon days notice at the applicable redemption price as set forth in the indenture 
if we elect to redeem the debentures and the trading price of our common stock exceeds the cash redemption price on a per share basis  we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures for common stock rather than receive the cash redemption price 
holders have the right to require us to repurchase the exchangeable senior debentures on april   april  and april  at the issue price 
holders may exchange their exchangeable senior debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions  including at any time at which the closing sale price of the common stock is more than of the exchange price per share  for at least of trading days 
because this condition has currently been satisfied  the exchangeable senior debentures are exchangeable into shares of common stock at a rate of shares for each  of principal amount of the debentures  or a total of approximately million shares  which is equivalent to an exchange price of per share of common stock 
the exchange rate is adjusted under certain circumstances  including the payment of common dividends 
the debentures will remain exchangeable until april  the last day of the current exchange period 
the debentures will remain exchangeable after april   if the trading price of host common stock continues to exceed of the exchange price for out of the trading days during the related exchange period or if other conditions for exchange are satisfied 
credit facility general 
on september   we entered into an amended and restated credit facility 
the credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of million 
the credit facility also includes sub commitments for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million and loans to certain of our canadian subsidiaries in canadian dollars in an aggregate amount of million 
the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity in september we have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met at the time of the initial scheduled maturity 
we also have the option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders  whether or not currently party to the credit facility  commits to be a lender for such amount 
currently  we have approximately million outstanding under our credit facility 
the debt under the amended credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and currently is secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 

table of contents the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters  as noted above 
since we are currently below the x leverage ratio  we have the right to release all pledges and have exercised this right for pledges of capital stock that otherwise would have been required subsequent to october we may in the future exercise this right with pledges in place as of october in the event our leverage ratio subsequently exceeds x for two consecutive quarters  we will be required to reinstate the pledges 
dual tranche structure 
the revolving loan commitment under the amended credit facility is divided into two separate tranches a revolving facility a tranche of million and a revolving facility b tranche of million 
subject to compliance with the facility s financial covenants  amounts available for borrowing under revolving facility a vary depending on our leverage ratio  with million being available when our leverage ratio is less than x  million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x but is less than x  million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x but is less than x  and no amounts being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x 
by contrast  the entire amount of revolving facility b is available for borrowing at any time that our unsecured interest coverage ratio equals or exceeds x and our leverage ratio does not exceed levels ranging from x to x 
specifically  prior to the end of our third quarter of  we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under revolving facility b so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of x  the maximum leverage ratio applicable to revolving facility b is then reduced to x from the end of the third quarter of until the day prior to end of our third quarter of  and is reduced to x thereafter 
financial covenants 
we are subject to different financial covenants depending on whether amounts are borrowed under revolving facility a or revolving facility b  and we are permitted to convert amounts borrowed under either tranche into amounts borrowed under the other tranche 
while the financial covenants applicable under revolving facility a are generally comparable to those contained in our prior facility including covenants for leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage  the financial covenants applicable to revolving facility b are limited to leverage and unsecured interest coverage  and are set at less restrictive levels than the corresponding covenants applicable to revolving facility a 
as a result of this structure  we have gained flexibility to make and maintain borrowings in circumstances where adverse changes to our financial condition could have prohibited the maintenance of borrowings under the prior facility 
the financial covenants for the revolving facility a and revolving facility b do not apply when there are no borrowings under the respective tranche 
hence  so long as there are no amounts outstanding we are not in default of the credit facility if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the amended credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants 
we are in compliance with all our covenants as of december  the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility facility a financial covenant levels year minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio thereafter facility b financial covenant levels quarter minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio maximum leverage ratio to second quarter third quarter to second quarter thereafter 
table of contents interest and fees 
we pay interest on borrowings under the revolving facility a at floating interest rates plus a margin which  in the case of libor based borrowings  ranges from to that is set with reference to our leverage ratio 
borrowings under revolving facility b are subject to a margin that is higher than the corresponding margin applicable to revolving facility a borrowings and 
higher when our leverage ratio is greater than x 
to the extent that amounts under the amended credit facility remain unused  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment 
other covenants 
our amended credit facility imposes restrictions on customary matters that were also restricted in our prior facility  such as limitations on capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  the incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends 
while such restrictions are generally similar to those contained in our prior facility  we have modified certain covenants to become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below x 
in particular  at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures  and the limitations on acquisitions  investments and dividends will be replaced by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of december  mortgage and other debt general 
as of december   we had assets that were secured by mortgage debt 
substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions 
as of december   secured debt represented approximately of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of and an average maturity of years 
certain of these assets are secured by mortgage debt that contains restrictive covenants that require the mortgage servicer or lender to retain and hold in escrow the cash flow after debt service when it declines below specified operating levels 
currently  all of the specified operating levels have been met and  therefore  no cash is being held in escrow under these restrictive covenants

moody s rating on our senior notes debt is ba and our preferred stock is ba fitch s rating on our senior notes debt is bb 
if our operations or our credit ratios were to decline  the ratings on our securities could be reduced 
if we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings  our cost to issue additional senior notes  either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise  or additional preferred stock would likely increase 
dividend policy host is required to distribute at least of its annual taxable income  excluding net capital gain  to its stockholders to qualify as a reit  including taxable income recognized for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash 
funds used by host to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from host lp

as of february   host is the owner of substantially all of the preferred op units and approximately of the common op units 
the remaining of the common op units are held by various third party limited partners 
investors should take into account the minority position in host lp common op units when analyzing common and preferred dividend payments by host to its stockholders  as these holders share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding common and preferred op units 
when host pays a common or preferred dividend  host lp pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred op units 
for example  if host paid a per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on payment of a per unit distribution by host lp to host  as well as to other common op unit holders 
host s current policy on common dividends is generally to distribute of its annual taxable income 
going forward  host intends to pay a regular quarterly dividend of per share  and  in addition  to declare a special dividend during the fourth quarter  the amount of which will vary depending on host s level of taxable income

under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international  hms host and barcel crestline corporation  we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us 
for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a material tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
additionally  under the partnership agreement between host and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by host  as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host 
we do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangements to be material 
tax indemnification agreements 
for reasons relating to federal and state income tax considerations of the former and current owners of five hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
these agreements require that we indemnify the owners for their tax consequences resulting from our selling the hotel or refinancing the mortgage debt during the period under the agreement 
we also have agreed not to sell more than of the original allocated value attributable to a portfolio of additional hotels  or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes 
because the timing of these potential transactions is within our control  we believe that the likelihood of any material indemnification to be remote and  therefore  not material to our financial statements 
on average  these restrictions will generally expire  or cease to be significant  in guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately million as of december  in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which owns and operates a senior living facility 
we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership  but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by barcel crestline corporation  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 
in connection with the sale of two hotels in january  we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately million through the full term of the leases  including renewal options 
we believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote  and in each case  we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel 
information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases  projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total the amounts shown include amortization of principal  debt maturities and estimated interest payments 
interest payments have been included in the long term debt obligations based on the weighted average interest rate for both fixed and variable debt 
for variable rate debt  we have used the applicable percentage interest rate as of december  future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the hpt subleases of approximately million and million  respectively  payable to us under non cancelable subleases 
our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years and some of the amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed 
see capital expenditures 
the amounts shown include deferred management fees 
under terms of our management agreements  we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner s priority to us 
the timing of the payments  if any  is based on future operations  the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel  and  is therefore  not determinable 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates purchase price allocations to hotels 
investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
any remaining unallocated acquisition costs would be treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the 
table of contents remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
impairment testing 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been impaired  whereby  future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the hotel 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge when a property s fair value is less than its net book value 
we test for impairment in several situations  including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  as well as whenever an asset is classified as held for sale or events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotel s net book value may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our hotels  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows holding period expected useful life future capital expenditures fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  assumptions  future changes in economic conditions  or property level results could require us to record additional impairment charges  which would be reflected in operations in the future 
classification of assets as held for sale 
our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable  will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the planned sale will be withdrawn 
this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed  the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
specifically  we will typically classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met our board of directors has approved the sale to the extent the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
to the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
see the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  of consolidated deferred tax assets as of december  the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of derivative contracts 
we had three interest rate swap agreements which were terminated during our interest rate swap agreements were designated as fair value hedges  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also have an interest rate cap agreement that is fair valued each quarter and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
the fair value of the interest rate cap at december  and its effect on net income was immaterial during stock compensation 
we recognize costs resulting from our share based payment transactions in our financial statements over their vesting periods 
we classify share based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity classified awards or liability classified awards 
the classification of our restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is primarily based upon cash settlement options 
equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant 
liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
the value of these restricted stock awards  less estimated forfeitures  is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
all restricted stock awards to senior executives have been classified as liability awards  primarily due to settlement features that allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the statutory minimum withholding 
restricted stock awards to our upper middle management have been classified as equity awards as these awards do not have the optional tax withholding feature 
we utilize a simulation  or monte carlo  model to determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards classified as liability awards 
the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock  risk free interest rates  the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited 
we have recorded approximately million of compensation expense related to our share based payment awards during consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
currently  we have investments in entities that own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting 
these entities are considered to be voting interest entities 
the debt on these investments is non recourse to us and the effect of their 
table of contents operations on our results of operations is not material 
while we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures  if we were required to do so  then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements

fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return

comparable hotels operating statistics we discuss operating results for our hotels on a comparable basis 
comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared 
comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred significant property damage and business interruption or large scale capital improvements during these periods 
the following discussion is of the sales results of our comparable hotels considering the mix of business ie transient  group or contract  property type ie urban  suburban  resort convention or airport and geographic region 
see comparable hotel operating statistics for a complete description of our comparable hotels and further detail on these classifications 
we also discuss the sales results of our hotels considering the mix of business ie  transit  group or contract 
we present certain operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues  expenses and adjusted operating profit for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
we define our comparable hotels as properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results  whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption  or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared 
of the hotels that we owned on december   have been classified as comparable hotels 
the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december  are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods marriott mountain shadows resort and golf club closed september and sold in the first quarter of  the westin kierland resort spa acquired in september  the hotels acquired from starwood on april  that we consolidated as of december  three of which were sold in the first quarter of  newport beach marriott hotel spa major renovation completed december hyatt regency washington on capitol hill  washington  dc acquired in september  atlanta marriott marquis major renovation started august  and new orleans marriott property damage and business interruption from hurricane katrina in august 
additionally  the operating results of the hotels we disposed of in and also are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein 
moreover  because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties  they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments 

table of contents we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type 
these divisions are generally consistent groupings generally recognized in the lodging industry 
geographic regions consist of the following only states in which we own hotels are listed pacific california  hawaii  oregon and washington  mountain arizona and colorado  north central illinois  indiana  michigan  minnesota  missouri and ohio  south central louisiana  tennessee and texas  new england connecticut  massachusetts and new hampshire  mid atlantic pennsylvania  new jersey and new york  dc metro maryland  virginia and washington  dc  atlanta georgia and north carolina  florida florida  and international canada  mexico and chile 
property types consist of the following urban hotels located in primary business districts of major cities  suburban hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets  resort convention hotels located in resort convention destinations such as florida  hawaii and southern california  and airport hotels located at or near airports 
reporting periods for consolidated statement of operations 
the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott  the manager of a significant percentage of our properties  uses a year ending on the friday closest to december and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt and starwood  report results on a monthly basis 
host  as a reit  is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott but our fourth quarter ends on december and our full year results  as reported in our statement of operations  always includes the same number of days as the calendar year 
two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for  and note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations 
start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter january march january march january march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september december september december september december 
table of contents while the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott  another consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us 
hence  the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately based on total revenues of our hotels 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january  february  second quarter march to may  third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december 
while this does not affect full year results  it does affect the reporting of quarterly results 
for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results 
in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations  our hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and our comparable hotel results are always reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott for our marriott managed hotels 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year except in the case of fourth quarters comprised of seventeen weeks such as fiscal year versus sixteen weeks 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results may differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein 
results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations

they are as follows i funds from operations ffo per diluted share  and ii comparable hotel operating results 
the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ffo per diluted share we present ffo per diluted share as a non gaap measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate ffo per diluted share for a given operating period as our ffo defined as set forth below for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities  including the payment of preferred stock dividends  in accordance with nareit guidelines 

table of contents we believe that ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits  even though ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we calculate ffo per diluted share  in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation  capital expenditures and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  ffo per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  ffo per diluted share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to our stockholders benefit

comparable hotel operating results we present certain operating results for our hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses  and adjusted operating profit  on a comparable hotel  or same store basis as supplemental information for investors 
our comparable hotel operating results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions  significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods 
we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization  because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the majority of our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate 
we use some derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
the table below provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
expected maturity date total fair value thereafter in millions liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate variable rate average interest rate total debt as of december   approximately of our debt bears interest at fixed rates 
this debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in interest rates 
our mortgage on the jw marriott  washington  dc and our credit facility are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the interest rate on our credit facility is based on a spread over libor  ranging from to 
there was million outstanding on our credit facility at december   million of which was repaid in january in august  we exercised our option to extend the million mortgage on the jw marriott  washington  dc  for one year through september additionally  we purchased an interest rate cap that caps the floating interest rate of the loan at through september the cap represents a derivative that is marked to market each period and the gains and losses from changes in the market value of the cap are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts 
the fair value of the interest rate cap was immaterial at december  during the fourth quarter of  we terminated our interest rate swap agreements we had entered into in conjunction with our series g and i senior notes 
under the agreements  we received fixed rate payments and paid floating rate payments 
we designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for both financial reporting and tax purposes and the amounts paid or received under the swap agreements were recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
in connection with the redemption of the series g and series i senior notes  we terminated the related interest rate swap agreements and recorded losses on the termination of the related debt instrument which has been included in interest expense 
the swaps were terminated at a cost equivalent to their fair value at the respective termination dates  or approximately million for the series i senior notes swap on december  and approximately million for the series g senior notes swaps on december  the fair values of the series g interest rate swap and the series i interest rate swaps were million and million  respectively  at december  if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by basis points  the change in interest expense would change future earnings and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis 

table of contents exchange rate sensitivity as we have non us operations specifically  the ownership of hotels in canada  mexico  chile and our european joint venture  currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business 
to manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non us hotels  where possible  we may enter into forward or option contracts 
the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into in the past were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes 
as of december   we have no outstanding foreign currency contracts
