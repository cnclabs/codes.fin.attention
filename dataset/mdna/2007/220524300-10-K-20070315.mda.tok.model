item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes related thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  amounts received for upfront technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of committed services or performance  if such arrangements require our on going services or performance 
we record grant revenues as we incur expenses related to the grant projects 
all amounts received under collaborative research agreements or research grants are nonrefundable  regardless of the success of the underlying research 
revenues from milestone payments are recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a comparable level to that before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached consensus on issue eitf issue addresses the accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  issue requires the recognition of revenue from milestone payments over the remaining minimum period of performance obligations 
as required  we apply the principles of issue to multiple element agreements that we enter into or modify after july  employee stock options and stock based compensation as required  as of january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
prior periods were not restated 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
according to apb  no compensation expense is recognized since the exercise price of our stock 
table of contents options generally equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
we transitioned to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  by utilizing statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we disclosed the effects of stock based employee compensation on reported net income or loss and earnings or loss per share in the footnotes to our annual and interim financial statements 
given that we previously followed apb and sfas in accounting for our employee stock options  the impact of adopting the expense recognition requirements of sfas r was significant to our results of operations  but not our financial position 
our net loss for the year ended december  includes approximately  of non cash stock based employee compensation costs 
for the years ended december  and  our net loss includes approximately  and  of non cash stock based employee compensation costs  respectively 
for the six months ended december  and  our net loss includes approximately  and  of non cash stock based employee compensation costs  respectively 
for the year ended june   our net loss includes approximately  of non cash stock based employee compensation costs 
in accordance with sfas and eitf issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods and services  stock options and warrants issued to consultants and other non employees as compensation for services to be provided to us are accounted for based upon the fair value of the services provided or the estimated fair market value of the option or warrant  whichever can be more clearly determined 
we recognize this expense over the period the services are provided 
registration payment arrangements in connection with prior private placements of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  we entered into agreements that committed us to timely register the shares underlying the issued warrants 
those registration agreements specified potential cash penalties if we did not timely register the related shares with the securities and exchange commission 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock  when the potential cash penalties were included in registration payment arrangements  we recorded the estimated fair value of the warrants as a liability  with an offsetting reduction to additional paid in capital received from the private placement 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated fair value of the warrants was re measured at each reporting date and on the date of effectiveness of the related registration statement  with the increase in fair value recorded as other expense in our statement of operations 
as of the effectiveness of the registration statement  the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital  evidencing the non impact of these adjustments on our financial position and business operations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp eitf no 
 accounting for registration payment arrangements 
this fsp specifies that companies that enter into agreements to register securities will be required to recognize a liability if a payment to investors for failing to fulfill the agreement is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
this accounting differs from the guidance in eitf  which required a liability to be recognized and measured at fair value  regardless of probability 
eitf is effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that we enter into or modify after the date of issuance of this fsp 
for our registration payment arrangements and financial instruments subject to those arrangements that were entered prior to the issuance of this fsp  the guidance will be effective beginning january  
table of contents transition to eitf is to be achieved by reporting a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
for purposes of measuring the cumulative effect adjustment related to the recognition of a contingent liability  we will evaluate whether the transfer of consideration under our registration payment arrangements is probable and can be reasonably estimated as of the january  adoption date 
given that we do not deem the transfer of consideration under our existing registration payment arrangements as probable as of december   we do not anticipate recording a cumulative effect adjustment in connection with the adoption of this fsp 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as reported on our current report on form k dated november   we changed our fiscal year from june to december  implementing such change for the six months ended december  results of operations general in january  we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive worldwide license agreement with nv organon organon  a pharmaceutical business unit of akzo nobel 
the agreement will allow organon to develop and commercialize our proprietary ampakine technology for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression 
in connection with the agreement  we received a  up front licensing payment and research support payments of approximately  per year for two years 
the agreement with organon also includes milestone payments based upon clinical development  plus royalty payments on worldwide sales 
through december   we have received milestone payments totaling  under the agreement with organon 
in october  we entered into a research collaboration agreement and an exclusive license agreement with les laboratoires servier servier 
the license agreement will allow servier to develop and commercialize select ampakine compounds for the treatment of i declines in cognitive performance associated with aging  ii neurodegenerative diseases and iii anxiety disorders 
the indications covered include  but are not limited to  alzheimer s disease  mild cognitive impairment  sexual dysfunction  and the dementia associated with multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
in early december  we terminated the research collaboration with servier and as a result the worldwide rights for the ampakine technology for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases were returned to us  other than for compounds which may be selected by servier for commercialization 
we currently are having discussions with various large pharmaceutical research and development organizations regarding possible broad collaborations for the development of our high impact ampakine technology 
the agreements with servier  as amended to date  include a nonrefundable up front fee of  and research support payments of  per year through early december subject to us providing agreed upon levels of research personnel 
the amount of research support was subject to annual adjustment based upon the increase in the us department of labor s consumer price index 
during the year ended december   our research revenues from the servier agreements were approximately  the agreements also include potential milestone payments  plus royalty payments on sales in licensed territories 

table of contents in october  servier agreed to provide us with  of additional research support  in exchange for rights to our ampakine compounds for the potential treatment of anxiety disorders in servier s licensed territories 
the  was paid in quarterly installments of  over a two year period  ending in september from inception february  through december   we sustained losses approximating  due to projected fluctuations in funding  continuing losses are likely over the next several years  as our ongoing operating expenses will only be offset  if at all  by possible milestone payments from our agreements with servier and organon  or under planned strategic alliances that we are seeking with other pharmaceutical companies for the clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of our products 
the nature and timing of payments to us under the servier and organon agreements or other planned strategic alliances  if and when entered into  are likely to significantly affect our operations and financing activities and to produce substantial period to period fluctuations in reported financial results 
over the longer term  we will require successful commercial development of our products by servier  organon  or our other prospective partners to attain sustained profitable operations from royalties or other product based revenues 
we believe that inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on our ongoing operations to date 
years ended december  and for the fiscal year ended december   our net loss of approximately  compared to a net loss of approximately  for the prior year 
revenues for the fiscal year ended december  decreased by to approximately  from approximately  reported in the prior year due to decreased research revenues from our research collaboration agreement with servier 
at our request  the collaboration with servier ended in early december research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended december  increased to approximately  from approximately  or by  compared to the corresponding prior year period as a result of increased non cash stock compensation charges related to our required adoption of sfas r as of january   and the recording of expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their fair values 
non cash stock compensation charges accounted for approximately  or  of the increase in expense for the year ended december  preclinical development expenses for the fiscal year ended december  include between  and  for studies initiated to address the clinical hold on our ampakine cx by the fda 
the fda placed the clinical hold on cx in late march due to concerns over preclinical animal data 
we submitted a response to the fda in early september and the fda removed the clinical hold in early october in agreeing to the removal of the hold  we committed to an fda specified dose range for cx these dose limitations delayed our planned clinical trials with cx in adhd 
we have generated substantial data from additional toxicology studies over the past several months that demonstrate that the toxicological issues previously identified seem to occur postmortem and are directly related to the fixative interaction with the cells as they die 
we plan to submit such data to the fda in march to mutually determine if we may perform clinical investigations at higher doses of the compound 

table of contents excluding the non cash stock compensation charges discussed above  our total research and development expenses for the year ended december  were consistent with those for the prior year with amounts related to addressing the clinical hold on cx offset by decreased clinical development expenses

we continue to receive approximately  of annual research revenues under our october collaborative research agreement with servier  as amended to date 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended december  increased to approximately  from approximately  or by  compared to the corresponding prior year period 
most of the increase reflects expenses incurred for preclinical and clinical development of the ampakine compounds  including ampakine cx  which entered three phase iia clinical trials during in adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease and in patients subjected to shift work schedules with minimal recovery sleep times 
expenses for the fiscal year ended december  also include costs for additions to our research staff and an increase in sponsored research at academic laboratories 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december  increased to approximately  from approximately  or by  from the prior year period 
most of the increased expenses reflect fees related to preparing for our assessment of our internal control system as of december   as required by the sarbanes oxley act of net interest income increased in fiscal year due to an increase in cash available for investing following our net proceeds of approximately  from the private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock in december other expenses for the years ended december  and represent non cash charges for the change in estimated value of warrants issued in connection with our private equity financings in december and january  respectively  as explained more fully in note to the financial statements

excluding these non cash stock compensation charges  general and administrative expenses for the six months ended december  increased to approximately  from approximately  or by compared to the corresponding prior year period 
expenses for the prior year period reflected cost reductions in an effort to conserve cash prior to the private placement of common stock in august specifically  these cost reductions included the acceptance of stock options in lieu of a portion of base salary by three executive officers during the months of july and august  as initially implemented in february additionally  in september  the chief executive officer accepted stock options in lieu of his entire base salary  as previously reduced  for the months of may through august resultant salary expenses during the six months ended december  reflected the non payment of his salary for the months of july and august and the reversal of his earlier accrued salary expenses for the months of may and june options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock were issued to the executive officers in connection with the waived amounts during july and august  and the waived salary for the chief executive officer from may through august the board of directors also waived all cash payments of director compensation for board meetings held during calendar year  which contributed to the decreased administrative expenses for the prior year period 
in lieu of those payments  options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock were issued to non employee directors as of the date of the annual meeting of stockholders 
net interest income for the six months ended december  increased to approximately  from approximately  for the corresponding prior year period due to an increase in cash available for investing from our private placement in january other income for the six months ended december  represents the change in estimated value of warrants issued in connection with the private equity financing in december  as explained more fully in note to the financial statements

research and development expenses for the year ended december  of approximately  compared to research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  of approximately  representing an increase of 
the increase mostly resulted from charges incurred to develop the second generation ampakine compound  cx  which entered phase i human clinical trials in may the increase for the year ended december  also reflected increased personnel related expenses  including amounts to expand our clinical staff 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  of approximately  compared to general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  of approximately  representing a decrease of 
the decrease resulted from non cash stock compensation charges during the fiscal year ended june  related to the estimated fair value for the vesting of warrants issued with a professional services agreement

liquidity and capital resources under the agreements signed with servier in october  as amended to date  the collaborative research phase of the agreement ended in early december  but  if servier selects compounds for further development and commercialization  we may receive milestone payments based upon successful clinical development of the licensed compounds and royalties on sales in licensed territories 
under the terms of the agreement with organon  we may receive additional milestone payments based on clinical development of the licensed technology and ultimately  royalties on worldwide sales

commitments for preclinical and clinical development expenses approximate  all of which is payable within the next twelve months 
in june  we received  from the institute for the study of aging the institute  a non profit foundation supported by the estee lauder trust 
the advance partially offset our limited costs for our testing in patients with mild cognitive impairment that we conducted with our partner  servier 
provided that we comply with the conditions of the funding agreement  including the restricted use of the amounts received  repayment of the advance will not be required unless we enter an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical trials for alzheimer s disease 
upon such potential clinical trials  repayment would include interest computed at a rate equal to one half of the prime lending rate 
in lieu of cash  in the event of repayment the institute may elect to receive the balance of outstanding principal and accrued interest as shares of our common stock 
the conversion price for such form of repayment shall initially equal per share  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 

table of contents the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap other contractual obligations total staffing as of december   we had full time employees and one part time employee 
we do not anticipate significant increases in the number of our full time employees within the coming year 
plant and equipment we expect that we will require modest investments in plant and equipment within the coming year 
outlook we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the net proceeds from our completed offering of common stock and warrants in january will be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements into additional funds will be required to continue operations beyond that time 
we may receive additional milestone payments from the organon and servier agreements  but there is no assurance that we will receive such milestone payments within the desired timeframe  or at all 
we may also receive funds from the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
as of december   warrants to purchase up to approximately million shares of our common stock were outstanding 
in connection with our completed offering in january  we issued additional warrants to purchase up to approximately million shares of our common stock 
if all currently outstanding warrants are fully exercised  of which there can be no assurance  such exercise would provide approximately  of additional capital 
see risk factors risks related to our business we will need additional capital in the future and  if it is not available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may need to scale back our research and development efforts and may be unable to continue our business operations 
in order to provide for our longer term spending requirements  we are presently seeking collaborative or other arrangements with larger pharmaceutical companies 
under these agreements  we intend that such companies would provide additional capital to us in exchange for exclusive or non exclusive license or other rights to certain of the technologies and products we are developing 
competition for such arrangements is intense  with a large number of biopharmaceutical companies 
table of contents attempting to secure alliances with more established pharmaceutical companies 
although we have been engaged in discussions with candidate companies  there is no assurance that an agreement or agreements will arise from these discussions in a timely manner  or at all  or that revenues that may be generated thereby will offset operating expenses sufficiently to reduce our short and longer term funding requirements 
because there is no assurance that we will secure additional corporate partnerships  we may raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities 
there is no assurance that funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if equity securities are issued to raise additional funds  dilution to existing stockholders may result 
our proposed products are in the preclinical or early clinical stage of development and will require significant further research  development  clinical testing and regulatory clearances 
they are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies 
these risks include the possibilities that any or all of the proposed products will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances  that the proposed products  although effective  will be uneconomical to market  that third parties may now or in the future hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing them  or that third parties will market superior or equivalent products 
accordingly  we are unable to predict whether our research and development activities will result in any commercially viable products or applications 
further  due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained  we do not expect to be able to commercialize any therapeutic drug for at least five years  either directly or through our prospective corporate partners or licensees 
there can be no assurance that our proposed products will prove to be safe or effective or receive regulatory approvals that are required for commercial sale 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on our marketable securities and borrowing arrangement 
all investments in marketable securities are entered into for purposes other than trading 
we are not subject to risks from currency rate fluctuations as we do not typically conduct transactions in foreign currencies 
in addition  we do not utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from financial instruments entered into in the normal course of business 
certain of our financial instruments are fixed rate  short term investments in government and corporate notes and bonds  which are available for sale and have been marked to market in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the investments  however  because these financial instruments are considered available for sale  all such changes are reflected in the financial statements in the period affected 
we manage interest rate risk on our investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with our cash requirements 
as of december   our investment portfolio had a carrying amount of approximately  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the resulting decline in the fair value of fixed rate bonds held within our portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our borrowing consists solely of our advance from the institute  which is subject to potential repayment in the event that we enter an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical testing as a potential treatment for alzheimer s disease 
potential repayment would include interest accruing at a discount to 
table of contents the prime lending rate 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of such debt  but  based upon historical activity  such changes are not expected to have a material impact on earnings or cash flows 
as of december   the principal and accrued interest of the advance amounted to approximately
