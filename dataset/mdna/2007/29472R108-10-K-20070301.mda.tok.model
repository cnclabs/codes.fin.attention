accomplishments approved the sale of thousand trails to privileged access 
privileged access is owned by an experienced industry veteran  joe mcadams  the former ceo of affinity group  inc with over years experience in the rv industry 
acquired membership campground properties which have been leased to privileged access opening up additional access along the east coast for the privileged access members 
acquired our outside joint venture partners interest in properties containing over  sites  primarily in the important markets of arizona and florida 
first year since where our manufactured home properties owned year over year finished the year with a higher number of occupied sites than where we started the year 
raised annual dividend to per share in  up from per share in successfully refinanced maturing lines of credit and term loan with favorable terms and an increased borrowing capacity 
overview and outlook occupancy in our properties as well as our ability to increase rental rates directly affect revenues 
our revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting our sites on a long term basis 
we have approximately  annual sites  approximately  seasonal sites  which are leased to customers generally for to months  and approximately  transient sites  occupied by customers who lease sites on a short term basis 
we expect to service over  customers with these transient sites 
however  we consider this revenue stream to be our most volatile 
it is subject to weather conditions  gas prices  and other factors affecting the marginal rv customer s vacation and travel preferences 
finally  we have approximately  membership sites for which we currently receive ground rent of approximately million annually 
this rent is classified in income from other investments  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we also have interests in properties containing approximately  sites for which revenue is classified as equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations

supplemental property disclosure we provide the following disclosures with respect to certain assets sunshine key sunshine key is a site lifestyle oriented resort property containing a slip marina located in the florida keys 
the property is an individual acre island 
we purchased sunshine key for approximately million in february as part of a larger portfolio 
in and  the property generated approximately million and million  in income from its property and home sales operations  respectively 
sunshine key is owned by a taxable reit subsidiary 
subject to certain provisions  there are rights to redevelop the property into attached hotel units  detached hotel units park models and rv sites 

table of contents we believe that because of the size  quality and location of sunshine key  it represents an irreplaceable asset and therefore  would not normally be considered for sale 
however  based on unsolicited purchase inquiries  we determined that a sale may be beneficial if we could defer the gain on sale and reinvest the proceeds from the sale into a diversified portfolio of properties meeting our long term investment criteria  or if we could significantly increase cash flow from the property by participating in a transaction with a developer where we could retain an interest in the property through a ground lease structure 
in november  we entered into a contract to sell sunshine key 
at the time  we were negotiating for the acquisition of a portfolio that we believed would be an appropriate alternative use of the capital gained from the sale 
a provision of the contract allowed us to terminate the contract through june to the extent we were unable to find appropriate alternative investments 
discussions with respect to a potential replacement portfolio did not lead to a transaction and we communicated such to the potential acquirer of sunshine key 
in response  the potential acquirer discussed potential alternative transactions with us including  among others the sale of the property at an increased price  and entering into a long term ground lease transaction 
after consideration  we exercised our right to terminate the contract 
the purchase price of the property under the contract was million

long lived assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 we allocate the purchase price of properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values

we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  including our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we use a year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements  a ten to fifteen year estimated life for building upgrades and a three to seven year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life

inflation substantially all of the leases at the properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases  where justified by the market  as each lease matures

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo  as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
ffo is defined as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates 
the primary market risk we face is long term indebtedness  which bears interest at fixed and variable rates 
the fair value of our long term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately or approximately billion of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates  which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures 
for each increase in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
for each decrease in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
at december   approximately or approximately million of our outstanding debt was short term and at variable rates 
earnings are affected by increases and decreases in market interest rates on this debt
