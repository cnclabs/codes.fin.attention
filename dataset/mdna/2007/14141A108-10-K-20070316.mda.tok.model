the terms the company  us  we and our refer to cardiac science corporation and our majority owned subsidiaries 
business overview cardiac science corporation was incorporated in delaware on february  as csq holding company to effect the business combination of quinton cardiology systems  inc quinton and cardiac science  inc csi  which we refer to as the merger transaction 
the merger transaction was consummated on september  in connection with the merger transaction  the outstanding shares of common stock of quinton and csi were cancelled and stockholders of quinton and csi were issued common stock of cardiac science corporation in consideration of their shares of quinton and csi common stock 
stockholders of quinton received share of our common stock for each common share of quinton held  representing approximately of our total outstanding common stock as of the date of closing  and holders of csi common stock received share of our common stock for each common share of csi held  which  together with  shares of our common stock issued to the holders of senior notes and related warrants of csi in connection with the merger transaction  represented approximately of our total outstanding common stock as of the date of closing 
in addition  we assumed each outstanding option and other warrant to purchase common stock issued by quinton and csi 
for accounting purposes  the merger transaction was treated as an acquisition by quinton of csi as of september  since we are deemed to be the successor to quinton for accounting purposes  our consolidated financial statements represent the historical statements of quinton and include csi s results of operations since september  all share and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the conversion of quinton shares into cardiac science corporation shares at the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement 
we develop  manufacture and market a family of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic cardiology devices and systems  including automated external defibrillators aeds  electrocardiographs  stress test systems  holter monitoring systems  hospital defibrillators  cardiac rehabilitation telemetry systems  patient monitor defibrillators and cardiology data management systems 
we also sell a variety of related products and consumables and provide a comprehensive portfolio of training  maintenance and support services 
we market our products under the burdick  powerheart and quinton brand names 
critical accounting estimates and policies to prepare financial statements that conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must select and apply accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents critical accounting estimates there are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we reasonably could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
stock based compensation 
as of january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating future volatility  expected term and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
purchase price allocations 
in connection with the merger transaction in september  we have allocated the purchase price plus transaction costs and the fair value of liabilities assumed to the estimated fair values of csi assets acquired 
the purchase price allocation estimates were made based on our estimates of fair values 
had these estimates been different  reported amounts allocated to assets and liabilities and results of operations subsequent to the acquisitions could be materially impacted 
under the purchase method of accounting  the total estimated purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the merger transaction  based on their fair values as of the closing date 
the excess of purchase price over the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired net of liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill 
valuation specialists have conducted valuations in order to assist management in determining the fair values of the identifiable intangible and certain tangible assets acquired 
the work performed by valuation specialists has been considered in management s estimates of fair values 
the initial allocations of purchase cost were recorded at fair value based upon the best information available to management and were finalized by september  with the exception of income taxes 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable represent a significant portion of our assets 
we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
we analyze historical write offs  changes in our internal credit policies and customer concentrations when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
different estimates regarding the collectability of accounts receivable may have a material impact on the timing and amount of reported bad debt expense and on the carrying value of accounts receivable 
inventories 
inventories represent a significant portion of our assets 
we value inventories at the lower of cost  on an average cost basis  or market 
we regularly perform a detailed analysis of our inventories to determine whether adjustments are necessary to reduce inventory values to estimated net realizable value 
we consider various factors in making this determination  including the salability of individual items or classes of items  recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions and general economic conditions 
different estimates regarding the net realizable value of inventories could have a material impact on our reported net inventory and cost of sales  and thus could have a material impact on the financial statements as a whole 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in connection with acquisitions of our medical treadmill product line  burdick and csi 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  for each reporting unit identified for purposes of accounting for goodwill 
a reporting unit represents a portion of our business for which we regularly review certain discrete financial information and operational results 
we have determined that we have two reporting units  consisting of our general cardiology products  which include our product service business  and the shanghai quinton joint venture  both of which operate in the cardiology market and have similar economic and operating characteristics 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include 
table of contents estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit  and potentially result in recognition of an impairment of goodwill  which would be reflected as a loss on our statement of operations and as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill 
we performed a test for goodwill impairment at september  based on the decline in our stock price which we considered a trigger event in accordance with sfas we also performed a test for goodwill impairment at november  in accordance with our policy for performing this test annually 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of either analysis 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of trade names  developed technology and customer relationships  all of which were acquired in our acquisition of burdick in and the merger transaction with csi in we use our judgment to estimate the fair value of each of these intangible assets 
our judgment about fair value is based on our expectation of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
we also use our judgment to estimate the useful lives of each intangible asset 
we believe the burdick and cardiac science trade names have indefinite lives and  accordingly  we do not amortize the trade names 
we evaluate this conclusion annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired and make a judgment about whether there are factors that would limit our ability to benefit from the trade name in the future 
if there were such factors  we would start amortizing the trade name over the expected remaining period in which we believed it would continue to provide benefit 
with respect to our developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets  we also evaluate the remaining useful lives annually 
we periodically evaluate whether our intangible assets are impaired 
for our trade names  this evaluation is performed annually  or more frequently if events occur that suggest there may be an impairment loss  and involves comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of fair value 
for our developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets  this evaluation would be performed if events occur that suggest there may be an impairment loss 
if we conclude that any of our intangible assets is impaired  we would record this as a loss on our statement of operations and as a reduction to the intangible asset 
valuation of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and intangible assets subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized on our statement of operations and as a reduction to value of the asset group on our balance sheet if it is concluded that the fair value of the asset group is less than its carrying value 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
warranty 
we provide warranty service covering the systems we sell 
we estimate and accrue for future costs of providing warranty service  which relate principally to the hardware components of the systems  when the systems are sold 
our estimates are based in part on our warranty claims history and our cost to perform warranty service 
differences could result in the amount of the recorded warranty liability and cost of sales if we made different judgments or used different estimates 
deferred tax assets and income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes 
this process involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income 
if required  we will recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents litigation and other contingencies 
we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses related to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  we will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to these contingencies 
a loss contingency  to be recorded as an expense  must generally be both probable and measurable 
restructuring costs 
our merger transaction with csi caused excess facilities and redundant employee positions 
in we recorded an estimated restructuring accrual of  in connection with the merger transaction 
determining the necessary restructuring accrual required us to estimate future sublease income for vacated excess facilities 
software revenue recognition 
we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
customers may receive certain elements of our products over a period of time 
these elements include post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements on a when and if available basis  the fair value of which is recognized over the product s estimated life cycle 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
sales returns 
the company provides a reserve against revenue for estimated product returns 
the amount of this reserve is evaluated quarterly based upon historical trends 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of hardware products is generally recognized when title transfers to the customer  typically upon shipment 
some of our customers are distributors that sell goods to third party end users 
except for certain identified distributors where collection may be contingent on distributor resale  we recognize revenue on sales of products made to distributors when title transfers to the distributor and all significant obligations have been satisfied 
in making a determination of whether significant obligations have been met  we evaluate any installation or integration obligations to determine whether those obligations are inconsequential or perfunctory 
in cases where the remaining installation or integration obligation is not determined to be inconsequential or perfunctory  we defer the portion of revenue associated with the fair value of the installation and integration obligation until these services have been completed 
distributors do not have price protection and generally do not have product return rights  except in cases upon termination of the distributor agreement or if product is defective 
for certain identified distributors where collection may be contingent on the distributor s resale  revenue recognition is deferred and recognized on a sell through or cash basis 
the determination of whether sales to distributors are contingent on resale is subjective because we must assess the financial wherewithal of the distributor to pay regardless of resale 
for sales to distributors  we consider several factors  including past payment history  where available  trade references  bank account balances  dun bradstreet reports and any other financial information provided by the distributor  in assessing whether the distributor has the financial wherewithal to pay regardless of  or prior to  resale of the product and that collection of the receivable is not contingent on resale 
we offer limited volume price discounts and rebates to certain distributors 
volume price discounts are on a per order basis based on the size of the order and are netted against the revenue recorded at the time of shipment 
we have no arrangements that provide for volume discounts based on meeting certain quarterly or annual purchase levels 
rebates are paid quarterly or annually and are accrued for as incurred 
with respect to arrangements where software is considered more than incidental to the product  the vendor specific objective evidence of undelivered support is deferred and the residual fair value of delivered software is recognized 
revenue from software implementation services is recognized as the services are provided based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
when significant implementation activities are required  we 
table of contents recognize revenue from software and services upon installation 
we occasionally sell software and hardware upgrades on a stand alone basis 
we consider program management packages and training and other services as separate units of accounting and apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf when sold with an aed based on the fact that the items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and could be acquired from another vendor 
fair value is determined to be the price at which they are sold to customers on a stand alone basis 
training revenue is deferred and recognized at the time the training occurs 
aed program management services revenue  pursuant to agreements that exist with some customers pursuant to annual or multi year terms  are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the related contract period 
we offer optional extended service contracts to customers 
fair value is determined to be the price at which they are sold to customers on a stand alone basis 
service contract revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the extended service contracts  which generally begin after the expiration of the original warranty period 
for services performed  other than pursuant to warranty and extended service contract obligations  revenue is recognized when the service is performed and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
accounting for stock based compensation 
prior to the january  adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations 
accordingly  because the stock option grant price equaled the market price on the date of grant  and any purchase discounts under our stock purchase plans were within statutory limits  no compensation expense was recognized by for stock based compensation 
as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  stock based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
effective january  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  and applied the provisions of securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated financial statements for granted stock options and for expense related to the employee stock purchase plan espp  since the related purchase discounts exceeded the amount allowed under sfas r for non compensatory treatment 
compensation expense recognized included the estimated expense for stock options granted on and subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and the estimated expense for the portion vesting in the period for options granted prior to  but not vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas further  as required under sfas r  forfeitures are estimated for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
compensation expense for non vested stock awards is based on the market price on the grant date and is recorded equally over the vesting period 
results for prior periods have not been restated  as provided for under the modified prospective transition method 
prior year misstatements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november   we recorded the impact of prior year misstatements in beginning accumulated deficit for see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further discussion 
results of operations overview of results revenues for were million  with net income of  the following developments during were key for our business we generated solid revenue growth in our aed products and significant cash flow company wide 

table of contents we successfully completed substantially all integration activities on schedule and as planned for a significant merger between quinton and csi 
we laid the groundwork for future growth by consolidating all of our administrative and customer service functions in washington state and consolidating substantially all of our us manufacturing into a single location in wisconsin 
we released updates to our product lines in a number of key areas  including a web enabled version of our pyramis cardiology management system and aeds with enhanced cpr prompting features 
we obtained approval from the japanese ministry of health for a biphasic private labeled version of our powerheart g and  consequently  were able to regain sales momentum for our aed products in japan 
looking forward we expect continued revenue growth in the foreseeable future 
we expect modest growth  over time  in our cardiac monitoring product revenue as we increase our sales in both the domestic and international markets 
we believe the decrease in sales of our cardiac monitoring products in compared to is a temporary fluctuation and  although we may experience continued decline in cardiac monitoring sales in the near future  we do not expect significant sustained reductions in sales of cardiac monitoring products in the foreseeable future 
we expect significant growth  over time  in sales of our defibrillation products as we continue to participate in the growing overall aed market 
sales of both cardiac monitoring and defibrillation products in any given period may fluctuate  however  due to timing of orders and other factors 
we expect modest growth in service revenue over the longer term 
a number of factors will affect our gross margin in the foreseeable future and our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period and over time  as a result 
factors that may cause changes in our gross margins from period to period include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in sales mix  competitive impact on aed pricing  the effect of product cost reductions and other factors 
we expect continued growth in gross profit from our product and service lines as our revenues increase in upcoming quarters 
as revenues increase  we expect our operating expenses to increase also  though at a slower rate than our overall revenue rate 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of new versions of our products to meet the changing requirements of our customers 
as a result  our research and development expenses are expected to increase in the future 
in addition  we intend to expand our sales and marketing activities both domestically and internationally  in order to increase sales of our products and services 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our sales efforts in both domestic and international locations  hire additional marketing personnel and initiate additional marketing programs 
finally  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future  as we continue to develop our corporate infrastructure in support of the growth of our business 
we expect to continue to incur significant legal expenses related to our patent litigation 
all of our significant litigation cases are currently scheduled for trial arbitration in one instance in the second quarter of based on delays  appeals or other circumstances  however  these proceedings  and related costs  may continue beyond the second half of in addition to these operating expenses  we expect stock based compensation expense to continue to be a significant ongoing expense 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our cardiology products and related consumables  and to a lesser extent  from services 
we categorize our revenues as cardiac monitoring products  which includes capital equipment  software products and related accessories and supplies  defibrillation products  which includes our aeds  hospital defibrillators and related accessories  and service  which includes service contracts  cpr aed training services  aed program management services  equipment maintenance and repair  replacement part sales and other services 
we derive a portion of our service revenue from sales of separate extended maintenance arrangements 
we defer and recognize these revenues over the applicable maintenance period 

table of contents revenues for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended year ended year ended december  change december  change december  dollars in thousands to to cardiac monitoring products of revenue defibrillation products of revenue service of revenue total revenues year ended december  compared to year ended december  cardiac monitoring products revenue decreased by for from the comparable period in this decrease was caused primarily by increased competition and delays in some of our product launches 
we believe that the recent restructuring of our domestic sales organization to provide a wide range of products to our distribution partners  in combination with planned new product introductions  will reverse the trend of decreasing sales in the longer term 
however  further decreases may occur before these factors have the expected effect 
sales of cardiac monitoring products were strong in areas outside of the united states 
defibrillation products revenue increased for from the comparable period in due mostly to the addition of defibrillation products revenue through the merger with csi as of september  defibrillation product revenue increased by approximately over pro forma revenue for the same period last year giving effect to the merger transaction as if the two companies had been combined for the entire period  driven by higher sales both internationally and domestically 
we believe that the worldwide market for aeds is growing and expect continued growth in sales of defibrillator products in the foreseeable future 
service revenue increased for compared to primarily due to the impact of the addition of defibrillation related service revenue 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  cardiac monitoring products revenue decreased slightly for compared to due to softness in us sales of our cardiac stress testing and rehabilitation monitoring products  which were only partially offset by strong sales of electrocardiographs and cardiology management systems and increased international sales of cardiac monitoring products 
the net declines in us sales were primarily related to significant turnover that occurred in the acute care sales force during the year and increased competitive pressure 
defibrillation products revenue began in due to the addition of defibrillation products revenue as a result of the merger with csi as of september  service revenue increased for compared to primarily due to services related to aed deployments  offset partially by a small decline in services related to cardiac monitoring products 
the decline in cardiac monitoring products was due primarily to reduced parts and billable labor sales as customers replaced legacy cardiac monitoring products with newer versions of our products 
gross profit gross profit is the proportion of money left over from revenues after subtracting the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the costs associated with manufacturing  assembling and testing our products  overhead costs  stock based compensation expense  compensation and other costs related to manufacturing support and logistics 
we rely on third parties to manufacture certain of our product components 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to these manufacturers 
cost of service revenue consists of customer support costs  training and professional service expenses  parts and compensation 
our hardware products include a warranty period that includes factory repair services or replacement parts 
we accrue estimated expenses for warranty obligations at the time products are shipped

sales of higher margin cardiac monitoring products in plus product mix changes and productivity improvements in our cardiac monitoring line contributed to the increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue from products as compared to gross profit from service increased slightly for compared to principally due to the addition of gross profit from defibrillation service revenue  partially offset by the lower gross margins on cardiac monitoring service contracts in resulting from increased costs

additional charges of million were incurred during reflecting a write off of licenses relating to discontinued product as well as a write off of demonstration equipment 
these charges to cost of revenues represented an adverse impact to gross profit of approximately 
there were no similar charges during gross profit from products increased for compared to primarily due to the impact of higher gross margin defibrillation products since september  and  to a lesser extent  the result of ongoing cost reduction initiatives  combined with changes in product mix 
gross profit for included charges to cost of products of million discussed above 
these charges to cost of products revenues represented an adverse impact to gross margin from products revenues of approximately 
there were no similar charges during gross profit from service decreased for compared to the decrease in service gross profit was principally attributable to a decrease in cardiac monitoring service revenues  referred to above  without a corresponding decrease in service staffing levels  which have been maintained to provide enhanced support to our customers
