item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to assist readers in understanding the company s financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends which may impact the future performance of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed beginning on page company products and operations the company is a leading global provider of premium products and services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
the company provides a comprehensive line of technologically advanced products and engineering services  including drilling and completion fluid systems  solids control and separation equipment  waste management services  oilfield production chemicals  three cone and diamond drill bits  turbine products  tubulars  fishing services  drilling tools  underreamers  casing exit and multilateral systems  packers and liner hangers 
the company also offers supply chain management solutions through an extensive north american branch network providing pipe  valves and fittings as well as mill  safety and other maintenance products 
the company s operations are largely driven by the level of exploration and production e p spending in major energy producing regions around the world and the depth and complexity of these projects 
although e p spending is significantly influenced by the market price of oil and natural gas  it may also be affected by supply and demand fundamentals  finding and development costs  decline and depletion rates  political actions and uncertainties  environmental concerns  the financial condition of independent e p companies and the overall level of global economic growth and activity 
in addition  approximately eight percent of the company s consolidated revenues relate to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely impacted by the general condition of the us economy 
capital investment by energy companies is largely divided into two markets  which vary greatly in terms of primary business drivers and associated volatility levels 
north american drilling activity is primarily influenced by natural gas fundamentals  with approximately percent of the current rig count focused on natural gas finding and development activities 
conversely  drilling in areas outside of north america is more dependent on crude oil fundamentals  which influence over three quarters of international drilling activity 
historically  business in markets outside of north america has proved to be less volatile as the high cost e p programs in these regions are generally undertaken by major oil companies  consortiums and national oil companies as part of a longer term strategic development plan 
although close to percent of the company s consolidated revenues were generated in north america during  smith s profitability was largely dependent upon business levels in markets outside of north america 
the distribution segment  which accounts for approximately percent of consolidated revenues and primarily supports a north american customer base  serves to distort the geographic revenue mix of the company 
excluding the impact of the distribution segment  percent of the company s revenues were generated in markets outside of north america 
business outlook the company s business is highly dependent on the general economic environment in the united states and other major world economies  which impact energy consumption and the resulting demand for our products and services 
in  the average worldwide rig count grew percent over the prior year period influenced  in part  by higher commodity prices which resulted in increased investment in oil focused drilling projects in markets outside of north america 
the company anticipates modest growth in exploration and production spending in which is expected to be concentrated in the eastern hemisphere regions and  to a lesser extent  in the us offshore market 
although the long term outlook for north american land based drilling activity is favorable based upon expected growth in worldwide energy consumption  an adverse change in near term market fundamentals could cause activity reductions for marginal land based projects 
there are a number of factors which influence forecasted exploration and production spending 
ultimately  any significant deterioration in the global economic environment or prolonged weakness in commodity prices could affect worldwide drilling activity and demand for our products and services 

table of contents results of operations segment discussion the company markets its products and services throughout the world through four business units which are aggregated into two reportable segments 
the oilfield segment consists of three business units m i swaco  smith technologies and smith services 
the distribution segment includes the wilson business unit 
the revenue discussion below has been summarized by business unit in order to provide additional information in analyzing the company s operations

additionally  these operations provide oilfield production chemicals and manufacture and market equipment and services used for solids control  particle separation  pressure control  rig instrumentation and waste management 
m i swaco is significantly influenced by exploration and production spending in markets outside of north america  which contributes approximately two thirds of the unit s revenues  and by its exposure to the us offshore market  which constitutes nine percent of the revenue base 
us offshore drilling accounts for approximately three percent of the worldwide rig count and generally is more revenue intensive than land based projects due to the complex nature of the related drilling environment 
for the year ended december   m i swaco reported revenues of billion  an increase of percent over the prior year period 
excluding the impact of acquired operations  revenues grew percent over the prior year 
approximately two thirds of the base revenue increase was generated in markets outside of north america  primarily reflecting new contract awards and increased customer activity in the europe africa and middle east offshore markets 
north american base revenues grew percent above the prior year level  largely attributable to increased investment by exploration and production companies in land based drilling projects and the impact of price increases implemented in late m i swaco s revenues totaled billion for the year ended december   an increase of percent over the prior year period 
over percent of the business growth was generated in the eastern hemisphere influenced by an percent increase in corresponding activity levels and the impact of new contract awards 
increased exploration and production spending in the north american market  driven by the significant increase in the number of land based drilling programs and  to a lesser extent  the impact of price increases initiated throughout also contributed to the year over year revenue improvement 
smith technologies designs and manufactures three cone drill bits  diamond drill bits and turbines for use in the oil and gas industry 
due to the nature of its product offerings  revenues for these operations typically correlate more closely to the rig count than any of the company s other businesses 
for the year ended december   smith technologies reported revenues of million  an increase of percent over the prior year period 
the majority of the revenue increase was reported by the western hemisphere operations  influenced by higher us land based drilling activity  improved pricing and  to a lesser extent  strong demand for turbine products in the latin america market

the year over year increase reflects growth in the middle east  former soviet union fsu and the north sea area  attributable to new contract awards and improved market penetration 
smith technologies reported revenues of million for the year ended december   an percent increase over the prior year level 
the year over year revenue growth resulted from increased unit sales and rentals of diamond drill bits  as technological advancements in fixed cutter drill bit manufacturing and design has influenced a shift from roller cone toward diamond drill bit product offerings 
to a lesser extent  the impact of higher unit pricing and continued demand for turbine products contributed to the year over year revenue improvement 
smith services manufactures and markets products and services used in the oil and gas industry for drilling  work over  well completion and well re entry 
revenues for smith services are relatively balanced between north america and the international markets and are heavily influenced by the complexity of drilling projects  which drive demand for a wider range of its product offerings 
for the year ended december   smith services reported revenues of billion  percent above the prior year period

two thirds of the core business growth was reported in north america  reflecting increased customer demand for premium remedial product and service lines 
the revenue growth in markets outside of north america was  again  driven by increased demand for remedial product offerings  primarily in the middle east  north sea and fsu regions 
smith services reported revenues of million for the year ended december   a percent increase over the amount reported in excluding the effect of acquired operations  revenues increased percent influenced by higher worldwide exploration and production spending levels 
the majority of the base revenue growth was generated in north america  as increased activity levels impacted tubular product sales  which were twice the level reported in the prior year 
approximately one third of the year over year base revenue growth was reported in markets outside of north america  driven by strong demand for remedial product and service lines in the middle east and north sea markets 

table of contents operating income operating income for the oilfield segment was billion  or percent of revenues  for the fiscal year period 
the segment operating margins were percentage points above the prior year level with incremental operating income approximating percent of revenues 
the operating margin growth was predominantly driven by increased business volumes  but was also favorably impacted by an improved business mix and pricing initiatives 
to a lesser extent  the margin improvement was influenced by improved general and administrative cost coverage

fiscal operating income increased million over the period  net of the litigation related charges 
the growth in operating income was attributable to the impact of higher business volumes on gross profit  partially offset by higher variable based operating expenses associated with the expanding business base 
distribution segment revenues wilson markets pipe  valves  fittings and mill  safety and other maintenance products to energy and industrial markets  primarily through an extensive network of supply branches in the united states and canada 
the segment has the most significant north american revenue exposure of any of the company s operations with approximately percent of wilson s revenues generated in those markets 
moreover  approximately percent of wilson s revenues relate to sales to the downstream energy sector  including petrochemical plants and refineries  whose spending is largely influenced by the general state of the us economic environment 
additionally  certain customers in this sector utilize petroleum products as a base material and  accordingly  are adversely impacted by increases in crude oil and natural gas prices 
for the year ended december   wilson reported revenues of billion  percent above the prior year 
two thirds of the revenue growth was generated by the upstream energy operations  reflecting higher spending by exploration and production companies associated with increased north american drilling and completion activity and the impact of new contract awards

the modest increase in planned investment year over year is associated with growth in spending for the rental equipment fleet to support market expansion efforts in the united states and certain key international regions 
the majority of the capital spending consists of investment for routine additions of rental tool and manufacturing equipment to support the company s operations and maintenance of the company s capital equipment base 
cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million in due to the higher business volumes  which impacted the required investment in working capital  cash flows from operations were not sufficient to fund investing activities  repurchases under the company s stock buyback program and dividend payments

table of contents litigation rose dove egle v 
john m 
egle  et al 
in april  the company acquired all of the equity interests in tri tech fishing services  llc tri tech in exchange for cash consideration of approximately million the transaction 
in august  the company was added as a defendant in a first amended petition filed in the th judicial district court  parish of lafayette  louisiana entitled rose dove egle v 
john m 
egle  et al 
in the amended petition  the plaintiffs alleged that  due to an improper conveyance of ownership interest by the tri tech majority partner prior to the transaction  smith purchased a portion of its equity interest from individuals who were not legally entitled to their tri tech shares 
the suit was tried in the first quarter of  and a jury verdict of approximately million was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs 
the company has appealed the verdict and does not anticipate a ruling until the third quarter of based upon the facts and circumstances and the opinion of outside legal counsel  management believes that an unfavorable outcome on this matter is not probable at this time 
accordingly  the company has not recognized a loss provision in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other the company is a defendant in various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

as of december   the company s environmental reserve totaled million 
this amount reflects the future undiscounted estimated exposure related to identified properties  without regard to indemnifications from former owners 
while actual future environmental costs may differ from estimated liabilities recorded at december   the company does not believe that these differences will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company extends credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
management regularly reviews outstanding receivables and provides for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  management makes judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventory reserves 
the company has made significant investments in inventory to service its customers around the world 
on a routine basis  the company uses judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management s estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations  market fundamentals and the physical condition of products 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
goodwill 
the company has acquired a number of operations during the past decade  which has resulted in the recording of a material amount of goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform an annual goodwill impairment evaluation  which is largely influenced by future cash flow projections 
estimating future cash flows of the company s operations requires management to make judgments about future operating results and working capital requirements 
although the majority of the goodwill relates to the company s oilfield operations  million of goodwill relates to distribution transactions 
changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations would influence the evaluation and may result in the determination that a portion of the goodwill is impaired when the annual analysis is performed 
self insurance 
the company maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of its business and operations 
the company retains a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
in certain cases  management has established reserves to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
environmental obligations 
the company records liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
management s estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  the company generally obtains indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires a two step approach to evaluate tax positions and determine if they should be recognized in the financial statements 
this approach involves recognizing any tax positions that are more likely than not to occur and then measuring those positions to determine if they are recognizable in the financial statements 
the provisions of fin are effective and the company will adopt the interpretation in the first quarter of based on our evaluation as of december   we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
effective december   sfas requires recognition of the funded status of an entity s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
subsequent changes to the funded status are to be recognized through stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income 
in addition  for fiscal years ending after december   sfas requires the adoption of certain provisions related to the measurement date of obligations and assets used to calculate the funded status 
the december  adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we do not expect the remaining elements of the statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the impact of other recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of hedging instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is managed through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and by entering into interest rate contracts  from time to time  on a portion of its long term borrowings 
the company had no interest rate contracts outstanding as of december  and at december   percent of the company s long term debt carried a variable interest rate 
management believes that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is managed primarily through the use of forward exchange contracts 
these contracts increase or decrease in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of the underlying transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all currency contracts are components of the company s hedging program and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
the terms of these contracts generally do not exceed two years 
as of december   the notional amounts of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value was less than the notional amount of these contracts by million 
as of december   the notional amount of fair value hedge contracts and cash flow hedge contracts outstanding were million and million  respectively  and the fair value was less than the notional amount of these contracts by million 
in some areas  where hedging is not cost effective  the company addresses foreign currency exposure utilizing working capital management 
the company utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the company s var computations are based on the historical price movements in various currencies a historical simulation during the year 
the model includes all of the company s foreign exchange derivative contracts 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of currency sensitive instruments  calculated using the var model  was not material to the company s financial position or results of operations
