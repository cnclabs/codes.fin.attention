we derive substantially all of our revenues from monthly subscription fees 
our business has grown rapidly since inception  resulting in substantially increased revenues 
our growth has been fueled by the rapid adoption of dvds as a medium for home entertainment as well as increased awareness of online dvd rentals 
we expect that our business will continue to grow as the market for online dvd rentals continues to grow  a reflection of both the convenience and value of the subscription rental model 
we continued to see strong growth in  with revenues achieving growth from a year ago 
this growth can be attributed to an expanding subscriber base 
we added approximately million net new subscribers in  growing from million at december  to million subscribers at december  recent developments and initiatives we continue to face direct competition from blockbuster 
it remains possible that other potential entrants will offer competing services  either directly or in conjunction with others or that blockbuster will gain more traction in its current business 
we continue to focus on retaining our leadership position and growing our business 
our core strategy is to grow a large dvd subscription business and to expand into internet based movie delivery as that market develops 
we believe that the dvd format  along with its successor formats of hd dvd 
table of contents and blu ray  will continue to be the main vehicle for watching movies in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large dvd subscription business  we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to internet based movie delivery as it becomes a mainstream method for movie distribution 
to this end  we introduced a new feature in january that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their personal computers 
we expect to roll out this instant viewing feature to all subscribers within six months from the date of launch  and we will continue to improve its quality  content and functionality 
we intend to broaden the distribution capability of this service to multiple platforms over time 
key business metrics management periodically reviews certain key business metrics  within the context of our articulated performance goals  in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
the key business metrics include the following churn churn is a monthly measure defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber additions  then divided by three months 
management reviews this metric to evaluate whether we are retaining our existing subscribers in accordance with our business plans 
subscriber acquisition cost subscriber acquisition cost is defined as total marketing expense divided by total gross subscriber additions 
management reviews this metric to evaluate how effective our marketing programs are in acquiring new subscribers on an economical basis in the context of estimated subscriber lifetime value 
gross margin management reviews gross margin to monitor variable costs and operating efficiency 
management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the securities and exchange commission has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
amortization of dvd library and upfront costs we acquire dvds from studios and distributors through either direct purchases or revenue sharing agreements 
we acquire dvds for the purpose of renting them to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues and as such  we consider our dvd library to be a productive asset  and classify our dvd library as a non current asset 
additionally  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards statement of cash flows sfas  we classify cash outflows for the acquisition of the dvd library  net of changes in related accounts payable  as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
this is inclusive of any upfront non refundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements 
we amortize our dvd library  less estimated salvage value  on a sum of the months accelerated basis over its estimated useful life 
the useful life of the new release dvds and back catalog dvds is estimated to be year and years  respectively 
in estimating the useful life of our dvd library  we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds 
volume purchase discounts received from studios on the purchase of titles are recorded as a reduction of dvd library inventory when earned 

table of contents prior to july   we amortized the cost of our entire dvd library  including the capitalized portion of the initial fixed license fee  on a sum of the months accelerated basis over one year 
however  based on a periodic evaluation of both new release and back catalog utilization for amortization purposes  we determined that back catalog titles have a significantly longer life than previously estimated 
as a result  we revised the estimate of useful life for the back catalog dvd library from a sum of the months accelerated method using a one year life to the same accelerated method of amortization using a three year life 
the purpose of this change was to more accurately reflect the productive life of these assets 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes apb  the change in life has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis from july  new releases will continue to be amortized over a one year period 
as a result of the change in the estimated life of the back catalog library  total cost of revenues was million lower  net income was million higher and net income per diluted share was higher for the year ended december  in the third quarter of  we determined that we were selling fewer previously rented dvds than estimated but at an average selling price higher than historically estimated 
we therefore revised our estimate of salvage values on direct purchase dvds 
for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives  a salvage value of per dvd has been provided effective july  for those dvds that we do not expect to sell  no salvage value is provided 
simultaneously with the change in accounting estimate of expected salvage values  we recorded a write off of approximately million related to non recoverable salvage value in the third quarter of revenue sharing agreements enable us to obtain dvds at a lower upfront cost than under traditional direct purchase arrangements 
under revenue sharing agreements  we share a percentage of the actual net revenues generated by the use of each particular title with the studios over a fixed period of time  or the title term  which is typically between and months for each dvd title 
at the end of the title term  we generally have the option of returning the dvd title to the studio  destroying the title or purchasing the title 
in addition  we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios and distributors under revenue sharing agreements 
this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized and amortized in accordance with our dvd library amortization policy 
in some cases  this payment also includes a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is charged to expense as future revenue sharing obligations are incurred 
we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvd library 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas r on january  under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
in the second quarter of  and restated prior periods at that time 
because the fair value recognition provisions of sfas and sfas r were materially consistent under our equity plans  the adoption of sfas r did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
in light of the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  we re evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the value of stock options beginning in the second quarter of expected volatility our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our 
table of contents common stock 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock 
expected life we bifurcate our option grants into two employee groupings executive and non executive based on exercise behavior and consider several factors in determining the estimate of expected life for each group  including the historical option exercise behavior and the terms and vesting periods of the options granted 
from the second quarter of through the fourth quarter of  we used an estimate of expected life of years for one group and years for the other group 
we used an estimate of expected life of years for one group and years for the other group from the second quarter of through the first quarter of we grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis 
such stock options are designated as non qualified stock options and vest immediately 
as a result of immediate vesting  stock based compensation expense determined under sfas r is fully recognized upon the stock option grants and no estimate is required for pre vesting option forfeitures 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
at december   our deferred tax assets  primarily the tax benefits of loss carryforwards  were offset in full by a valuation allowance because of our history of losses through the first quarter of  limited profitable quarters to date and the competitive landscape of online dvd rentals 
as a result of our analysis of expected future income at december   it was considered more likely than not that a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was no longer required resulting in the release of a previously recorded allowance generating a million tax benefit 
as of december   deferred tax assets do not include the tax benefits attributable to approximately million of excess tax deductions related to stock options 
these benefits will only be recorded when realized on tax returns and will be credited to equity at that time 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination
