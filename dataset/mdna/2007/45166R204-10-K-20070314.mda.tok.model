item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations related to future events and future financial performance that involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this document 
overview idenix pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of human viral and other infectious diseases with operations in the united states and europe 
our current focus is on diseases caused by hbv  hcv and hiv 
in october  the company received approval from the fda to market its first product  tyzeka telbivudine  for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis b in the united states 
in territories outside the united states  telbivudine will be marketed as sebivo 
each of tyzeka sebivo and the product candidates that we are developing are selective and specific  are being developed for once a day oral administration  and we believe may be used in combination with other therapeutic agents to improve clinical benefits 
the following table summarizes key information regarding tyzeka sebivo and our pipeline of product candidates and discovery programs current stage indication product product candidates programs of development hbv tyzeka sebivo received marketing approval in more than countries to date  including the united states  switzerland  china  south korea and canada filed applications seeking marketing authorization in the european union  or eu  and certain other territories ongoing phase iii and phase iiib iv clinical studies hbv valtorcitabine phase iib hcv valopicitabine phase iib discovery program preclinical hiv idx completed microdosing study phase in october  we completed a public offering of our common stock in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock  including  shares of common stock to novartis 
from this sale of stock  we received approximately million in net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in july  we completed an initial public offering and concurrent private placement in which we issued and sold  shares of common stock in the public offering and  shares of common stock to novartis in the private placement 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from these offerings  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the collaboration includes the development  license and commercialization agreement dated as of may   by and among us and novartis as amended  and the master manufacturing and supply agreement dated as of may   between us and novartis 
novartis paid us a license fee of million for our hbv product and product candidate  tyzeka sebivo and valtorcitabine  respectively  is providing development funding for tyzeka sebivo and valtorcitabine and will make milestone payments  which 
table of contents could total up to million upon the achievement of specific regulatory approvals 
we achieved one of these regulatory milestones in february with the regulatory approval of sebivo in china for which we expect to receive million from novartis 
additional commercialization milestone payments will be paid to us by novartis upon achievement of predetermined hbv product sales levels 
novartis also acquired an option to license our hcv and other product candidates 
in march  novartis exercised its option to license valopicitabine  our lead hcv product candidate 
as a result  we received a million license payment from novartis in march and novartis is providing development funding for valopicitabine 
novartis has agreed to pay us up to million in additional license fees and regulatory milestone payments for valopicitabine as follows million in license fees upon the advancement of valopicitabine into phase iii clinical trials in treatment na ve and treatment refractory patients in the united states and million in milestone payments upon achievement of regulatory filings and marketing authorization approvals of valopicitabine in the united states  europe and japan 
in addition  novartis has agreed to pay us additional commercialization milestone payments based upon achievement of predetermined sales levels for valopicitabine 
we plan to co promote or co market with novartis in the united states  united kingdom  france  germany  italy and spain all products novartis licenses from us that are successfully developed and approved for commercial sales  including tyzeka sebivo 
novartis has the exclusive right to promote and market such products in the rest of the world 
in support of such co promotion and co marketing activities  we have recruited and employed a sales force in the united states and anticipate recruiting a sales force in each of the other co promotion and co marketing countries in advance of the marketing authorization approval  if any  of sebivo in each of these european countries 
pursuant to the supply agreement  novartis was appointed to finish and package licensed products for commercial sale 
novartis was also afforded the opportunity to manufacture api for the commercial supply of licensed products if certain conditions and criteria were satisfied 
in june  we entered into a commercial manufacturing agreement with novartis and a packaging agreement with novartis pharmaceuticals corporation  an affiliate of novartis 
under the manufacturing agreement  novartis will manufacture the commercial supply of tyzeka that is intended for sale in the united states 
the packaging agreement provides that the supply of tyzeka intended for commercial sale in the united states will be packaged by novartis pharmaceuticals corporation 
we are in discussions with novartis about finalizing the manufacturing rights for the long term supply of sebivo in the rest of the world 
in addition to the collaboration described above  novartis purchased approximately of our outstanding capital stock in may from our then existing stockholders for million in cash  with an additional aggregate amount of up to million contingently payable to these stockholders if we achieve predetermined development milestones relating to an hcv product candidate 
novartis presently owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in addition to tyzeka sebivo  we have three product candidates that are currently in preclinical development or clinical development 
to commercialize any of our product candidates  we will be required to obtain marketing authorization approvals after successfully completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of such product candidates 
currently  tyzeka sebivo has received regulatory approval in more than countries including the united states  switzerland  china  south korea and canada 
additionally  novartis has submitted applications seeking authorization to market sebivo in other territories  including the european union and taiwan 
even with the approval of tyzeka sebivo in the united states and several other markets  we do not expect to realize sufficient product sales in to support our operating costs 
accordingly  we expect our sources of funding for to consist principally of the reimbursement of expenses we may incur in connection with the development of tyzeka sebivo  valtorcitabine and valopicitabine  milestone payments we expect to receive from the approval of sebivo in the european union and china  and anticipated proceeds from product sales of tyzeka sebivo 
since our inception through december   we have recognized revenues from tyzeka product sales in the united states  license fees and milestone payments  development expense reimbursements received from our collaborators and government grants 
we derived substantially all of our total revenues from novartis for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate recognizing additional revenues from our collaboration with novartis 
these revenues include additional development expense funding for tyzeka sebivo  
table of contents valtorcitabine and valopicitabine and other product candidates that novartis may elect to subsequently license from us  as well as  regulatory milestones and  if products are approved for sale  commercialization milestones and revenues derived from sales by us or novartis of our licensed product candidates 
in october  we received approval from the fda to market our first product  tyzeka for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis b in the united states 
shortly thereafter  we started recognizing revenue from product sales associated with tyzeka in the united states 
we have also received marketing authorization approvals for sebivo in a number of countries  including switzerland  south korea  and canada 
we expect that our revenues associated with product sales from tyzeka sebivo will increase in as we and novartis increase our sales efforts to launch this new product 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception in may and expect losses to continue in the foreseeable future 
historically  we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development expenses  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future discovery  development and commercialization activities  principally focused on the commercial launch of tyzeka sebivo  and the expansion of our sales  operational and administrative infrastructure  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and payroll related expenses for research and development personnel  including stock based compensation  fees paid to clinical research organizations and other professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with preclinical studies  costs of material used in research and development  costs of contract manufacturing consultants  occupancy costs associated with the use of our research facilities and equipment  consulting and license fees paid to third parties  and depreciation of property and equipment related to research and development 
we incur the majority of our research and development spending as a result of clinical  preclinical and manufacturing activity with third party contractors relating to the development of our hbv  hcv and hiv product candidates 
we expense internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to engage in research activities  further develop our potential product candidates and advance our clinical trials 
set forth below are the direct third party research and development expenses incurred during the period from may  through december   the years ended december   and in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials of tyzeka sebivo  valtorcitabine and valopicitabine 
period from may inception through december disease product product years ended december  indication candidate total in thousands hbv tyzeka sebivo     hbv valtorcitabine     hcv valopicitabine     
table of contents we anticipate that we will incur significant additional direct third party research and development expenses prior to the commercial launch of our hbv and hcv product candidates 
we expect such amounts to approximate those set forth below estimated additional amount of direct third party research and development expenses expected to be incurred current stage of prior to product candidate development commercial launch valtorcitabine phase iib to million valopicitabine phase iib to million our current estimates of additional direct third party research and development expenses do not include the cost of phase iiib iv clinical trials and other clinical trials that are not required for regulatory approval 
we use our employees and our infrastructure resources across several projects  including our product discovery efforts 
we do not allocate our infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the internal costs incurred to date for our product candidates on a project by project basis 
pursuant to our development agreement with novartis  after it licenses a product candidate  novartis is obligated to fund development expenses that we incur in accordance with development plans agreed upon by us and novartis 
the option we have granted to novartis with respect to its exclusive right to license our product candidates generally requires that novartis exercise the option for each such product candidate prior to the commencement of phase iii clinical trials 
the expenses associated with phase iii clinical trials generally are the most costly component in the development of a successful new product 
our current estimates for additional research and development expenses are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with research  development  clinical trials and the fda and foreign regulatory review and approval processes 
the time and cost to complete development of our product candidates may vary significantly and depends upon a number of factors  including the requirements mandated by the fda and other regulatory agencies  the success of our clinical trials  the availability of financial resources  our collaboration with novartis and its participation in the manufacturing and clinical development of our product candidates 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  were primarily comprised of million in related party revenue from novartis  consisting of million in license fee revenue and million in reimbursement of research and development expenses  and million in product sales in after the approval of tyzeka in the united states in october total revenues for the year ended december  were primarily comprised of million in related party revenue from novartis  consisting of million in license fee revenue and million in reimbursement of research and development expenses 
the increase in revenues of million for the year ended december  as compared with was primarily due to an increase in license fee revenue from novartis as a result of the licensing by novartis of valopicitabine in march 
table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to increases of million for hcv and hiv collaborations with third parties  million in salary and other payroll related expenses associated with the hiring of additional employees for expanded research and development activities  and million in stock based compensation with the adoption of the statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
r 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in expenses for third party contractors  primarily related to lower clinical trial activity as a result of nearing completion of our globe study and certain phase iiib clinical trials for telbivudine 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities  engage in a greater number of later stage clinical trials as we continue to advance our product candidates and explore collaborations with other entities 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to an increase of million in stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas r  and increases in selling and marketing expenses in preparation of and for the commercial launch of tyzeka sebivo

the decrease in revenues of million for the year ended december  as compared with was primarily due to a one time million milestone payment received in june from novartis relating to the development of valopicitabine and lower reimbursements from novartis as a result of the decrease in of the development costs for tyzeka sebivo and valopicitabine 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  the increase of million was principally due to an increase of million in expenses for third party contractors  primarily for clinical trials of valopicitabine and the purchase of comparator drug product used in the clinical trials of valopicitabine and an increase of million increase in salary and other payroll related expenses

the decrease in cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  was due primarily to the receipt of a million license payment from novartis in march offset by an increase in operating expenses 
the increase in the net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses  principally for research and development and marketing activities 
these increases were offset by a net loss for the period excluding stock based compensation expense  an increase in accounts receivable from novartis for the reimbursement of certain research and development costs and deposit payments made to vendors on contracts associated with our phase iii telbivudine clinical trials

table of contents we have certain potential milestone payment obligations relating to our hbv and hcv product and product candidates 
these obligations are excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
in april  we entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory space in montpellier  france 
the term of the lease is for years expiring in april but is cancellable by either party after six years 
the lease agreement also includes an option allowing us the ability to purchase the building at any time after april  the purchase option extends until the expiration of the lease term 
in june  we entered into a lease agreement for additional office space in cambridge  massachusetts 
we entered into amendments to this lease agreement in july and september to lease additional office space in the same building 
the term of the lease for all office space being rented under this lease agreement and its amendments expires in march the lease agreement also includes an option  exercisable not later than nine months prior to the expiration of the initial term  to extend the term of the lease for one additional month period and with rights of first offer with respect to certain expansion space on two of the floors that we occupy 
we also have been provided allowances totaling  to finance a portion of capital improvements to the facility 
these allowances have been recorded as deferred rent  which is being amortized as a reduction of rent over the lease term 
in connection with certain of our operating leases  we have letters of credit with a commercial bank totaling million which expire at varying dates through may pursuant to the license agreement  between us and the university of alabama at birmingham  or the uab license agreement  we were granted an exclusive license to the rights that the university of alabama at birmingham research foundation  or uabrf  emory university and le centre nationale de la recherche scientifique  or cnrs  collectively the licensors  have to a us patent application and progeny thereof and counterpart patent applications in europe  canada  japan and australia that cover the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of hbv infection 
in february  uabrf notified us that it and emory university were asserting a claim that  as a result of the filing of a continuation patent application in july by uabrf  the uab license agreement covers our telbivudine technology 
uabrf contended that we are obligated to pay the licensors an aggregate of million comprised of of the million license fee we received from novartis in may in connection with the license of our hbv product candidates and a million payment in connection with the submission to the fda of the ind pursuant to which we have conducted clinical trials of telbivudine 
we disagree with uabrf s contentions and have advised uabrf and emory university that we will utilize the dispute resolution procedures set forth in the uab license agreement for resolution of this dispute 
under the terms of that agreement  if resolution cannot be achieved through negotiations between the parties or mediation  it must be decided by binding arbitration under the rules of the american arbitration association before a panel of three arbitrators 
we do not regard it to be probable that uabrf s position will be upheld and as such  we have not recorded a liability as of december  however  if it were determined that the uab license agreement does cover our technology  we will become obligated to make payments to the licensors in the amounts and manner specified in the uab license agreement 
while we dispute the demands made by uabrf  even if liability were found to exist  uabrf s claims  in addition to those described above would likely include payments in the aggregate amount of million due upon achievement of regulatory milestones  a royalty on annual sales up to million and a royalty on annual sales greater than million made by us or an affiliate of ours 
additionally  if we sublicense our rights to any entity other than one which holds or controls at least of our capital stock  or if novartis ownership interest in us declines below of our outstanding shares of capital stock  uabrf would likely contend that we would be obligated to pay to the licensors of all royalties received by us from sales by the sublicensee of telbivudine and of all fees  milestone payments and other cash consideration we receive from the sublicensee with respect to telbivudine 
if it were determined that the uab license agreement between us and uabrf does cover our use of telbivudine to treat hbv  or we must otherwise rely upon a license agreement granted by the licensors to commercialize telbivudine  we may be in breach of certain of the representations and warranties we made in the development agreement and the stock purchase agreement 
for a further description see collaborations 
table of contents relationship with novartis indemnification and risk factors factors related to our relationship with novartis and factors related to patents and licenses 
separately  we had a research collaboration with cnrs  one of the licensors 
in may  we and novartis entered into an amended and restated cooperative agreement with cnrs and l universite montpellier  or the university of montpellier  pursuant to which we worked in collaboration with scientists from cnrs and the university of montpellier to discover and develop technologies relating to antiviral substances 
the agreement included provisions relating to the ownership and commercialization of the technology  which is discovered or obtained as part of the collaboration as well as rights regarding ownership or use of such technology upon termination of the agreement 
this cooperative agreement expired in december we do not believe that the matters disputed by uabrf and emory university regarding the uab license agreement will have any effect on either our cooperative agreement with cnrs and the university of montpellier or the technology licenses  including a license to telbivudine  which have been granted to us pursuant to the cooperative agreement 
in january  the board of trustees of the university of alabama and related entities filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama southern division against us  cnrs and the university of montpellier 
the complaint alleges that a former employee of the uab is a co inventor of certain patents related to the use of l deoxy nucleosides for the treatment of hbv assigned to one or more of us  cnrs and the university of montpellier and which cover the use of tyzeka sebivo  our product for the treatment of hbv 
the university of alabama has included a demand for damages under various theories in its complaint  but did not specify the amount of damages that it alleges to have been incurred 
we have not yet been able to determine whether the university of alabama would be entitled to damages or the extent thereof if it were successful on its substantive claims 
we intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit 
additionally  in connection with the resolution of matters relating to certain of our hcv product candidates we entered into a settlement agreement with uabrf which provides for a milestone payment of million to uabrf upon receipt of regulatory approval in the united states to market and sell certain hcv products invented or discovered by our chief executive officer during the period from november  to november  such hcv products would include valopicitabine if successfully developed and commercialized 
further  we have potential payment obligations under the license agreement with the university of cagliari pursuant to which we have the exclusive worldwide right to make  use and sell valopicitabine and certain other hcv and hiv technology 
we are liable for certain payments to the university of cagliari if we receive from novartis or another collaborator license fees or milestone payments with respect to such technology 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals corporation or sumitomo  under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may the settlement agreement which we entered into with sumitomo provides for a million milestone payment to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
in october  we entered into a two year research collaboration agreement with metabasis therapeutics  inc  or metabasis 
under the terms of the agreement  metabasis proprietary liver targeted technology will be applied to certain of our compounds to develop second generation nucleoside analog product candidates for the treatment of hcv 
as part of the agreement  we provided a million upfront payment to metabasis  which was recorded in research and development expense in the fourth quarter of if a lead candidate is identified  we will assume development responsibility and metabasis will be eligible to receive payments upon achievement of predetermined clinical development and regulatory milestones 
for any resultant marketed products  we will retain full commercial rights and pay metabasis a royalty based on net sales of the product 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  funding we expect to receive from novartis relating to the development of tyzeka sebivo  valtorcitabine and valopicitabine  and milestone payments we expect to receive from novartis for the approval of sebivo in the european union and china  together with anticipated proceeds from sales of tyzeka sebivo will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs until the end of at any time  it is possible that we may seek additional financing 
we may seek such financing 
table of contents through a combination of public or private equity or debt financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
additional funding may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  other than novartis which has the right to maintain its current ownership level  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to obtain financing when needed may harm our business and operating results 
off balance sheet transactions we currently have no off balance sheet transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to collaborative research and development  revenue recognition  accrued expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this document  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements collaborative research and development revenue we recognize revenues relating to our collaborative research and development arrangements in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenues under such collaborative research and development arrangements may include non refundable license fees  milestones and research and development payments from collaborative partners 
where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement  we recognize non refundable license fees as revenue over the specified development period during which we complete our performance obligations 
when our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on the part of our management 
if this estimated performance period changes  then we will adjust the periodic revenue we are recognizing and will record the remaining unrecognized non refundable license fees over the remaining period during which our performance obligations will be completed 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
to date  we have received from novartis a million license fee for valopicitabine  a million license fee for tyzeka sebivo and valtorcitabine  and a million reimbursement for reacquiring product rights from sumitomo to develop and commercialize sebivo in certain markets in asia 
we included this reimbursement as part of the license fee for accounting purposes because novartis required the repurchase of these rights as a condition to entering into the development agreement 
we also incurred approximately million in costs associated with the development of valopicitabine prior to novartis licensing valopicitabine in march for which novartis has reimbursed us 
the sum of these amounts received from novartis  totaling million has been recorded as license fees and is being recognized over the development period of the licensed product candidates 
we review our assessment and judgment on a quarterly basis with respect to the expected duration of the development period of our licensed product candidates 
we have estimated that the performance period during which the development of tyzeka sebivo  valtorcitabine and valopicitabine will be completed is a period of 
table of contents approximately seven and one half years following the effective date of the development agreement that we entered into with novartis  or december we are recognizing revenue on the license fee payments over this period 
if the estimated performance period changes  we will adjust the periodic revenue that is being recognized and will record the remaining unrecognized license fee payments over the remaining development period during which our performance obligations will be completed 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
novartis has the right to purchase  at par value of per share  such number of shares as is required to maintain its percentage ownership of our voting stock if we issue shares of capital stock in connection with the acquisition or in licensing of technology through the issuance of up to of our stock in any month period 
the novartis stock purchase rights will remain in effect until the earlier of the date that novartis and its affiliates own less than of our voting stock or the date that novartis becomes obligated to make contingent payments of million to those holders of the our stock who sold shares to novartis on may  additionally  if we issue any shares of our capital stock  other than in certain situations  novartis has the right to purchase such number of shares required to maintain its percentage ownership of our voting stock for the same consideration per share paid by others acquiring our stock 
subject to certain exceptions  upon the grant of options and stock awards under stock incentive plans  other than the equity incentive plan  we record  as a reduction of the license fees and payments received from novartis  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less the exercise price  if any  payable by the option or award holder 
the amount is attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized as of that date and the remaining amount of deferred revenue 
these amounts are adjusted through the date that either novartis elects to exercise its stock subscription rights or the right expires 
these adjustments will also be attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized through the measurement date and the remaining deferred revenue 
in connection with the closing of our initial public offering in july  novartis terminated a common stock subscription right with respect to  shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the equity incentive plan in connection with the exercise of stock options granted after may  in exchange for novartis termination of such right  we issued  shares of our common stock to novartis for a purchase price of per share 
the fair value of these shares was determined to be million at the time of issuance 
as a result of the issuance to novartis of these shares  novartis rights to purchase additional shares as a result of future option grants and stock issuances under the equity incentive plan were terminated and no additional adjustments to revenue and deferred revenue will be required for options exercised under this plan 
prior to the termination of the stock subscription rights under the equity incentive plan  as we granted options that were subject to novartis stock subscription right  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less par value  was recorded as an adjustment of the license fee and payments received from novartis in may we are still subject to potential revenue adjustments relating to future grants of options and stock awards under our stock incentive plan and other equity plans that our board of directors may approve and stockholders adopt 
as of december   the license fee has been reduced by million and has been reclassified to additional paid in capital 
of this amount  million has been recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue as of december  with the remaining amount of million recorded as a reduction of revenue 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo pharmaceuticals corporation or sumitomo  under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may we repurchased these product rights for million 
the repurchase of these rights resulted in a million reversal of revenue that we previously recognized under our original arrangements with sumitomo 
we recorded the remaining amount of million as a reduction of deferred revenue 
we have also included million in deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet at december  representing amounts received from sumitomo that we have not included in our revenue to date 
we are required to pay an additional million to sumitomo upon the first commercial sale of telbivudine in japan 
this payment will be recorded first as a reduction of the remaining million of deferred revenue  with the excess recorded as an expense 
if and when we determine that we will not seek regulatory approval 
table of contents for telbivudine in japan  we would have no further obligations under the settlement agreement with sumitomo and  therefore  the million of remaining deferred revenue would be recognized as revenue at that time 
we recognize payments received from collaborative partners for research and development efforts that we perform or others perform on our behalf as revenue as the related costs are incurred 
we recognize such revenue only if we believe that collection of these amounts is reasonably assured 
this assessment involves judgment on our part 
if we do not believe that collection of amounts billed  or amounts to be billed to our collaborators  is reasonably assured  then we defer revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from milestones related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations upon achievement of the milestone if the milestone is deemed substantive 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
in june  we recognized a million milestone payment from novartis based upon results of a phase i clinical trial relating to valopicitabine 
since the milestone was determined to be substantive  this amount was recognized as revenue when it became payable 
where we have no continuing involvement under a collaborative arrangement  we record non refundable license fee revenue when we have a contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement  and we record milestones when we receive appropriate notification from the collaborative partner of achievement of the milestones 
in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which we refer to as eitf no 
eitf no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into on or after july  accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees  such as amounts due to clinical research organizations  professional service fees  such as attorneys and accountants  and investigators in conjunction with preclinical and clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of materials related to our product candidates and third party expenses relating to marketing efforts associated with commercialization of our product and product candidates 
accruals for amounts due to clinical research organizations are among our most significant estimates 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services incurred by the service providers 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us and account for these estimates in accordance with accounting principles involving accrued expenses and income tax liabilities generally accepted in the united states

accordingly  financial statement amounts for the periods prior to the adoption of sfas no

r 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
and related interpretations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  or fsp fas r in accordance with fsp fas r  entities can choose to follow either the transitional guidance of sfas r or the alternative transition method described in fsp fas r effective in the fourth quarter of  we elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool  or apic pool or windfall  related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of the alternative transition method resulted in no impact on our financial statements 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during the year ended december  using the black scholes method  we have made assumptions for the inputs in the model regarding expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate  expected option term and expected volatility 
the amounts recognized for stock based compensation expense could vary depending upon changes in assumptions in the model 
no dividend yield was assumed as we do not pay dividends on our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of us treasury securities consistent with the expected life of the option for the year ended december  
the expected option term years for the year ended december  and expected volatility for the year ended december  were determined by examining the expected option term and volatility of our own stock as well as the expected terms and volatilities of similarly sized biotechnology companies 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it should be reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods as options vest  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
during the year ended december   because substantially all of the company s stock option grants vest monthly  no forfeiture assumption was applied 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
we recognize compensation expense for restricted stock sold and stock options granted to non employees in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf eitf requires such equity instruments to be recorded at their fair value at the measurement date  which is generally the vesting date of the instruments 
therefore  the measurement of stock based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest 
our equity incentive plans are administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors 
the compensation committee determines the type and term of each award  the award exercise or purchase price  if applicable  the number of shares underlying each award granted and the rate at which each award becomes vested or 
table of contents exercisable 
incentive stock options may be granted only to employees at an exercise price per share not less than the fair market value per share of common stock as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant not less than of the fair market value in the case of holders of more than of our common stock and with a term not to exceed ten years from the date of grant five years for incentive stock options granted to holders of more than of our voting common stock 
nonqualified stock options may be granted to any officer  employee  director  consultant or advisor at a per share exercise price in such amount as the compensation committee may determine 
the compensation committee may also grant restricted stock and other stock based awards on terms and conditions it may determine 
these equity incentive plans are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of our consolidated statements of operations  we have allocated stock based compensation to expense categories based on the nature of the service provided by the recipients of the stock option and restricted stock grants 
we expect to continue to grant options to purchase common stock in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb published fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions or fin no 
this interpretation seeks to reduce the significant diversity in practice associated with recognition and measurement in the accounting for income taxes 
it would apply to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
requires that a tax position meet a more likely than not threshold for the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
this threshold is to be met assuming that the tax authorities will examine the uncertain tax position 
fin no 
contains guidance with respect to the measurement of the benefit that is recognized for an uncertain tax position  when that benefit should be derecognized  and other matters 
fin no 
should clarify the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with sfas fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that this interpretation will have on our financial statements 
in september  fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  was issued 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that this standard will have on our financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sab no 
provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of sasb statements no 
   and r  or sfas no 
this statement improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity or changes in unrestricted net assets of a not for profit organization

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital  while maintaining liquidity  until it is required to fund operations 
to minimize risk  we maintain our operating cash in commercial bank accounts 
we invest our excess cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  us government guaranteed debt obligations  repurchase agreements with major financial institutions and certain corporate debt securities with the dollar weighted average effective maturity of the portfolio less than months and no security with an effective maturity in excess of months 
since our investments are short term in duration and the investments are denominated in us dollars  we believe that we are not subject to any material credit  market or foreign exchange risk exposure 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million to our interest rate sensitive instruments
