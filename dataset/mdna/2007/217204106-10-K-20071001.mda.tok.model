overview we provide vehicle suppliers  primarily insurance companies  with a full range of remarketing services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation  or vb  internet auction style sales technology 
in the united kingdom  or uk  we sell salvage vehicles through a combination of live auctions and internet bidding 
we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers  rebuilders  repair licensees  used vehicle dealers and exporters 
salvage vehicles are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made 
we offer vehicle suppliers a full range of remarketing services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs 
in the united states  or us  we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage 
in the united kingdom  we operate primarily on a principal basis  purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicle for our own account to buyers through a combination of live auctions and internet sales 
our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers  transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues 
consignment revenues from suppliers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling the vehicles regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or  under our percentage incentive program  or pip program  our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price 
under the fixed fee program  we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation 
although sometimes included in the consignment fee  we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility  storage of the vehicle  and other incidental costs 
under the consignment programs  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue  not the actual sales price gross proceeds 
salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles  storage and annual registration 
transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under certain contracts 
transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 
purchased vehicle revenue  includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and primarily generated in the uk 
operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fuel  equipment maintenance and repair  and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts 
because we operate as a principal in the uk  purchasing and reselling salvaged vehicles for our own account  we expect operating costs to increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management  accounting  data processing  sales personnel  human resources  professional fees  research and development and marketing expenses 
during fiscal  we converted all of our north american vehicle remarketing facilities to an internet based auction style model using our vb internet sales technology 
this process employs a two step bidding process 
the first step  called the preliminary bid  allows buyers to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual action begins 
the second step allows buyers to bid against each other  and the high bidder from the preliminary bidding process  in a real time process over the internet 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we adopted a formal plan to discontinue the operations of our public auction business motors auction group  or mag  and dispose of or convert the related assets 
the mag yards converted into salvage facilities will continue to be included in the results of continuing operations on the income statements 
acquisitions and new operations we have experienced significant growth as we have acquired sixteen vehicle storage facilities and established fourteen new facilities since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle suppliers  we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by our facilities 
as part of this strategy  in fiscal we acquired seven new facilities in the uk located in sandy  sandtoft  sandwich  westbury  chester  denny  and wootton and in north america we opened new facilities in baltimore  maryland  woodburn  oregon and punta gorda  florida 
in fiscal we acquired new facilities in or near greenwood  nebraska  grand island  nebraska  york haven  pennsylvania  chambersburg  pennsylvania  altoona  pennsylvania  fruitland  maryland  billings  montana and opened new facilities in or near honolulu  hawaii  lansing  michigan  dover  florida and jacksonville  florida 
in fiscal we acquired new facilities in or near lexington  kentucky and columbia  missouri and opened new facilities in strongsville  ohio  ocala  florida  knoxville  tennessee  loganville  georgia  spokane  washington  tallahassee  florida and hialeah  florida 
we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america and the united kingdom and are able to provide national coverage for our suppliers 
on june   we acquired all the issued share capital of universal salvage plc  or universal  for per share approximately based on currency exchange rates on june  
universal  based in the uk and operating exclusively within the uk  is a service provider to the motor insurance and automotive industries 
the aggregate acquisition consideration paid by us totaled approximately million approximately million based on currency exchange rates on june  and was funded from our available cash resources 
we also assumed outstanding indebtedness of universal totaling approximately million million as of june  
the acquisition marks our first acquisition outside north america and includes the seven facilities discussed above 
the period to period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions  new openings  weather and product introductions during such periods 
in particular  the uk acquisition  because of its size and  also  because the uk operates primarily on the principal model versus the agency model employed in the united states  will have a significant impact on the comparability of revenues and gross margin percentages in future periods 
in addition to growth through acquisitions  we seek to increase revenues and profitability by  among other things  i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle storage facilities in key markets  ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements  iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers  and iv expanding the application of vb into new markets 
in addition  we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures  integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel  when necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below  certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income presented in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the following sets forth information on customer revenue by geographic region based on the location of the selling entity in thousands  except percentages percentage of percentage of revenue revenue north america united kingdom revenues from continuing operations were approximately  million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or over fiscal revenue growth from same store sales in north america  those opened before august   was approximately million 
revenue growth from new facilities  those opened after august   including facilities in or near baltimore  maryland  woodburn  oregon  and punta gorda  florida was approximately million 
of the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  million was attributable to revenues generated in the uk from june   the date of acquisition 
yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million  or  over fiscal included in yard expenses is depreciation expense of million  an increase of million over fiscal yard operation expenses decreased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal the decreases in yard expenses  excluding depreciation  were primarily attributable to the decrease in incremental abnormal costs incurred as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita during fiscal these additional inventory type costs were approximately million during fiscal as compared to million during the fiscal  and were charged to yard operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
these costs include the additional subhauling  payroll  equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes 
these costs do not include normal expenses associated with the increased unit volume created by the hurricanes  which are deferred until the sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance sheet 
as of july   all of the incremental salvage vehicles received as a result of the hurricanes katrina and rita have been sold 
in addition  yard operation expenses include costs attributable to the uk of million 
the uk operates primarily on a principal basis and  accordingly has a lower gross margin percentage 
the following sets forth information on gross margin  defined as revenue less yard operation expenses  and gross margin percentage by geographic region in thousands  except percentages north america united kingdom general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal included in general and administrative expenses is depreciation of million an increase of million over fiscal also included are million in general and administrative costs  other than depreciation attributable to the uk operations 
finally the remaining increase was due to increased payroll costs  professional services  and general corporate expansion 
these increases were offset by decreased operating lease costs on computer equipment leases  which were bought out during the year and a reduction in legal costs 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal of the increase in general and administrative expense  million was attributable to general and administrative expenses incurred in the uk 
general and administrative expenses in the uk include amortization expense relating to the universal acquisition 
the following sets forth information on general and administrative expenses and shown as a percentage of revenue by geographic region in thousands except percentages percentage of percentage of revenue revenue north america united kingdom other income 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million from fiscal the increase is due primarily to a million increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and a higher average cash and investments balance and a decrease of million in losses from an equity investment in lanelogic corporation lanelogic 
other income  which consists primarily of rental income and gain on the sales of assets  increased approximately million 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of fiscal including a non recurring million out of period reduction  to deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense originating primarily in and prior years 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations declined million from fiscal to fiscal as we discontinued our mag operations and disposed of or converted all the related assets during fiscal there were no such disposals in fiscal net income 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased vehicle unit volume driven by the additional salvage vehicles associated with hurricanes katrina and rita  growth in vehicles processed at existing yards and vehicles processed from new yards opened or acquired in fiscal existing facilities contributed approximately million of the revenue growth and new facilities in or near honolulu  hawaii  greenwood  nebraska  grand island  nebraska  york haven  pennsylvania  chambersburg  pennsylvania  altoona  pennsylvania  fruitland  maryland  lansing  michigan and billings  montana contributed approximately million of new revenue growth 
yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal included in yard expenses is depreciation expense of million  an increase of million over fiscal yard operation expenses increased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal the increases in yard expenses were primarily attributable to the cost of handling increased volume  a general increase in subhauling costs and the incremental abnormal costs incurred as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
these additional inventory type costs were approximately million in fiscal and were charged to yard operations in accordance with sfas these costs include the additional subhauling  payroll  equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes 
these costs do not include normal expenses associated with the increased unit volume created by the hurricanes  which are deferred until the sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance sheet 
at the end of fiscal  approximately of the incremental salvage vehicles received as a result of the hurricanes remained unsold and in inventory and were subsequently disposed of in fiscal the processing of the hurricane vehicles has had and may continue to have a negative impact on gross and operating margin percentages 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in telecommunication costs  information technology payroll costs  costs relating to sarbanes oxley compliance  sfas r stock compensation costs and outside legal expense associated with a patent litigation matter that was settled during fiscal and other pending litigation and general corporate expansion 
general and administrative expenses increased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues reflects in part changes in the nature of our business 
in particular  the introduction of vb resulted in a reduction in certain yard operation expenses relating to conducting live auctions but increased our general and administrative expenses as we continued to make technology infrastructure investments and hire additional personnel to enhance and maintain vb and other products for use in our auctions 
other income 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million  from fiscal the decrease was due primarily to a million loss recognized from an equity investment in an unconsolidated privately held entity 
this loss was offset by an increase in interest income of approximately million due to higher interest rates and a higher average cash and investments balance 
other income  which consists primarily of rental income and gain on the sales of non fleet assets  decreased approximately million  resulting from losses on disposals of fixed assets 
income taxes 
our effective combined federal  state and local income tax rates for fiscal and was approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in effective tax rate is primarily the result of recording a non recurring million out of period reduction to deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense originating primarily in and adjustments to our state tax reserves based on the favorable outcome of an audit 
discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we adopted a formal plan to discontinue the operations of our public auction business motors auction group  mag  and dispose of or convert the related assets 
the mag yards to be converted into salvage facilities will continue to be included in the results of continuing operations on the income statements 
under sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present 
the discontinuation of an operating segment is one of those indicators 
accordingly  goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
as of the second quarter of we used a combination of valuation techniques  which included consideration of market based approaches and an income approach  in determining the fair value of our applicable reporting unit in the interim impairment test of goodwill 
in fiscal  the impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the mag goodwill exceeded its implied fair value 
the corresponding write down of goodwill of million to its fair value was reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we also determined that the value of the remaining mag covenants not to compete were impaired and recorded an impairment expense in the amount of million 
this write down of covenants not to compete is also reported as a component of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold the business and related assets of one of the mag locations for approximately million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold the business and related assets including the real estate of one of the mag locations 
we received a million promissory note from the buyer as purchase consideration 
the promissory note bears interest at per annum 
interest only payments on the note are due monthly until maturity on may   at which time the balance of the note is due in full 
the note receivable is collateralized by the real estate and is personally guaranteed by the buyer 
the consideration was allocated to the real estate  based on an appraisal  and to the business in proportion to their estimated fair values 
the portion of the consideration allocated to the real estate sale totaled million 
we deferred a gain on the sale of the real estate of approximately million that will be recognized upon payment of the principal balance of the note receivable 
the remaining consideration of million is allocated to the sale of the business 
we recognized a gain on the sale of the business of approximately million  which is included in the results of the discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold the business and related assets excluding the real estate of another mag location 
we received a million promissory note and million in cash from the buyer as purchase consideration 
we recognized a gain on the sale of the business of approximately million which is included in the results of discontinued operations 
as of july   no mag locations remained 
three of the original six mag locations were sold and three were converted into salvage facilities 
net income 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations  public offerings of common stock  the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing 
cash and cash equivalents  combined with short term investments decreased by approximately million from july  to july   primarily as a result of cash used for the acquisition of universal  purchases of property and equipment and repurchases of common stock which was offset by cash generated from continuing operations 
during the winter months  most of our facilities process to more vehicles than at other times of the year 
this increased seasonal volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 
our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers fees  buyers fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of sold vehicles 
as of july   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
during the course of the year  we invest substantially all of our cash balances in aaa rated auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are principally variable rate securities tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of days 
auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified dutch auction  at predetermined short term intervals  usually every  or days 
they trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer 
interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction 
although these instruments are issued and rated as long term securities  they are priced and traded as short term securities because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset 
we believe that our currently available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we experience significant growth in the future  we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal  due to the increase in net income which was offset in part to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal and the loss on discontinued operations in the amount of million in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal during fiscal we consumed cash through the growth in accounts receivable and vehicle pooling costs and we generated cash through the growth in deferred revenue 
the movements in these accounts are driven primarily by the significant growth in vehicles held for sale which was impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
the decrease in net income is primarily a result of the loss on discontinued operations in the amount of million  which was offset in part by increased revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal  primarily due to the increase in net income  which was offset in part to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
investing activities during the fiscal years ended july   and  we purchased approximately million  million and million  respectively of short term investments  which were offset by the sale of million  million  million  respectively of short term investments 
we typically invest our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of aaa 
capital expenditures related to continuing operations excluding those associated with property and equipment attributable to acquisitions were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures are primarily related to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used approximately million in cash for the acquisition of universal which includes the following seven locations in the uk sandy  sandtoft  sandwich  westbury  chester  denny  and wootton 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used cash for the acquisition of facilities in or near billings  montana  fruitland  maryland  altoona  pennsylvania  chambersburg  pennsylvania  york haven  pennsylvania  greenwood  nebraska and grand island  nebraska  which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used cash for the acquisition of operations in lexington  kentucky and columbia  missouri  which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately million 
during the year ended july   we invested approximately million for a equity interest in lanelogic  a delaware limited liability corporation lanelogic 
we have no further contractual funding commitment 
based on our evaluation of lanelogic and the related agreements  management believes that lanelogic does not constitute a variable interest entity as defined in fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
as a result  our investment has been accounted for under the equity method prescribed by apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our chairman and ceo  made a personal unsecured loan to lanelogic to prevent a restriction of working capital from disrupting its business as lanelogic sought additional equity financing 
the loan was repaid during the second quarter ended january  we have concluded that the personal unsecured loan did not cause a change in the accounting of lanelogic as an equity method investment 
during the second quarter ended january   lanelogic received a strategic equity investment totaling approximately million from two new investment groups as well as lanelogic s founder 
we did not participate in this additional equity financing into lanelogic 
in addition  lanelogic converted from a limited liability company to a delaware corporation  of which we are now a stockholder 
on august   subsequent to the end of our fiscal year  our chairman and ceo provided a personal guaranty in favor of dealer services corporation as a condition for providing a credit facility to lanelogic  inc a corporation in which we have a less than controlling interest 
the guaranty was approved by our audit committee 
we have concluded that the personal guaranty does not cause a change in the accounting of lanelogic as an equity method investment 
financing activities in fiscal  and  we generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  through the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  and  we generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  through the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase program 
in february  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no time limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program 
the repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time 
for the year ended july   we repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of 
for the year ended july   we repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of 
no shares were repurchased in fiscal we accounted for the repurchase of our common stock in the years ended july  and by reducing common stock by million and million  respectively 
during the period from february through july   we repurchased a total of  shares at a weighted average price of 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases capital leases pending acquisition of century salvage total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years letters of credit contractual obligations consist of future non cancelable minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases  used in the normal course of business 
on july   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire century salvage sales limited  a vehicle salvage disposal company with three facilities located in the united kingdom 
the transaction closed on august  commercial commitments include primarily letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions 
credit facilities on february   we entered into a credit facility with our existing banking syndicate 
the facility provided by wells fargo bank  fleet national bank and us bank national association consists of an unsecured revolving reducing line of credit in the amount of approximately million 
on may   the line of credit was reduced to zero and the line of credit was terminated in accordance with its terms 
on november   universal salvage  our wholly owned subsidiary purchased on june   entered into three credit facilities with national westminster bank plc 
the first facility provides approximately million in overdraft protection and working capital 
the second and third facilities of approximately and million  respectively  provide liquidity for acquisitions and investments 
each of these facilities carries an interest rate of the bank s index  which was at july   plus 
and is collateralize by real property 
at july  there were no amounts borrowed under these facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to vehicle pooling costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  income taxes  long lived assets and self insured liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer 
these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery  loading  title processing  preparation and storage 
we evaluate multiple element arrangements relative to our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  which addresses accounting for multiple element arrangements  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting 
the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller s behalf and under most of our current north american contracts  collecting the proceeds from the buyer 
we are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and  accordingly  we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection 
vehicle sales  where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf are recognized in accordance with sab on the sale date  which is typically the point of high bid acceptance 
upon high bid acceptance  a legal binding contract is formed with the buyer  and we record the gross sales price as revenue 
in certain cases  seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds from the buyer 
however  we determined that we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value for undelivered items 
as a result  we do not recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered  which generally occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller 
we provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle  charging a separate fee for each service 
each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of eitf to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multi element arrangement 
we have concluded that the sale and the post sale services are separate units of accounting 
the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale  and the fees for the post sale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual method 
we also charge buyers an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program  which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  and relist and late payment fees  which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the buyer 
no provision for returns has been established  as all sales are final with no right of return  although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of non performance by our buyers and sellers 
vehicle pooling costs we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us  but not sold as of the balance sheet date 
we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period  the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period 
the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs  labor  transportation  and vehicle processing 
if our allocation factors change  then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future 
these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis 
we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  no 
 inventory costs sfas to our vehicle pooling costs 
sfas requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal as provided in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
in addition  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments 
if billing disputes exceed expectations and or if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of goodwill we evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our salvage sales operating segment  annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 
income taxes and deferred tax assets we are required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions 
such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
us generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance when  in certain taxable jurisdictions  the utilization of the tax asset is uncertain 
additional timing differences  future earning trends and or tax strategies may occur which could warrant a need for establishing an additional valuation allowance or a reserve 
long lived asset valuation  including intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future  we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method as required by sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost related to share based payment transactions  measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued  be recognized in the financial statements 
determining the fair value of options using the black scholes model  or other currently accepted option valuation models  requires highly subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise  which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the grant date 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense  which could have a material impact on financial position and results of operations 
retained insurance liabilities we are partially self insured for certain losses related to medical  general liability  workers compensation and auto liability 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation  differ from our estimates  our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be impacted 
recently issued accounting standards for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate and foreign currency risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
as of july   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate and aaa rated auction rate securities  which also bear interest at a variable rate 
due to the average maturity and nature of the company s investment portfolio  we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are variable  a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows  but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments 
our exposure to foreign currency risks relates to our operations in canada and the uk 
we do not hedge our exposure to the canadian dollar or the british pound 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
