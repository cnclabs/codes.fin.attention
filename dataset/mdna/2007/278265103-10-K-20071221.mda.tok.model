cash management fund assets  which are not included in long term fund net flows because of their short term characteristics  decreased to billion on october  from billion on october  and billion on october  the decrease in cash management fund assets in fiscal can be primarily attributed to an increase in short term treasury fund redemptions by institutional clients 
the increase in cash management fund assets in fiscal can be primarily attributed to investments by institutional clients in our sponsored short term income funds and the introduction of a cash collateral fund accompanying a securities lending program in which certain of our sponsored funds participate

results of operations we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and million  or per diluted share  in fiscal operating results for fiscal reflect the payment of million in one time structuring fees and million in marketing incentives related to three closed end funds offered during the fiscal year 
these one time structuring fees and marketing incentives  which are included in distribution expense and compensation expense  respectively  reduced fiscal earnings by per diluted share 
operating results for fiscal also include payments totaling million to merrill  lynch  pierce  fenner smith and ag edwards sons  inc to terminate compensation agreements in respect of certain of our previously offered closed end funds under which we were obligated to make payments over time based on the assets of the respective closed end funds 
these one time termination payments  which are included in distribution expense  reduced diluted earnings for fiscal by approximately per share 
earnings for the fiscal year were also reduced by million  or per diluted share  by costs associated with the management reorganization of eaton vance distributors  inc evd announced in october and a loss of million  or per diluted share  realized on an interest rate lock entered into in connection with the offering of senior notes 
fiscal results include the acceleration of non cash amortization to write off intangible assets of million  or per diluted share  relating to the termination of certain institutional and high net worth asset management contracts at fox asset management  as well as the recognition of million in interest expense and the write off of million of deferred financing fees associated with the retirement of evm s zero coupon exchangeable notes in august the additional interest expense and the write off of the deferred financing fees reduced fiscal earnings by per diluted share

we define adjusted operating income as operating income plus closed end fund structuring fees and one time payments  stock based compensation and any write off of intangible assets or goodwill 
we believe that adjusted operating income is a key indicator of our ongoing profitability and therefore use this measure as the basis for calculating performance based management incentives 
adjusted operating income is not  and should not be construed to be  a substitute for operating income computed in accordance with gaap 
however  in assessing the performance of the business  our management and the board of directors look at adjusted operating income as a measure of underlying performance  since amounts resulting from one time events eg  the offering of a closed end fund do not necessarily represent normal results of operations 
in addition  when assessing performance  management and the board look at performance both with and without stock based compensation

investment advisory and administration fees investment advisory and administration fees are determined by contractual agreements with our sponsored funds and separate accounts and are generally based upon a percentage of the market value of assets under management 
net asset flows and changes in the market value of managed assets affect the amount of managed assets on which investment advisory and administration fees are earned  while shifts in asset mix affect the company s average effective fee rate 
the increase in investment advisory and administration fees of percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively  over the same periods a year earlier can be attributed primarily to an increase in average assets under management  which increased by percent and percent in fiscal and  respectively  and a modest increase in our average effective investment advisory and administration fee rates 
fund average effective fee rates increased to basis points in fiscal from basis points and basis points in fiscal and  respectively 
separately managed account average effective fee rates were basis points in fiscal  and distribution and underwriter fees distribution plan payments  which are made under contractual agreements with our sponsored funds  are calculated as a percentage of average assets under management in specific share classes of our mutual funds  as well as certain private funds

stock based compensation increased by percent  or million  reflecting in part a percent increase in average headcount and the acceleration of the recognition of stock based compensation associated with option grants made to retirement eligible employees 
our retirement policy provides that an employee is eligible for retirement at age  or for early retirement when the employee reaches age and has a combined age plus years of service of at least years or with our consent 
because many of our outstanding stock options allow for nonforfeiture of options upon retirement  the adoption of sfas no 
r on november  resulted in the immediate recognition of compensation expense at grant date for all awards granted to retirement eligible employees on or after the adoption of sfas no 
r 
for awards granted to employees approaching retirement eligibility  the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in compensation expense on a straight line basis over the period from the grant date through the retirement eligibility date 
stock based compensation expense for employees who will not become retirement eligible during the vesting period of the options five years is recognized on a straight line basis 
prior to the implementation of sfas no 
r  and consistent with sfas no 
 it had been our policy to recognize all stock based compensation expense over the vesting period without regard to retirement eligibility 
the accelerated recognition of compensation cost for employees who are retirement eligible or are nearing retirement eligibility under our retirement policy is applicable for all grants made on or after our adoption of safs no 
r november  
the accelerated recognition of compensation expense associated with stock option grants to retirement eligible employees in the quarter when the options are granted the first quarter of each fiscal year reduces the associated stock based compensation expense recognized in subsequent quarters

marketing expenses associated with revenue sharing arrangements with our distribution partners increased by million to million in fiscal  reflecting the increase in sales and assets under management that are subject to these arrangements 
distribution expense increased by percent in fiscal  largely as a result of increases in average closed end fund assets and other assets subject to third party distribution and revenue sharing arrangements 
service fee expense service fees we receive from sponsored funds are generally retained in the first year and paid to broker dealers after the first year pursuant to third party service arrangements

these agreements also provide us with the right to require the minority shareholders to sell their retained equity interests to us at specific intervals over time  as well as upon the occurrence of certain events such as death and permanent disability 
these purchases and sales can occur at varying times in varying amounts over the next six years  and will generally be based upon a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes  a measure that is intended to represent fair market value 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases cannot be predicted with certainty  we anticipate that the purchase of minority interests in our consolidated subsidiaries may be a significant use of cash in future years 
in the third quarter of fiscal  minority shareholders of parametric portfolio associates exercised a put option whereby units representing a percent capital interest in parametric portfolio associates were sold to us for million  increasing our capital ownership interest from to percent 
in addition  we purchased a percent interest in atlanta capital from minority interest holders for million upon exercise of a minority investor put option in the third quarter of fiscal  increasing the company s ownership interest from percent to percent 
the additional purchase price in each case was allocated between intangible assets and goodwill based on an independent valuation 
minority interest decreased by million as a result of these transactions 
in april  parametric portfolio associates announced the signing of a definitive agreement with managed risk advisors  llc  an investment management and derivatives investment advisory firm based in westport  connecticut  to merge with parametric risk advisors llc  a newly formed parametric portfolio associates affiliate 
the transaction was completed on may  parametric risk advisors is owned percent by its principals and percent by parametric portfolio associates 
pursuant to the acquisition agreements  parametric portfolio associates will have the right to require the other shareholders in parametric risk advisors to sell their equity interests to parametric portfolio associates at specific intervals over time at a price based upon a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes  a measure that is intended to represent fair market value 
in fiscal  the company exercised a call option and purchased an additional percent interest in parametric portfolio associates from minority interest holders for million  increasing the company s capital ownership interest from percent to percent 
in addition  the company purchased an additional percent interest in atlanta capital from minority interest holders for million upon exercise of a minority investor put option  increasing the company s ownership from to percent 
the additional purchase price in each case was allocated between intangible assets and goodwill based on independent valuations 
minority interest decreased by million as a result of these transactions 
on july   evm announced its intention to redeem for cash all of its outstanding exchangeable notes million principal amount at maturity with an accreted value on redemption date of million 
upon receipt of evm s notice of its intent to redeem  holders of the exchangeable notes had the option to exchange the exchangeable notes into eaton vance corp 
non voting common stock at a rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount at maturity 
all but  principal amount at maturity of the exchangeable notes were tendered for exchange into the company s non voting common stock 
evm elected to pay the holders cash in lieu of delivering stock as provided for in the indenture agreement governing the exchangeable notes 
as a result  evm paid million to holders who presented their exchangeable notes for exchange 
the remaining exchangeable notes with a principal amount at maturity of  were redeemed by the company for cash in the aggregate amount of  the redemption of the exchangeable notes described above resulted in the elimination of all of the company s then outstanding long term debt and reduced its diluted shares outstanding by million shares 
the million premium value of the shares in excess of the accreted value of the exchangeable notes was recorded as interest expense  as was million of related debt issuance costs that was written off 
approximately million of the premium value was not deductible for tax purposes 
we maintain a revolving credit facility with several banks  which expires on august  the facility  which was extended in august  provides that we may borrow up to million at libor based rates of interest that vary depending on the level of usage of the facility and our credit ratings 
the agreement contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage and requires us to pay an annual commitment fee on any unused portion 
on october   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
operating cash flows our operating cash flows are calculated by adjusting net income to reflect changes in assets and liabilities  deferred sales commissions  stock based compensation  deferred income taxes and investments classified as trading 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million in the fiscal years ended october   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal can be attributed primarily to an increase in cash provided by the purchase and sale of trading securities by consolidated mutual funds  which regularly purchase and sell securities 
in fiscal  net proceeds received from the purchase and sale of trading securities by our consolidated funds increased cash by million 
net cash provided by used for the purchase and sale of trading securities totaled million and million in fiscal and operating cash flows in were reduced by million in payments made to terminate certain closed end fund compensation agreements and million in structuring fee payments related to the offering of three closed end funds 
operating cash flows in also include the payment of million to settle an interest rate lock transaction associated with our ten year senior note offering 
we entered into the interest rate lock to hedge against movement in ten year treasury prices between the time at which the decision was made to issue the debt and the pricing of the securities 
at the time the debt was issued  we terminated the interest rate lock and settled the transaction in cash 
at termination  the interest rate lock was determined to be a fully effective cash flow hedge and the million settlement cost was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the amount recorded in other comprehensive income will ultimately be amortized over the life of the senior notes and recorded as a component of interest expense 
capitalized sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries for the distribution of our class b and class c fund shares and certain private funds increased by million in fiscal  due primarily to a percent increase in class c share sales 
capitalized sales commissions increased by million in fiscal due primarily to a percent increase in class c share sales 
we anticipate that the payment of capitalized sales commissions will continue to be a significant use of cash in the future 
investing cash flows investing activities consist primarily of the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements  the purchase of equity interests from minority investors in our majority owned subsidiaries  and the purchase and sale of investments in our sponsored mutual funds and other sponsored investment products that we do not consolidate 
cash used for investing activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  additions to equipment and leasehold improvements totaled million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal and additions reflect leasehold improvements made in conjunction with additional office space leased to accommodate the increase in headcount in those years 
investing cash flows in fiscal also reflect the purchase of an additional percent interest in parametric portfolio associates and an additional percent interest in atlanta capital for a total of million 
these purchases increased our ownership interests in parametric portfolio associates and atlanta capital to percent and percent  respectively 
fiscal and purchases of additional interests in majority owned subsidiaries totaled million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  the purchase and sale of available for sale investments resulted in a net use of cash totaling million 
in fiscal and  the purchase and sale of available for sale investments reduced investing cash flows by million and million  respectively 
financing cash flows financing cash flows primarily reflect the issuance and repayment of long term debt  the issuance and repurchase of our non voting common stock  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
financing cash flows also include proceeds from the issuance of capital stock by consolidated investment companies and cash paid to meet redemptions by minority shareholders of these funds 
cash provided by used for financing activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and in fiscal  we repurchased a total of million shares of our non voting common stock for million under our authorized repurchase programs and issued million shares of non voting common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and other employee stock purchases for total proceeds of million 
we have authorization to purchase an additional million shares under our current share repurchase authorization and anticipate that future repurchases will continue to be a significant use of cash 
our dividends per share were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we increased our quarterly dividend by percent to per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal we currently expect to continue to declare and pay comparable dividends on our voting and non voting common stock on a quarterly basis 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of ten year senior notes due in conjunction with the senior note offering  we paid approximately million in debt offering costs that will be amortized over the life of the notes and recognized as a component of interest expense 
in august  evm retired in full its then outstanding exchangeable notes with an accreted value on redemption date of million 
we made no long term debt payments in fiscal we believe that proceeds from our million senior note offering  cash provided by current operating activities and borrowings available under our million credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our short term and long term operating needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
deferred sales commissions sales commissions paid to broker dealers in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of open end funds and private funds are generally capitalized and amortized over the period during which redemptions by the purchasing shareholder are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge  which does not exceed six years from purchase 
distribution plan payments received from these funds are recorded in revenue as earned 
contingent deferred sales charges and early withdrawal charges received from redeeming shareholders of these funds are generally applied to reduce the company s unamortized deferred sales commission assets 
should we lose our ability to recover such sales commissions through distribution plan payments and contingent deferred sales charges  the value of these assets would immediately decline  as would future cash flows 
we periodically review the recoverability of deferred sales commission assets as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of deferred sales commission assets may not be recoverable and adjust the deferred sales commission assets accordingly 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisitions of atlanta capital  fox asset management and parametric portfolio associates to a single reporting unit 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we establish fair value for the purpose of impairment testing using discounted cash flow analyses and appropriate market multiples 
in this process  we make assumptions related to projected future earnings and cash flow  market multiples and applicable discount rates 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our impairment conclusion 
identifiable intangible assets generally represent the cost of client relationships and management contracts acquired 
in valuing these assets  we make assumptions regarding useful lives and projected growth rates  and significant judgment is required 
in most instances  we engage third party consultants to perform these valuations 
we periodically review identifiable intangibles for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their respective fair values  additional impairment tests are performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
accounting for income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates of the many jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  and we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
contingent tax liabilities are established when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  there is the potential that they may be successfully challenged 
these contingent tax liabilities  as well as the related interest  are adjusted regularly to reflect changing facts and circumstances 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing our taxes  changes in tax laws may result in a change to our tax position and effective tax rate 
the company classifies any interest or penalties incurred as a component of income tax expense 
deferred income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
our deferred taxes relate principally to stock based compensation expense and capitalized sales commissions paid to broker dealers 
under irs regulations  stock based compensation is deductible for tax purposes at the time the employee recognizes the income upon vesting of restricted stock  exercise of non qualified stock option grants and any disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options 
capitalized sales commission payments are deductible for tax purposes at the time of payment 
as discussed in accounting developments below  our accounting for income taxes will be impacted by the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
investments in cdo entities we act as collateral or investment manager for a number of cdo entities pursuant to management agreements between us and each cdo entity 
at october   combined assets under management in these cdo entities upon which we earn a management fee were approximately billion 
we had combined investments of million in five of these entities on october  we account for our investments in cdo entities under emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
the excess of future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method 
we review cash flow estimates throughout the life of each cdo investment pool to determine whether an impairment of its investments should be recognized 
cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of collateral securities and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities  the forecasted default rate of the collateral securities and our past experience in managing similar securities 
if the updated estimate of future cash flows taking into account both timing and amounts is less than the last revised estimate  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value 
fair value is determined using current information  notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the interest 
market yields  default rates and recovery rates used in our estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools 
in periods of rising credit default rates and lower debt recovery rates  the fair value  and therefore carrying value  of our investments in these cdo entities may be adversely affected 
our risk of loss in the cdo entities is limited to the million carrying value of the investments on our consolidated balance sheet at october  a cdo entity issues non recourse debt and equity securities  which are sold in a private offering to institutional and high net worth investors 
the cdo debt securities issued by the cdo entity are secured by collateral in the form of floating rate bank loans  high yield bonds and or other types of approved securities that the cdo entity purchases 
we manage the collateral securities for a fee and  in most cases  are a minority investor in the equity interests of the cdo entity 
an equity interest in a cdo entity is subordinated to all other interests in the cdo entity and entitles the investor to receive the residual cash flows  if any  from the cdo entity 
as a result  our equity investment in a cdo entity is highly sensitive to changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities  including changes in the forecasted default rates and any declines in anticipated recovery rates 
our financial exposure to the cdo entities we manage is limited to our interests in the cdo entities as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at grant date  is recognized over the relevant service period  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to dividend yield  volatility  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the expected life of the option 
many of these assumptions require management s judgment 
management must also apply judgment in developing an expectation of awards that may be forfeited 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
loss contingencies we continually review any investor  employee or vendor complaints and pending or threatened litigation 
the likelihood that a loss contingency exists is evaluated under the criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  through consultation with legal counsel and a loss contingency is recorded if the contingency is probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements 
there are no losses of this nature that are currently deemed probable and reasonably estimable  and thus none have been recorded in the financial statements included in this report 
inflation our assets are  to a large extent  liquid in nature and therefore we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations 
to the extent that inflation or the expectation thereof results in rising interest rates  it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial decline in the value of fixed income or equity investments could adversely affect the net asset value of funds and accounts we manage  which in turn would result in a decline in revenue

in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold for tax positions  more likely than not ie greater than percent  before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin as of november   as required 
fin provides that interest recognized as a result of the application of fin may be classified as either income taxes or interest expense 
fin further provides that any penalties recognized as a result of applying fin may be classified in the financial statements as either income taxes or another expense classification 
the classification of these items is based upon the accounting policy election of the company 
our historical accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties recognized for tax uncertainties has been to classify these amounts as income taxes 
we will continue this classification upon the adoption of fin we are continuing to evaluate the impact of fin on our financial statements and currently anticipate recognizing a charge to retained earnings of approximately million upon adoption 
in addition  we anticipate that  upon adoption  our deferred tax assets and income taxes payable will increase by approximately million on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to different types of risk  including market risk 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity and bond prices  interest rates  credit risk or currency exchange rates 
management is responsible for identifying  assessing and managing market and other risks 
in evaluating market risk  it is important to note that most of our revenue is based on the market value of assets under management 
as noted in risk factors in item a  declines of financial market values will negatively impact our revenue and net income 
our primary direct exposure to equity price risk arises from our investments in sponsored equity funds  our equity interest in affiliates and equity securities held by sponsored funds we consolidate 
our investments in sponsored equity funds and equity securities are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
equity price risk as it relates to these investments represents the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the fund shares or underlying equity securities 
the following is a summary of the effect that a percent increase or decrease in equity prices would have on our investments subject to equity price fluctuation at october  in thousands carrying value carrying value assuming a increase carrying value assuming a decrease trading equity securities available for sale securities sponsored funds investment in affiliates total our primary direct exposure to interest rate risk arises from our investment in fixed and floating rate income funds sponsored by us and debt securities held by sponsored funds we consolidate 
we considered the negative effect on pre tax interest income of a basis point percent decline in interest rates as of october  a basis point decline in interest rates is a hypothetical scenario used to demonstrate potential risk and does not represent our management s view of future market changes 
the following is a summary of the effect that a basis point percent percent decline in interest rates would have on our pre tax net income as of october  in thousands carrying value pre tax interest income impact of a basis point decline in interest rates trading debt securities available for sale securities sponsored funds total from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates associated with our debt financing 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of percent ten year senior notes due in conjunction with the offering  we entered into an interest rate lock intended to hedge against adverse treasury rate movements between the time at which the decision was made to issue the debt and the pricing of the securities 
at the time the debt was issued  we terminated the lock and settled the transaction in cash 
at termination  the lock was determined to be a fully effective cash flow hedge and the million settlement cost was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
there can be no assurance that our hedge instruments will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts on any future debt offerings 
our primary direct exposure to credit risk arises from our interests in cdo entities that are included in long term investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
as an investor in a cdo entity  we are entitled to only a residual interest in the cdo entity  making these investments highly sensitive to the default rates of the underlying issuers of the high yield bonds or floating rate income instruments held by the cdo entity 
our investments are subject to an impairment loss in the event that the cash flows generated by the collateral securities are not sufficient to allow equity holders to recover their investments 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality of the issuers underlying the collateral securities and a corresponding increase in the number of defaults  cash flows generated by the collateral securities may be adversely impacted and we may be unable to recover our investment 
our total investment in interests in cdo entities is approximately million at october   which represents our total value at risk with respect to such entities as of october  we operate primarily in the united states  and accordingly most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we also provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states  therefore  the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside of the united states 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes and currently have no material investments that would expose us to foreign currency exchange risk
