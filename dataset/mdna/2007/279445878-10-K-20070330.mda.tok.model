the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
as described at the beginning of this annual report  our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below and in the section above entitled risk factors 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements to reflect new information  events or circumstances after the date of this report  or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related footnotes included in item of this report 
unless otherwise indicated  we have retroactively adjusted all common stock related amounts in this report to reflect our one for three reverse stock split effective april  overview we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of million in  million in  and million in on february   we sold our proprietary harpin protein based technology and substantially all of our assets used in our worldwide agricultural and horticultural markets to phc for million and assumption of certain liabilities by phc  including all of our obligations under our office and manufacturing facility lease  under the cornell license and under our change in control agreement with dr 
zhongmin wei 
we believe that this sale will enable us to significantly reduce our future operating losses and liabilities  generate cash for our home and garden business and preserve the potential future value of our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
as described in more detail below  we retained the right to our cash  accounts receivable and assets relating to our home and garden business 
as part of the closing  we entered into a license and supply agreement with phc  pursuant to which phc granted us an exclusive worldwide right and license to sell harpin protein based products for the protection of plants and seed and the promotion of overall plant health in the home and garden market and a royalty free  exclusive worldwide license to use the messenger  mightyplant and harp n tek trademarks in connection with the sale of our home and garden products 
under the license and supply agreement  phc will supply us harpin proteins and harpin protein based products for our home and garden business 
we retained all liabilities associated with the home and garden business and all liabilities associated with the harpin protein technology that occurred or existed prior to february  that were not specifically assumed by phc 
our business strategy following the sale is to use any revenue generated by our home and garden business to support our continued operations while we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
we expect to incur additional net losses as we proceed with our home and garden business and as we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets 
sale of harpin protein technology to plant health care on february   under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we sold our harpin protein technology to phc for million in cash  a promissory note in the principal amount of  payable on december  and the assumption by phc of certain of the liabilities relating to or arising out of our harpin protein technology 
the promissory note has an interest rate of per annum and is secured by equipment  certain intellectual property and other assets acquired by phc and unconditionally guaranteed by phc s indirect parent  plant health care plc 
harpin protein technology includes substantially all of our assets used in the creation of plant health technology incorporating harpin proteins and the manufacture of biopesticide  plant health and nutrient products utilizing the harpin protein technology 
these assets include all intellectual property  contracts including our license agreement with the cornell research foundation crf and our office and manufacturing facility lease  equipment and inventory related to our worldwide agricultural and horticultural markets 
as a result of the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc  we believe that the discussion below regarding our results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and  except as it relates to our home and garden business  is not indicative of or relevant to an understanding of our future financial results and operations 
with respect to our financial condition and results of operations in  the sale of our harpin protein technology is expected to have the following effects product sales are expected to decrease significantly in the harpin protein technology accounted for of gross product sales in cost of goods sold is expected to decrease significantly as a result of the decrease in product sales and the elimination of idle capacity charges after february  research and development expenses are expected to decrease to less than  in selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease significantly in cash and cash equivalents increased by million on february  and are expected to increase by  on december   assuming collection in full of the promissory note 
this increase will be offset by the payment of transaction costs totaling approximately   was incurred and recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in and  was incurred and recorded in 
cash and cash equivalents also are expected to increase by  for the release of restricted cash and return of deposit by the facility lease landlord 
current inventory is expected to decrease by approximately million for inventory sold to phc 
the remaining inventory will consist primarily of finished goods used for our home and garden business 
other current assets are expected to decrease by  for equipment classified as held for sale 
property and equipment are expected to decrease by  for assets held and used 
other long term assets are expected to decrease by  for the release of restricted cash and return of deposit by the facility lease landlord 
current accrued liabilities are expected to decrease by  due to phc s assumption of certain of those liabilities 
other long term liabilities are expected to decrease to zero in due to phc s assumption of our office and manufacturing facility lease liabilities recorded for rent expense in excess of rent payments and asset retirement obligation and our liabilities to crf 
additionally  future minimum lease payments under the non cancelable office and manufacturing facility lease totaling  in   in and  in were assumed by phc as of february  all of our rights  liabilities and obligations under the exclusive worldwide license agreement with crf for certain patents  patent applications and biological material relating to harpin proteins and related technology have been assigned to phc 
the license agreement required funding of certain research and development activities at cornell university and payment of a royalty on net sales of products that incorporate the licensed technology  subject to a  minimum annual royalty payment 
effective july   the license agreement was amended to establish a development fund at crf to advance harpin technology and reduced the minimum obligation required to maintain the rights under the license agreement to contributions to the development fund of  in each of the  and license years 
we have agreed to indemnify phc and plant health care plc  and phc and plant health care plc each has agreed to indemnify us  for any damages incurred in connection with a breach of our or phc s and plant health care plc s respective representations and warranties  covenants and obligations contained in the asset purchase agreement 
we have also agreed to indemnify phc in connection with any losses relating to liabilities and obligations that we retained after the sale of the harpin protein technology  and phc and plant health care plc each has agreed to indemnify us against any losses relating to liabilities and obligations that phc assumed in connection with the purchase of the harpin protein technology or that arise in connection with the ownership and operation of the harpin protein technology after february  the indemnification obligations do not apply until the aggregate amount of losses for which any party otherwise is entitled to be indemnified exceeds  at which time the indemnified party will be entitled to be paid for the full amount of all losses  up to a maximum amount of  the principal amount of phc s promissory note 
results of operations revenues product sales revenue through resulted primarily from sales of messenger sts  n hibit  proact  mightyplant and other related products hereafter referred to collectively as harp n tek products primarily to distributors in the agricultural markets in the united states and spain 
revenues from product sales are recognized when a the product is delivered to independent distributors  b we have satisfied all of our significant obligations and c any acceptance provisions or other contingencies or arrangements have been satisfied  including whether collection is reasonably assured 
if acceptance provisions or contingencies exist  revenue is recognized after such provisions or contingencies have been satisfied 
as part of the analysis of whether all of our significant obligations have been satisfied or situations where acceptance provisions or other contingencies or arrangements exist  we consider the following elements  among others sales terms and arrangements  historical experience and current incentive programs 
our distributor arrangements provided no price protection or product return rights 
gross product sales by geographical region were year ended december  united states spain other regions product sales gross product sales revenues were million in  a decrease of from million in  which increased from million in the decrease in is a result primarily of a significant decline in sales of messenger sts in spain offset by an increase in sales of proact in the united states 
we believe the cause of lower sales in spain is the higher than expected levels of product in the distribution channel 
the increase in over is a result primarily of sales of our n hibit  proact and mightyplant in the agricultural and horticultural markets  and to a lesser extent sales growth in the home and garden market  in the united states  messenger sales in the agricultural and horticultural market in spain and agricultural and horticultural sales into other regions 
sales of new products produced over of total gross revenue in messenger sts sales in were negatively affected by us delivering approximately  ounces of free messenger sts to distributors in connection with a price reduction of messenger and the introduction of messenger sts in january sales in were made to distributors  three of which accounted for an aggregate of of net product sales 
sales in were made to distributors  five of which accounted for an aggregate of of net product sales 
sales in were made to distributors  three of which accounted for an aggregate of of net product sales 
as a result of the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc in february  we have ceased selling products to customers in the agricultural and horticultural markets and our revenue from distributors in these markets is expected to be approximately  in and zero thereafter 
sales to consumers in the home and garden market in the united states totaled  of gross product sales in   of gross product sales in and  of gross product sales in we sell our home and garden products to retail distributors  and directly to consumers over the internet 
we have no current intention to make substantial investments toward the development of our home and garden business 
in february  we received approval to sell messenger in spain 
we initiated marketing activities in march  but the approval was not received in time to meet initial sales activity 
in order to ensure that an adequate supply of messenger was quickly disbursed in the new distribution channel and to limit the amount of working capital required by our new distributors at this early stage of introduction  we granted flexible and or extended payment terms to distributors in this new market 
because of this combination of factors  revenues from product deliveries to certain distributors were deferred and are recognized as payment is received 
we recognized net revenue of  in   in and  in from product deliveries when payment was received 
gross revenues of  and cost of goods sold of  were deferred at december  and will be recognized when payment is received 
due to the growing seasons in the united states  we expect usage of our home and garden products to be highly seasonal 
based on the recommended application timing  we expect the second quarter to be the most significant period of use 
our home and garden product sales to distributors are also expected to be seasonal 
however  actual timing of orders received from distributors will depend on many factors  including the amounts of our products in distributors inventories 
sales allowances product sales revenues are reported net of applicable sales allowances  as follows year ended december  gross product sales sales allowances elimination of previously recorded sales allowance liabilities product sales  net of sales allowances sales allowances represent allowances granted to independent distributors for sales and marketing support and are based on the terms of the distribution agreements or other arrangements 
sales allowances are estimated and accrued when the related product sales are recognized or when services are provided and are paid in accordance with the terms of the then current distributor program agreements or other arrangements 
distributor program agreements expire annually  generally on december sales allowances related to sales totaled  a decrease of  from  in  which increased  from  in sales allowances as a percentage of gross product sales revenue were in  in and in sales allowances also included the reductions by  in   in and  in of sales allowance liabilities recognized in prior periods that were not paid because actual amounts earned by distributors were less than amounts previously estimated 
as a result of the sale of the harpin protein technology to phc  we expect sales allowances to be less than of sales in cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes the cost of products sold to distributors  idle capacity charges  royalty expense  shipping and handling and other costs necessary to deliver product to distributors  and the cost of products used for promotional purposes 
cost of goods sold was million in  a decrease of million from million in  which increased million from million in the decrease in compared to is a result of less product waste from manufacturing activities  lower idle capacity charges and fewer products used for promotions 
an increase in cost of products sold related to higher sales volumes in was offset by a reduction in idle capacity charges resulting from additional manufacturing activities in compared to in  we also disposed of messenger labels and boxes totaling  that were not usable due to the introduction of messenger sts and we recorded a  net reduction to cost of goods sold to adjust our warranty liability based on our current expectations of future warranty claims 
cost of goods sold includes manufacturing overhead costs incurred while our manufacturing plant was not in production of approximately million in  million in and million in the cost of products used for promotional purposes was  in   in and  in the decrease in compared to was due to the absence of new product introductions in the increase in over was primarily due the promotional product used in the introduction of n hibit and proact 
as a result of the sale of the harpin technology to phc  cost of goods sold are expected to decrease significantly in royalty expenses and idle capacity charges are expected to cease as of february  we currently expect that the cost of products used for promotional purposes will be less than  in research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  field trial  laboratory  regulatory  patent and facility expenses 
research and development expenses totaled million in  a decrease of million from million in  which decreased million from million in the decrease from to was primarily a result of lower personnel  facility  depreciation and field trial costs 
the decrease from to was primarily a result of lower facility and field trial costs  which were offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from reducing the estimated useful life of leasehold improvements and certain equipment at our research facility 
prior to terminating this facility lease in september  we were pursuing additional tenants to sublease lab and office space and we had expected to complete the sublease by december as a result of the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc  we expect research and development expenses to decrease to less than  in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses for sales and marketing  executive and administrative personnel  advertising  marketing and professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in  a decrease of million from million in  which decreased million from million in the decrease in from resulted primarily from reductions in personnel  advertising and marketing expenses and facility costs  offset by an increase in legal fees associated with sale of our harpin protein technology to phc totaling approximately  the increase in over resulted primarily from additional spending on advertising and marketing costs for the home and garden market and relating to the introduction of our new products 
as a result of the sale of harpin protein technology to phc  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease significantly in our business strategy moving forward is to use any revenues generated by our home and garden business to support our operations while we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
as described below  we plan to engage legal and accounting professionals in to validate the underlying assumptions related to our tax loss carryforwards and analyze and provide advice on the options that may be available to preserve and maximize the potential use of our deferred tax assets  as well as on potential limitations and risks of such utilization strategy 
we expect this to be an expensive and time consuming process  and we may not generate revenue from our home and garden business or otherwise attract capital to support the process for its duration 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense was recognized in the consolidated financial statements for granted stock options 
compensation expense recognized included stock options granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and the portion vesting in the period for options granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas as of december   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to nonvested stock options was approximately  and we expected to recognize compensation expense related to these stock options of approximately  in and approximately  in total stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  was  prior to the january  adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  because the stock option exercise price equaled the market price on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized for stock based compensation 
results for prior periods have not been restated  as provided for under the modified prospective method 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
options generally become exercisable over a three or four year period and  if not exercised or earlier terminated  expire ten years after the grant date 
the majority of our employees participate in our stock option program 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of our stock 
for the year ended december   the expected term of each award granted was calculated using the simplified method in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
prior to january   the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
loss on impairment of equipment and leasehold improvements we periodically review the carrying values of our property and equipment to determine whether such assets have been impaired 
an impairment loss must be recorded pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be realized from the use of such assets are less than their carrying value 
the determination of expected undiscounted net cash flows requires us to make many estimates  projections and assumptions  including the lives of the assets  future sales and expense levels  additional capital investments or expenditures necessary to maintain the assets  industry market trends and general and industry economic conditions 
our property and equipment consists primarily of assets used to manufacture and sell our products and assets used in our research and administration 
for the purpose of assessing asset impairment  we have grouped all of these assets together in one asset group because our administration and research support our manufacturing and sales activities and do not have a separate identifiable cash flow 
in the first half of  we continued to incur losses from operations and actual sales  and growth rates for the first half of were significantly lower than expected 
in reviewing our assets for impairment in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended june   we compared the carrying value of such assets to updated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of this asset group 
as a result of continuing operating losses and lower sales and growth rates in the first half of compared to forecasts  the carrying value of the group of assets exceeded undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of this asset group 
consequently  we concluded on july   that a charge for impairment to our equipment and leasehold improvements was required and a million impairment loss was recognized at june  we estimated the fair value of equipment using an orderly liquidation method and leasehold improvements were estimated to have zero fair value 
the impairment charge did not result in future cash expenditures 
in december  we completed an efficiency analysis of our manufacturing processes  including an assessment of all manufacturing equipment and its usefulness in future manufacturing operations 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a loss of million on equipment that we determined would not be used in future manufacturing operations and would be sold or disposed 
the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell of the equipment to be sold totaled  and  at december  and  respectively  and is included in other current assets on the balance sheet 
loss on write down of inventory in reviewing the impact of the sale of our harpin technology for potential asset impairments  we compared the carrying value at december  of assets sold to consideration received from phc and recorded liabilities assumed by phc on february  based on this review  the carrying value of inventory sold to phc exceeded the consideration received from phc and recorded liabilities assumed by phc and we recorded a  write down of inventory as of december  lease termination loss on september   we entered into an amendment of lease and termination agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease of  square feet of research and office space in bothell  washington 
the lease originally expired january  average annual rent and operating costs under the lease were approximately million 
the termination was effective as of august  approximately  square feet of the space subject to the lease was subleased 
the sublease had an initial term that expired in december average annual rent and operating costs under the sublease were approximately million 
in connection with the amendment of lease and termination agreement  the existing sublease was transferred to the landlord 
the lease termination resulted in a loss totaling approximately million 
the lease termination loss is comprised of a termination fee totaling million  consisting of  cash and the forfeiture of a million security deposit  other costs  and an asset impairment loss on leasehold improvements and equipment at the leased facility totaling approximately million  offset by the write off of liabilities recorded for accrued losses on facility subleases and rent expense in excess of rent payments totaling approximately million 
gain on property and equipment gain on sale of property and equipment represents the amount of sales proceeds over the recorded value of property and equipment at the time of sale 
loss on facility subleases in april  we subleased approximately  square feet of office space to another company under a five year sublease agreement 
due to declines in the real estate market  the rent we paid on the subleased space exceeded the initial rent to be collected under the sublease and we recorded a loss of  due to the subtenant s financial difficulties  the subtenant later reduced the rental payment and an additional loss of  was recorded in the subtenant vacated the space in october and we recorded an additional loss of  in based upon an estimate of the time needed to re sublease the space and expected future rents to be collected 
gain on sale of investment in the first quarter of  we sold a minority stock investment for  that resulted in a gain of  interest income interest income consists primarily of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest income totaled  in  a decrease of  from  in  which increased of  from  in the decrease in compared to was due to significantly lower average cash balances available for investment offset by slightly higher interest rates in the increase in over was due to higher interest rates in offset by lower average cash balances available for investment 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest we paid on capital leases used to finance certain equipment purchases 
no interest expense was paid in as all capital leases were settled in interest expense totaled approximately  in  a decrease of  from  in these decreases were due to lower average principal balances as we paid down the capital lease obligations 
income taxes we have generated a net loss from operations for each period since we began doing business 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes  which expire between and  and net operating loss carryforwards in us states that range between million to  per state and expire between and our total us general business credit carryforwards were approximately million and expire between and we have also accumulated approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in mexico that expire between and and approximately million in france  of which million expires in and and million does not expire 
we have provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because of the significant uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize value on such assets 
our business strategy is to use any revenue generated by our home and garden business to support our continued operations while we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
the strategy is extremely speculative and subject to a large number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
we have conducted only limited preliminary analysis of our ability to utilize of our tax loss carryforwards and have drawn no final conclusions about the viability of this strategy 
we have not developed any specific plan as to whether  how or within what time frame we might pursue or implement this strategy 
in order to confirm whether there are opportunities to realize potential value from our tax loss carryforwards  we plan to engage legal and accounting professionals during to validate the underlying assumptions related to our tax loss carryforwards and analyze and provide advice on the options that may be available to preserve and maximize the potential use of our tax loss carryforwards  as well as on potential limitations and risks of such utilization strategy 
this will be an expensive and time consuming process  and we may not generate revenue from our home and garden business or otherwise attract capital to support the process for its duration 
in the event we were to undergo an ownership change as defined in section of the code  our net tax loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations  which could reduce  eliminate  or defer the utilization of these losses 
based upon a preliminary review of past changes in our ownership  we believe that we may have experienced one ownership change as defined under section in october that would result in a limitation on our future ability to use tax loss carryforwards generated prior to that date 
we do not believe that the sale of assets to phc resulted in another ownership change that would further limit our future ability to use tax loss carryforwards generated after october however  we cannot assure you that the irs or some other taxing authority may not disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced other such ownership changes 
in such case  our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be severely limited 
if the sale of assets to phc were deemed to result in an ownership change as defined in section of the code  our tax loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income could be limited to approximately  or less per year and the remainder of the tax loss carryforwards would expire as a result of the limitation 
if an ownership change is not deemed to occur as a result of the sale to phc  there is still the potential for an ownership change to occur under section as a result of future changes in stock ownership 
net operating loss carryforwards may expire if we do not generate sufficient income to utilize the losses before their normal expiration 
generally  an ownership change occurs if one or more shareholders  each of whom owns or more in value of a corporation s stock  increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders at any time during the preceding three year period 
for example  if a single shareholder owning of our stock acquired an additional of our stock in a three year period  a change of ownership would occur 
similarly  if ten persons  none of whom owned our stock  each acquired slightly over of our stock within a three year period so that such persons own  in the aggregate  more than an ownership change would occur 
ownership of stock is determined by certain constructive ownership rules which can attribute ownership of stock owned by entities such as estates  trusts  corporations  and partnerships to the ultimate indirect owner 
for purposes of this rule  all holders who each own less than of a corporation s stock are generally treated together as one or  in certain cases  more than one shareholder 
transactions in the public markets among shareholders owning less than of the equity securities generally are not included in the calculation 
special rules can result in the treatment of options including warrants or other similar interests as having been exercised if such treatment would result in an ownership change 
as we explore whether there may be opportunities to utilize our tax loss carryforwards  due to the importance of avoiding a future ownership change under the tax laws  we will be limited in our ability to issue additional stock in the future to provide capital for our business 
we would only be able to issue such additional stock in a manner that would not cause an ownership change  for purposes of these rules  and thus our ability to access the equity markets could be restricted 
finally  in addition to section  certain other statutory provisions and common law doctrine could limit our opportunities to realize potential value from  or otherwise adversely affect our ability to preserve and utilize  our tax loss carryforwards 
the use of our tax loss carryforwards is subject to uncertainty because it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income we generate 
we have no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax loss carryforwards before they expire 
we believe that our ability to achieve profitability may depend in substantial part on our ability to identify and acquire suitable acquisitions on favorable terms  so that we can increase our revenues and generate new income 
we may seek additional capital from time to time  including through the sale of stock or other securities  which may result in dilution to existing shareholders 
in addition  as noted above  the provisions of the code and certain applicable irs regulations will limit the number of shares of stock we can sell from time to time without causing a limitation on our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax obligations 
liquidity and capital resources our operating expenditures have been significant since our inception 
we currently anticipate that our operating expenses in  although substantially less than our operating expenses in  will significantly exceed net home and garden product sales and that net losses and working capital requirements will consume a material amount of our cash resources in as described above  our future capital requirements will depend on the success of our home and garden business and our ability to successfully implement our strategy of realizing potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
we have no current intention to make substantial investments to grow our home and garden business 
we believe that the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for net losses  working capital and capital expenditures for more than the next months  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million from the balance of million at december  in the first quarter of  we received million in net proceeds after transaction costs from the sale of the harpin protein technology to phc and we expect to collect an additional  upon payment of the promissory note in december prior to october  we financed our operations primarily through the private sale of our equity securities  resulting in net proceeds of million through september  in october  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the initial public offering of  shares of our common stock 
to a lesser extent  we have financed our equipment acquisitions through lease financings 
we plan to finance our operations in using existing cash and cash equivalents 
as discussed in detail above and in the section entitled risk factors risks related to our business plan to utilize tax loss carryforwards  our business strategy of exploring whether there may be opportunities to utilize our remaining business assets  including our tax loss carryforwards  will  due to the importance of avoiding a future ownership change under the tax laws  limit us in our ability to issue additional stock to provide capital for our business 
net cash used in operations totaled million in  a decrease of million from million in  which decreased million from million in net cash used in operations of million in resulted primarily from net loss of million  which includes loss on impairment of equipment  leasehold improvements and inventory  depreciation and amortization  deferred rent payable  gain on property and equipment  gain on sale of investment and stock compensation expense totaling million  and fluctuations in various asset and liability balances totaling  net cash used in operations of million in resulted primarily from net loss of million  which includes depreciation and amortization  loss on termination of lease and loss on property and equipment totaling million  and fluctuations in various asset and liability balances totaling  net cash used in operations of million in resulted primarily from net loss of million  which includes depreciation and amortization and loss on subleases totaling million  and fluctuations in various asset and liability balances totaling million 
we expect that cash used in operations in  although substantially less than our cash used in operations in  will continue to be significant 
we believe that the sale of our harpin protein technology will have the following effects on our cash used in operations and cash resources in cash and cash equivalents increased by  on february  and are expected to increase by  on december   assuming collection in full of the promissory note 
this increase will be offset by the payment of transaction costs totaling approximately   was incurred and recorded in and  was incurred and recorded in 
cash and cash equivalents also are expected to increase by  for the release of restricted cash and return of deposit by the manufacturing and office facility lease landlord 
current inventory is expected to decrease by approximately  for inventory sold to phc 
the remaining inventory will consist primarily of finished goods used for our home and garden business 
other current assets are expected to decrease by  for equipment classified as held for sale 
property and equipment are expected to decrease by  for assets held and used 
other long term assets are expected to decrease by  for the release of restricted cash and return of deposit by the facility lease landlord 
current accrued liabilities are expected to decrease by  due to phc s assumption of certain of those liabilities 
other long term liabilities are expected to decrease to zero in due to phc s assumption of the manufacturing and office facility lease liabilities recorded for rent expense in excess of rent payments and asset retirement obligation and the liability to crf 
product sales  cost of goods sold  research and development and selling  general and administrative expense are expected to decrease significantly in additionally  future minimum lease payments under the non cancelable office and manufacturing facility lease totaling  in   in and  in were assumed by phc as of february  we currently have no contractual obligations associated with capital and operating lease obligations 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled  in   in and  in and resulted primarily from proceeds from the sale of equipment and  in  the sale of an investment 
net cash provided by financing activities in totaled  and represents proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  in  a reduction of  from  in the primary use of cash for financing activities during and was to pay down principal on our outstanding capital leases  offset by proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in connection with our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we conduct our operations in three primary functional currencies the us dollar  the euro and  until december   the mexican peso 
historically  neither fluctuations in foreign exchange rates nor changes in foreign economic conditions have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exposures and are  therefore  subject to the risk of exchange rates 
we may invoice our international customers in us dollars or euros  as the case may be 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on our financial results in  or as of december   we changed the functional currency of our mexican subsidiary from the mexican peso to the u 
s 
dollar due to lower activity in mexico and the majority of transactions being denominated in us dollars 
as of december   we had severance agreements with two employees  dr 
zhongmin wei  our former chief science officer  and bradley s 
powell  our president and chief financial officer 
these severance agreements require us to make severance payments equal to six months annual base salary if we terminate the executive s employment without cause  as defined in the agreements 
dr 
wei s severance agreement terminated on february   when he resigned from eden bioscience  and mr 
powell s severance agreement continues in effect 
if we were required to make payments on mr 
powell s agreement  severance payments would total approximately  as of december   we also had change in control agreements with dr 
zhongmin wei  our former chief science officer  and bradley s

critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our critical accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  commonly accepted industry practices  information provided by our customers and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition prior to the sale of our harpin protein technology assets in february  we sold the majority of our products to independent  third party distributors in the agricultural and horticultural markets 
our arrangements with those distributors provide no price protection or product return rights 
we recognize revenue from product sales  net of sales allowances  when product is delivered to our distributors and all of our significant obligations have been satisfied  unless acceptance provisions or other contingencies or arrangements exist  including whether collection is reasonably assured 
if acceptance provisions or contingencies exist  revenue is recognized after such provisions or contingencies have been satisfied 
as part of the analysis of whether all of our significant obligations have been satisfied or situations where acceptance provisions or other contingencies or arrangements exist  we consider the following elements  among others sales terms and arrangements  including customer payment terms  historical experience and current incentive programs 
sales allowances represent allowances granted to independent distributors for sales and marketing support and are based on the terms of the distribution agreements or other arrangements 
sales allowances are estimated and accrued when the related product sales are recognized or when services are provided and are paid in accordance with the terms of the then current distributor program agreements or other arrangements 
we also record  at the time revenue is recognized  a liability for warranty claims based on a percentage of sales 
the warranty accrual percentage  which has ranged between zero and five percent  and warranty liability are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary  based on historical experience  the results of product quality testing and future expectations 
changes in our estimate of the warranty liability are recorded in cost of goods sold 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable balances are reported net of customer specific related sales allowances 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a number of factors  including the age of outstanding invoices  customer payment trends  the financial condition of our customers  historical bad debts and current economic trends 
based upon our analysis of outstanding net accounts receivable at december   no allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded 
changes in the factors above or other factors could result in a significant charge 
inventory valuation and classification our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market on an average cost basis 
we regularly review inventory balances to determine whether a write down is necessary 
we consider various factors in making this determination  including recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions  general economic conditions  the age of our inventory and recent quality control data 
changes in the factors above or other factors could result in significant inventory cost reductions and write offs 
in reviewing for asset impairment in connection with the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc  we compared the carrying value at february  of assets sold to consideration received from phc and recorded liabilities assumed by phc 
based on this review  the carrying value of inventory sold to phc exceeded the consideration received from phc and recorded liabilities assumed by phc 
accordingly  we recorded a  charge for impairment to inventory as of december  we also review our inventory to determine inventory classification 
inventory expected to be utilized in the next twelve month period is classified as current and inventory expected to be utilized beyond that period is classified as non current 
in determining the classification of inventory  we consider a number of factors  including historical sales experience and trends  existing distributor inventory  expansion into new markets  introduction of new products and estimates of future sales growth 
valuation of property and equipment we periodically review the carrying values of our property and equipment to determine whether such assets have been impaired 
an impairment loss must be recorded pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be realized from the use of such assets are less than their carrying value 
the determination of undiscounted net cash flows expected requires us to make many estimates  projections and assumptions  including the lives of the assets  future sales and expense levels  additional capital investments or expenditures necessary to maintain the assets  industry market trends and general and industry economic conditions 
our property and equipment consists primarily of assets used to manufacture and sell our products and assets used in our research and administration 
for the purpose of assessing asset impairment  we have grouped all of these assets together in one asset group because our administration and research support our manufacturing and sales activities and do not have a separate identifiable cash flow 
we continued to incur losses from operations and actual sales and growth rates for the first half of were significantly lower than expected 
in reviewing for impairment in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended june   we compared the carrying value of such assets to updated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset group 
as a result of continuing operating losses and lower sales and growth rates in the first half of compared to forecasts  the carrying value of the group of assets exceeded undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of this asset group 
consequently  we concluded on july  that a charge for impairment to our equipment and leasehold improvements was required and a million impairment loss was recognized at june  we estimated the fair value of equipment using an orderly liquidation method and leasehold improvements were estimated to have zero fair value 
in december  we completed an efficiency analysis of our manufacturing processes  including an assessment of all manufacturing equipment and its usefulness in future manufacturing operations 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a loss of million on equipment that we determined would not be used in future manufacturing operations and would be sold or disposed 
the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell equipment to be sold totaled  and  at december  and  respectively  and is included in other current assets on the balance sheet 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized  measured and derecognized in financial statements  requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified in the balance sheet  and provides transition and interim period guidance  among other provisions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and  as a result  is effective for the company beginning january  we do not expect the impact of fin to be significant to the consolidated financial statements at adoption  principally because of the full valuation against our net deferred assets 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning with fiscal year we are in the process of assessing the effect sfas no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and we do not engage in hedging activities 
also  we do not have any outstanding variable interest rate debt and currently do not enter into any material transactions denominated in foreign currency 
because of the relatively short term average maturity of our investment funds  such investments are sensitive to interest rate movements 
therefore  our future interest income may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from cash equivalents is not material
