item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that judgments and estimates related to the following critical accounting policies could materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors including the customer s financial condition and collection history  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory we estimate the carrying value of our inventory based upon historic usage and management s assumptions relating to projected customer purchases  product design changes and product obsolescence 
the changing technology markets that we supply also affect these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
we must estimate our income tax valuation allowance by assessing which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be recovered in the future 
based on our assessment of the realization of these assets  we have recorded a valuation allowance of  at december  in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  taxable income in prior carryback years and taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents amounted to  at december   an increase of  over the december  level 
during  our continuing operations provided cash of  investing activities used cash of  financing activities provided cash of  and discontinued operations used cash of  cash provided from continuing operations was  for compared to  in operating cash flows during resulted mainly from net earnings of  net adjustments of  for the non cash effects of depreciation  deferred income taxes and stock compensation expense and the  net reduction in our components of working capital 
the net decrease in working capital was mainly due to a  reduction in inventory and an increase in current liabilities of  offset in part by a  increase in accounts receivable  net 
the decrease in inventory was mainly due to orders being filled from existing inventory and the continuing control over inventory purchases and levels 
the net increase in current liabilities is mainly due to a  increase in accounts payable partially offset from an  reduction in accrued liabilities 
the increase in accounts payable is mainly attributable to the timing of inventory and capital equipment purchases 
the reduction in accrued liabilities is mainly due to a  reduction in incomes taxes payable  mainly as a result of payments due on the tax return  offset in part by an  increase in employee compensation and benefits and a  increase in commissions due to outside sales representatives 
the increase in accounts receivable was mainly due to the increase in the current year s fourth quarter sales over capital expenditures amounted to  in our budget for capital expenditures is approximately  during the year  we sold machinery and equipment and received  in cash proceeds 
we believe that based on our current working capital and the expected cash flows from operations  our resources are sufficient to meet our financial needs and to fund our capital expenditures for the projected levels of business in results of operations versus net sales increased  or over the sales increase is mainly attributable to higher sales in the buy and resell product line resulting from higher bookings in the year 
the overall actual number of units sold in this product line increased about over  however  the average selling price decreased about 
sales of our domestic products increased slightly over last year as the number of units sold decreased from the level while the overall average selling price increased 
for  total bookings were  or higher than the backlog at december  amounted to  versus  million at december  we continue to see price compression in the buy and resell product line and in our older domestic products and we believe this pricing pressure will continue in the future 
in addition  our near term visibility continues to be poor and we continue to see customer orders for small quantities with near term delivery dates 
we are not sure of the potential impact on its future operations from the current continuing telecom market uncertainties  the industry wide over capacity issues  and the effects of the continuing pricing compression 
we reported a  gross profit of net sales in versus a  gross profit of net sales in the higher margin was mainly attributable to an decrease in raw material costs due to changes in product mix toward the more value added  high reliability  and higher margin products and product yield improvements 
direct labor as a percentage of sales decreased from mainly as a result of changes in product mix 
overhead costs as a percentage of sales in remained fairly consistent with that in selling and advertising expenses increased  or over this overall expense increase was mainly due to higher personnel expenses of  a  increase in sales commission expense to outside manufacturers representatives  a  increase in travel and entertainment expense  and the recognition of  of stock based compensation expense partially offset by expense reductions of  in advertising  and  in telephone expense 
general and administrative expenses increased  or over mainly as a result of the recognition of  of stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses increased  or over primarily as a result of increased personnel expenses 
the expense increases are consistent with our plans to make significant engineering investments in new product development in the increase in interest income over is due mainly to higher interest rates during the current year and to a lesser extent higher average cash balances 
the combined federal and state income tax rate for was compared to in the lower rate in is due to a combination of a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes and the reversal of accrued income taxes offset by the effect of the nondeductible stock compensation expense resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the majority of the stock option expense results from incentive stock options and under sfas no 
r  the expense does not generate a tax deduction and related tax benefit 
we reduced the valuation allowance by  in based on our assessment of the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
as we have state income tax nol carryforwards available  there is no estimated state income tax provision for and we reported an operating profit of  during compared to an operating profit of  in the operating profit in was reduced by  for stock option expense resulting from our adoption of sfas no

r on a modified prospective method  does not include any stock option expense 
interest income amounted to  in compared to  in we reported a pre tax profit of  from continuing operations in compared to a pre tax profit of  in for  we reported net earnings of  from continuing operations versus net earnings of  in we reported after tax losses of  in and  in from discontinued operations 
in total  we reported net earnings of  in versus net earnings of  in results of operations versus net sales decreased  or from mainly due to lower sales of manufactured products 
sales in the buy and resell product line increased slightly over the level 
during  the actual number of units sold has decreased about from the prior year  as we continue to move to more value added  high reliability high rel products with higher overall average selling prices and higher margins 
the book to bill ratio during was  versus in our backlog amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  while we experienced some modest growth in our principal market telecommunication infrastructure in  it was offset by overall price compression and our conscious effort to discontinue low margin product 
we believe that we will continue to be challenged by price compression and the industry wide excess capacity issues in and beyond 
in addition  our near term visibility continues to be poor and we continue to see customer orders for small quantities with near term delivery dates 
we reported a  gross profit of net sales in versus a  gross profit of net sales in the higher margin was mainly attributable to decreases in raw material costs due to changes in product mix toward the more value added  high rel products with higher selling prices as well as some yield improvements 
direct labor and overhead costs as a percentage of sales in the remained fairly consistent with that in selling and advertising expenses were comparable to that in decreases in personnel and benefit expenses of  and travel and entertainment expenses of  were offset by a  increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in bad debt expense over the amount was mainly due to the expense provision benefiting from the  recovery of accounts receivable written off in prior years 
general and administrative expenses decreased  from mainly as a result of a reduction in personnel and benefit expenses 
research and development expenses increased  over primarily as a result of increased personnel and benefit expenses 
this expense increase was consistent with our plan to make significant engineering investments in new product development in the increase in interest income for over was due to a combination of higher average cash balances and higher interest rates during the current year 
during  we sold equipment and realized a  gain

during  we reported an operating profit of  compared to an operating loss of  in the  improvement in operating performance over was due to the  increase in gross margin in offset in part by a  increase in operating expenses

words such as expects  believes  estimates  plans or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are based on our current views and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties that include  but not limited to our ability to continue to achieve profitability  the current production over capacity within the suppliers of frequency control devices  the ability to develop  market and manufacture new innovative products competitively  the fluctuations in product demand of the telecommunications industry  our ability  including our suppliers to produce and deliver materials and products competitively  the ability to limit the amount of the negative effect on operating results caused by pricing pressure  and our ability to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin prescribes how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
we are currently evaluating our tax positions and do not expect this interpretation will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not yet determined the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements to address the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
we adopted sab no 
in the fourth quarter of and there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash balances in excess of operating requirements are currently invested in money market accounts 
these money market accounts are subject to interest rate risk and interest income will fluctuate in relation to general money market rates 
based on the cash and cash equivalent balance at december   and assuming the balance was totally invested in money market instruments for the full year  a hypothetical point increase or decline in interest rates would result in an approximate  increase or decrease in interest income 
we purchase certain inventory from and sell product in foreign countries 
as these activities are currently transacted in us dollars  they are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
however  significant fluctuation in the currencies where we purchase inventory or sell product could make the us dollar equivalent of such transactions more or less favorable to us and the other involved parties
