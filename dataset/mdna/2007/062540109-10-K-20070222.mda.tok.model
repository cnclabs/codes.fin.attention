critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require assumptions or judgments to be made based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates 
those policies have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than reported if there is a change to any of the estimates  assumptions  or judgments made by management 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements of the valuation methods  estimates  assumptions  and judgments used  management identified the determination of the reserve for credit losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  the valuation of leased asset residual values  the valuation of pension and postretirement obligations  and the determination of income tax expense and liability to be the accounting estimates that are the most subjective and or judgmental 
reserve for credit losses a consequence of lending activities is that we may incur losses 
the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions  including rising interest rates  and the financial performance of borrowers 
the company maintains a reserve for credit losses which consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance and a reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve 
the reserve for credit losses provides for the risk of credit losses inherent in the credit extension process and is based on a range of loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation  reflecting analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience  supplemented as necessary by credit judgment to address observed changes in trends  conditions  and other relevant environmental and economic factors  plus an amount for imprecision of estimates 
the allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
the determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios  and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
on a quarterly basis  senior level committees approve specific credit and reserve related activities 
also  on a quarterly basis  the audit committee of the board of directors reviews and approves the reserve for credit losses prior to final affirmation by the board of directors 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes further discussion and information on the reserve for credit losses  is incorporated herein by reference 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights when mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values 
once mortgage servicing rights have been recorded  they must be periodically evaluated for impairment 
under current accounting guidance  impairment occurs when the current estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights is less than the book value 
the current estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  loan repayment rates  costs to service  and interest rates that reflect the risk involved 
the value of the company s mortgage servicing rights is sensitive to changes in the estimates and assumptions made 
had the company assumed lower long term interest rates and higher loan repayment rates  the value of the mortgage servicing rights could have been lower than recorded in the company s consolidated statements of condition 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes further discussion and information on mortgage servicing rights  including a sensitivity analysis  is incorporated herein by reference 
residual valuation of leased assets lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expiration 
the determination of residual value is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals  and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until termination  the cyclical nature of equipment values  and the limited marketplace for re sale of certain leased assets  are important variables considered in making this determination 
the company updates its valuation analysis on an annual basis  or more often when events or circumstances warrant 
when it is determined that a residual value is higher than the expected fair value at lease expiration  the difference is recorded as an asset impairment in the period in which the analysis was completed 
the company is unable to predict future events or conditions that could result in future residual value impairments 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes further discussion and information on the residual value of leased assets  is incorporated herein by reference 
pension and postretirement benefit plans the company s pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on the following key assumptions discount rate  estimated future return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
the determination of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash out flows for benefit payments and cash in flows for maturities and returns on plan assets 
changes in estimates and assumptions related to mortality rates and future health care costs could also have a material impact to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
the discount rate used to value the future benefit obligation as of each year end is the rate used to determine the periodic benefit cost in the following year 
the discount rate of used for the december  valuations was determined based on match funding maturities and interest payments on corporate bonds available in the market place to projected cash flows for future benefit payments 
in determining the net periodic benefit cost  the company lowered the discount rate to in from used in and used in  reflecting the decline in market interest rates during these periods 
the estimated return on plan assets of was based on historical trends and a building block approach taking into account the type of plan assets in the pension plan 
the health care cost trend rate for was and is assumed to decrease annually until reaching the ultimate trend rate of in a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the total pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december  by approximately million and the benefit obligations as of december  by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the total pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december  by approximately million and the benefit obligations as of december  by million 
a change in the health care cost trend rate would have changed the net periodic benefit cost by approximately million 
the estimated pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december  is million  based on an assumed discount rate of 
a basis point change in the discount rate for would change the total pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost by approximately million 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes further discussion and information on the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans  is incorporated herein by reference 
income taxes the company determines its liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulation and interpretations 
congress  tax authorities  and courts can and do change tax policy 
accordingly  previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted  through the provision for income taxes 
this process requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the impact of changes in such estimates is not subject to quantification

analysis of business segments the company s business segments are retail banking  commercial banking  investment services  and treasury 
the company s internal management accounting process measures the performance of the business segments based on the management structure of the company 
this process  which is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution  uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement amounts to the business segments  including allocations of income  expense  the provision and capital 
this process is dynamic and requires certain allocations based on judgment and other subjective factors 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management accounting that is equivalent to us generally accepted accounting principles 
the company evaluates several performance measures of the business segments  the most important of which are net income after capital charge niacc and risk adjusted return on capital raroc 
niacc is economic net income less a charge for the cost of allocated capital 
the cost of allocated capital is determined by multiplying management s estimate of a shareholder s minimum required rate of return on the cost of capital invested currently by the segment s allocated equity 
the company assumes a cost of capital that is equal to a risk free rate plus a risk premium 
raroc is the ratio of economic net income to risk adjusted equity 
equity is allocated to each business segment based on an assessment of its inherent risk 
the net interest income of the business segments reflects the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics and reflects the allocation of net interest income related to the company s overall asset and liability management activities on a proportionate basis 
the basis for the allocation of net interest income is a function of management decisions and assumptions that are subject to change based on changes in current interest rate and market conditions 
funds transfer pricing also serves to transfer interest rate risk to the treasury 
however  the other business segments have some latitude to retain certain interest rate exposures related to customer pricing decisions within guidelines 
the business segments are charged an economic provision which is a statistically derived estimate of average annual expected credit losses over an economic cycle 
the company considers niacc to be a measure of shareholder value creation 
the company s niacc for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in the company s niacc from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was primarily due to a lower capital charge and economic provision 
allocated net income remained relatively unchanged from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase in the company s niacc from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was primarily due to a higher allocated net income and a lower capital charge 
financial results for each of the company s segments are presented in table and note to the consolidated financial statements  which are incorporated herein by reference

this segment s assets and liabilities and related interest income and expense consist of interest bearing deposits  investment securities  federal funds sold and purchased  government deposits and short term and long term borrowings 
the primary sources of noninterest income are from bank owned life insurance and foreign exchange income related to customer driven currency requests from merchants and island visitors 
the net residual effect of transfer pricing of assets and liabilities is included in treasury  along with eliminations of inter company transactions 
the decline in the segment s key financial measures from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was primarily due to lower net interest income partially offset by lower noninterest expenses and capital charges 
the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher funding costs associated with the company s deposit portfolio and increases in both rate and volume of short term borrowings 
noninterest expense decreased due to a reduction in share based compensation expense 
the capital charge was favorably impacted by a reduction of the company s excess capital  a result of the company s ongoing share repurchase program 
the segment s financial measures for the year ended december  remained relatively unchanged from the year ended december   although net interest income and noninterest income decreases were offset by a decrease in noninterest expense 
the reduction in net interest income was due to the impact on the treasury unit of funding higher average deposit balances 
noninterest income decreased due to reduced income from bank owned life insurance and the sale of a parcel of land in noninterest expense decreased during the year ended december  due to reductions in share based compensation and separation expense 
the other organizational units of the company technology  operations  marketing  human resources  finance  credit and risk management  and corporate and regulatory administration provide a wide range of support to the company s other income earning segments 
expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the business segments through an internal cost allocation process

loans and leases loans and leases represent the company s largest category of interest earning assets and the largest source of revenue 
the company s loan and lease portfolio is divided into commercial and consumer components 
the commercial loan and lease portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans  commercial mortgages  construction loans  and lease financing 
commercial and industrial loans are extended primarily to corporations  middle market  and small businesses 
the purpose of these loans is for working capital needs  acquisitions  equipment  or other expansion projects 
commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors  developers  and builders primarily domiciled in hawaii 
commercial mortgages are secured by real estate 
the source of repayment for investor property is cash flow from the property and for owner occupied property it is operating cash flow from the business 
construction loans are for the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property 
lease financing consists of direct financing leases and leveraged leases 
the company s commercial loan and lease portfolio increased by million or from december  the increase from december  was experienced in all categories of commercial loans and leases  and was primarily due to continued economic growth in the company s key markets 
although the company s primary market is hawaii  the commercial portfolio contains loans to some borrowers based on the continental united states mainland including some shared national credits

this deposit is in addition to a million deposit placed by the company with the irs in  also relating to the initial disallowance of the lilo and silo transactions 
the placement of the deposits reduced the accrual of additional interest associated with the potential underpayment of taxes related to these transactions 
the company believes its tax position related to these transactions was proper based on applicable statutes  regulations  and case law at the time the transactions were entered into 
also contributing to the increase in other assets was a million increase in bank owned life insurance from december  to december  the increases in other assets were partially offset by a million decrease in prepaid pension costs and a million decrease in low income housing investments

the company s credit risk position remained stable and strong during the year ended december  with low levels of internally criticized loans and leases and non performing assets 
the ratio of non accrual loans and leases to total loans and leases as of december  was  unchanged from december  net loans and leases charged off during the year ended december  as a percent of average loans and leases outstanding was  a decrease from for the year ended december  the decrease in the charge off ratio was primarily due to commercial loan charge offs decreasing from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the company charged off a million leveraged lease in the third quarter of following the bankruptcy announcement of a national air carrier 
this leveraged lease charge off was fully reserved for in the allowance 
the company s favorable credit risk profile reflects a generally strong economy in hawaii and the mainland with improving economic conditions in guam 
hawaii s construction  real estate  and domestic tourism industries have remained strong during  despite higher energy prices and increasing inflationary trends 
the company has also maintained a practice of disciplined commercial and consumer underwriting and portfolio management 
relative to the company s total loan and lease portfolio  domestic airline carriers continued to demonstrate a higher risk profile due to fuel costs  pension plan obligations  and marginal pricing power 
management continues to consider the conditions within the airline industry  which appear to have improved  in its evaluation of the company s reserve for credit losses

allowance for loan and lease losses the company s allowance was million as of december   a decrease of million from december  the components of the allowance  including the allocation between commercial and consumer categories  have also remained relatively unchanged from december  to december  based on management s ongoing assessment of the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and the economic environment  the company recorded a provision of million for the year ended december  as compared to a provision of million for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference  for changes in the reserve for credit losses during the last five years 
the ratio of the allowance to total loans and leases outstanding was as of december   a decrease from as of december  the reduction of the ratio was indicative of strong economic conditions and lower inherent losses in the portfolio driven by conservative underwriting and portfolio management standards in conjunction with funded loan and lease growth 
the improvement in credit quality was reflected in lower net loans and leases charged off for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   as well as lower levels of npas as of december  compared to december  net loans and leases charged off for the year ended december  of million or of total average loans and leases  decreased from million or of total average loans and leases for the year ended december  net loans and leases charged off for the year ended december  included a million charge off of a fully reserved aircraft lease 
excluding the effects of the million charge off  net loans and leases charged off for the year ended december  were million or of total average loans and leases 
although the company determines the amount of each component of the allowance separately  the allowance was considered adequate by management as of december   based on its ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses  credit risk profiles  economic conditions  coverage ratios  and other relevant factors

management believes that the unfunded reserve sufficiently provides for exposures related to commitments to extend credit  banker s acceptances  and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the process used to determine the unfunded reserve is consistent with the process for determining the allowance as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities or loan and lease equivalency factors 
market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the company is exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting its business activities 
financial products that expose the company to market risk include investment securities  loans  leases  deposits  debt  and derivative financial instruments 
the company s market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling  and managing risks that can significantly impact the company s statements of income and condition 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance  while limiting volatility 
the activities associated with these market risks are categorized into trading and other than trading 
the company s trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose the company to a small degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers and at times for the company s own account 
the company s other than trading activities include normal business transactions that expose the company s balance sheet profile to varying degrees of market risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
a key element in the process of managing market risk involves oversight by senior management and the board of directors as to the level of such risk assumed by the company on its consolidated statement of condition 
the board of directors reviews and approves risk management policies  including risk limits and guidelines  and delegates oversight functions to the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco  consisting of senior business and finance officers  monitors the company s market risk exposure and  as market conditions dictate  modifies positions on the company s statement of condition 
the alco may also direct the company to use derivative financial instruments  as deemed prudent 
interest rate risk the objective of the company s interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity 
the company s statement of condition is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from the company s normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many other factors also affect the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  historical pricing relationships  and repricing characteristics of financial instruments 
the earnings of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the monetary policies of the frb influence  to a significant extent  the overall growth of loans  leases  investment securities  and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable 
in managing interest rate risk  the company  through the alco  measures short term and long term sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
the alco utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk  which include shifting balance sheet mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities  changing product pricing strategies  modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio  or using derivative financial instruments 
the use of derivative financial instruments  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference  has generally been limited over the past several years 
this is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans  leases  and investment securities with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
in particular  the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by alco 
in addition  interest rate sensitive off balance sheet exposures such as mortgage servicing rights have offsetting income effects with other fee income items such as mortgage origination fees 
natural and offsetting hedges reduce the need to employ off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures 
expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk 
thus  as interest rates change  the company may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk 
a key element in the company s ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset liability simulation model 
this model is used to estimate and measure the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan  lease  and deposit pricing  repayment rates on mortgage based assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model s analytics include the effects of embedded options 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  management believes that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the simulation model attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the balance sheet and provide a sophisticated estimate rather than a precise prediction of exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company utilizes net interest income simulations to analyze short term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
table presents  over the next twelve months from december    and  an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual and basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve  relative to the measured base case scenario for net interest income without any change in strategy 
based on the net interest income simulation as of december   the company s consolidated statement of condition is approximately neutral to parallel changes in interest rates 
net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  was less sensitive to changes in interest rates as compared to the sensitivity profile as of december  and to analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner  non parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated 
these non parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve stay inverted for a period of time 
conversely  if the yield curve should become positively sloped from its current flat to inverted profile  net interest income may increase 
net interest income sensitivity profile table change in net interest income from december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points the company also uses a market value of portfolio equity mvpe sensitivity to estimate the net present value change in the company s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements from changes in interest rates 
the mvpe was approximately billion as of december    and table presents  as of december    and  an estimate of the change in the mvpe sensitivity that would occur from an instantaneous and basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve 
the mvpe sensitivity increased in higher interest rate scenarios and decreased in lower interest rate scenarios as of december  compared to december  as a result of the relative shift in the funding source for asset growth and the flat or inverted yield curve during further enhancing the mvpe sensitivity analysis are value at risk  key rate analysis  duration of equity  and the exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures  however  used along with the mvpe sensitivity analysis  the company obtains better overall insight for managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
based on the additional analyses  the company estimates its greatest exposure is in scenarios where medium term rates rise on a relative basis more than short term and long term rates 
market value of equity sensitivity profile table change in market value of equity december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points liquidity management liquidity is managed in an effort to ensure that the company has continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funding 
funding requirements are impacted by loan refinancings and originations  liability settlements and issuances and off balance sheet funding commitments 
the company considers and complies with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitors its liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  the company may alter its assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet positions 
the alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with the company s ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to ensure that its liquidity needs are met  the company actively manages its assets and liabilities 
the potential sources of short term liquidity from assets include interest bearing deposits as well as the ability to sell certain assets including investment securities available for sale 
assets generate long term liquidity through cash flows from investment securities  loans  and leases 
with respect to liabilities  short term liquidity is generated from securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term funding sources such as federal funds while long term liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and long term debt 
for the year ended december   the company continued to use excess cash to repurchase shares and to reduce debt where possible 
capital management the parent and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies
