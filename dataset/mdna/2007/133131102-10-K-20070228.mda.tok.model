these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report 
executive summary based on our results for the year ended december  and the projected economic conditions  we expect moderate growth during from the revenue generated by our stabilized communities 
the economic projections include meaningful job growth and population growth in a number of markets in which we operate and decreased housing demand due to rising interest rates resulting in multifamily apartment communities being an economically attractive alternative to purchasing a single family home and positively affecting apartment housing demand 
we intend to continue to focus on our market balance investment strategy and to improve our portfolio mix through the acquisition and disposition of real estate assets 
we expect market concentration risk to be mitigated as our property operations are not centralized in any one market 
in positioning for future growth  we intend to continue focusing on our development pipeline and maintain approximately billion to billion in our current and future development pipelines 
total projected capital costs and the commencement of future developments may be impacted by increasing construction costs and other factors

table of contents funds from operations ffo management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from depreciable operating property sales  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all dilutive convertible securities  including convertible minority interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation

liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and preserving our financial flexibility  which we believe enhances our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available 
we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and common and preferred equity  extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where possible  managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt  borrowing on an unsecured basis in order to maintain a substantial number of unencumbered assets  and maintaining conservative coverage ratios 

table of contents our interest expense coverage ratio  net of capitalized interest  was  and times for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense coverage ratio is derived by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of income from continuing operations before gain on sale of properties  equity in income loss of joint ventures and minority interests  depreciation  amortization  interest expense and income from discontinued operations

for unsecured notes  we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of those notes will be repaid prior to maturity 
additionally  as of december   we had several development projects in various stages of construction  for which a total estimated cost of million remained to be funded

net cash provided by operating activities increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increases were primarily due to additional property revenues from recently acquired properties and growth in property revenues from our stabilized communities

this million unsecured line of credit was originally scheduled to mature in january in january  we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement to extend the maturity by two years to january and to amend certain covenants 
the scheduled interest rate is based on spreads over the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
the scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change 
advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates  or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates 
these bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations  all of which we were in compliance with at december  our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit 
while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line  it does reduce the amount available 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  and had million available  under our unsecured line of credit 
as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit  we from time to time borrow using competitively bid unsecured short term notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group

the interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates and our line of credit were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december  the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded with secured  third party debt 
we are not committed to any additional funding on third party debt in relation to our joint ventures 
we are committed to funding an additional million under mezzanine loans provided to joint ventures 
we have guaranteed our proportionate interest on construction loans in three of our development joint ventures 
see further discussion of our investments in various joint ventures in note to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from to months 
in an inflationary environment  we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases 
the short term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse affects of inflation 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those most important to the presentation of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we follow financial accounting and reporting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
income recognition 
our rental and other property income is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned 
other property income consists primarily of utility rebillings  and administrative  application and other transactional fees charged to our residents 
retail lease income is recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term  including any construction period if we are determined not to be the owner of the tenant improvements 
interest  fee and asset management and all other sources of income are recognized as earned 
capital expenditures 
we capitalize renovation and improvement costs we believe extend the economic lives and enhance the earnings of the related assets 
capital expenditures  including carpet  appliances and hvac unit replacements  subsequent to initial construction are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
accounting for joint ventures 
we make co investments with unrelated third parties and are required to determine whether to consolidate or use the equity method of accounting for these ventures 
fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities as revised and emerging issues task force no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights are two of the primary sources of accounting guidance in this area 
appropriate application of these relatively complex rules requires substantial management judgment 
asset impairment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash 
table of contents flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows and costs to sell  an impairment charge equal to the excess is recognized 
cost capitalization 
real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges 
carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development 
expenditures directly related to the development  acquisition and improvement of real estate assets  excluding internal costs relating to acquisitions of operating properties  are capitalized at cost as land  buildings and improvements 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits and other related costs attributable to the development of properties  are also capitalized 
all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported on the balance sheet in properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed 
upon substantial completion of the apartment homes  the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land  respectively  and the assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
where possible  we stage our construction to allow leasing and occupancy during the construction period  which we believe minimizes the duration of the lease up period following completion of construction 
our accounting policy related to properties in the development and leasing phase is all operating expenses associated with completed apartment homes are expensed 
allocations of purchase price 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we allocate the purchase price between tangible and intangible assets  which includes land  buildings  furniture and fixtures  the value of in place leases  including above and below market leases  and acquired liabilities 
when allocating the purchase price to acquired properties  we allocated costs to the estimated intangible value of in place leases and above or below market leases and to the estimated fair value of furniture and fixtures  land and buildings on a value determined by assuming the property was vacant by applying methods similar to those used by independent appraisers of income producing property 
depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight line basis over the remaining useful lives of the related assets 
the value of in place leases and above or below market leases is amortized over the estimated average remaining life of leases in place at the time of acquisition 
estimates of fair value of acquired debt are based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  results of operations during the reporting periods and related disclosures 
our more significant estimates relate to determining the allocation of the purchase price of our acquisitions  estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying value of our real estate assets  estimates of the useful lives of our assets  reserves related to co insurance requirements under our property  general liability and employee benefit insurance programs and estimates of expected losses of variable interest entities 
future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment
