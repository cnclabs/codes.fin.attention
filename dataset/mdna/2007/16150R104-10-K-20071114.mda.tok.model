critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and require management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
in cases where the company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to it  a specific allowance against amounts due to the company is recorded  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and its historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have an adverse impact on the future operating results of the company 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
the company estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions and records reserves to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  trademarks  patents and agreements and property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
the company reviews long lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
factors which the company considers important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company determines whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows  and measures the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimates of expected cash flows require the company to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of the company s control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment which is typically when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of its obligation is complete  its price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and the company is reasonably assured of collecting 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment due to insolvent customers 
the company analyzes various factors  including a review of specific customer contracts and shipment terms  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
commissions are recognized when earned and payments are received from the manufacturers represented 
royalty revenue is recognized based on licensee production statements received from the authorized manufacturers 
billed shipping and handling fees are recorded as sales revenue with the associated costs recorded as costs of products and services sold 
deferred income taxes the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
pension benefits the company sponsors a non contributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all employees of certain businesses of the company 
in calculating its retirement plan obligations and related expense  the company makes various assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions include discount rates  benefits earned  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension obligations and future expense 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
in the event of significant inflation  the company s efforts to recover cost increases would be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which it operates 
forward looking information from time to time  the company may publish  verbally or in written form  forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
in fact  this form k or any other periodic reporting documents required by the act may contain forward looking statements reflecting the current views of the company concerning potential future events or developments
