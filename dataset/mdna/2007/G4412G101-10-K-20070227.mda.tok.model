item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  each included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a global network marketing company that sells weight management  nutritional supplement and personal care products 
we pursue our mission of changing people s lives by providing a financially rewarding business opportunity to distributors and quality products to distributors and their customers who seek a healthy lifestyle 
we are one of the largest network marketing companies in the world with net sales of approximately billion for the year ended december  we sell our products in countries through a network of over million independent distributors 
in china  in order to comply with local legislation  we sell our products through retail stores and an employed sales force 
we believe the quality of our products and the effectiveness of our distribution network  coupled with geographic expansion  have been the primary reasons for our success throughout our year operating history 
we offer products in three principal categories weight management products  nutritional supplements which we refer to as targeted nutrition and personal care products which we refer to as outer nutrition 
our products are often sold in programs  which are comprised of a series of related products designed to simplify weight management and nutrition for consumers and maximize our distributors cross selling opportunities 
industry wide factors that affect us and our competitors include the increasing prevalence of obesity and the aging of the worldwide population  which are driving demand for nutrition and wellness related products and the recruitment and retention of distributors 
the opportunities and challenges upon which we are most focused are retailing of our products  recruitment and retention of distributors and improving distributor productivity  new markets  further penetrating existing markets including china  globalizing successful distributor methods of operation such as nutrition clubs  introducing new products  developing niche market segments and further investing in our infrastructure 
in july  we changed our geographic units from four to seven units as part of our on going realignment for growth efforts 
these changes are intended to create growth opportunities for our distributors  support faster decision making across the organization by reducing layers of management  improve the sharing of ideas and tools and accelerate growth in our high potential markets 
under the new geographic units we report revenue from north america  which consists of the us  canada  jamaica and the dominican republic  mexico and central america  which consists of mexico  costa rica and panama  brazil  south america and southeast asia  which includes new zealand and australia and excludes brazil  emea  which consists of europe  the middle east and africa  
table of contents greater china  which consists of china  taiwan and hong kong  and north asia  which consists of japan and korea 
historical information presented related to our geographic units has been reclassified to conform with our current geographic presentation 
a key non financial measure we focus on is volume points on a royalty basis  or volume points  which is essentially our weighted unit measure of product sales volume 
it is a useful measure for us  as it excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and ignores the differences generated by varying retail pricing across geographic markets 
in general  an increase in volume points in a particular group or country directionally indicates an increase in local currency net sales 
volume points by geographic unit for the year ended december  change change change volume points in millions north america mexico central america brazil south america southeast asia emea greater china north asia worldwide number of new supervisors by geographic unit as of reporting period another key non financial measure on which we focus is the number of distributors qualified as new supervisors under our compensation system 
distributors qualify for supervisor status based on their volume points 
the growth in the number of new supervisors is a general indicator of the level of distributor recruitment  which generally drives net sales in a particular country or group 
as of december  change change change north america mexico central america brazil south america southeast asia emea greater china north asia worldwide number of supervisors and retention rates by geographic unit as of requalification period our compensation system requires each supervisor to re qualify for such status each year  prior to february 
in february of each year  we delete from the rank of supervisor those distributors who did not satisfy the supervisor qualification requirements during the preceding twelve months 
distributors who meet the supervisor requirements 
table of contents at any time during the year are promoted to supervisor status at that time  including any supervisors who were deleted  but who subsequently requalified 
number of supervisors supervisors retention rate north america mexico central america brazil south america and southeast asia emea greater china north asia worldwide supervisors must requalify annually 
the requalification period covers the twelve months starting in february and ending the following january 
the number of supervisors by geographic unit as of the reporting dates will normally be higher than the number of supervisors by geographic unit as of the requalification period because supervisors who do not requalify during the relevant twelve month period will be dropped from the rank of supervisor the following february 
for the latest twelve month re qualification period ending january  approximately percent of our supervisors re qualified 
in order to increase retailing of our products  we modified our requalification criteria in to retain more supervisors 
since supervisors purchase most of our products for resale to other distributors and consumers  comparisons of supervisor totals on a year to year  same period basis are good indicators of our recruitment and retention efforts in different geographic units 
the value of the average monthly purchase of herbalife products by our supervisors has remained relatively constant over time 
consequently  increases in our sales are driven primarily by our retention of supervisors and by our recruitment and retention of distributors  rather than through increases in the productivity of our overall supervisor base 
we provide distributors with products  support material  training  special events and a competitive compensation program 
if a distributor wants to pursue the herbalife business opportunity  the distributor is responsible for growing his or her business and personally pays for the sales activities related to attracting new customers and recruiting distributors by hosting events such as herbalife opportunity meetings or success training seminars  by advertising herbalife s products  by purchasing and using promotional materials such as t shirts  buttons and caps  by utilizing and paying for direct mail and print material such as brochures  flyers  catalogs  business cards  posters and banners and telephone book listings  by purchasing inventory for sale or use as samples  and by training  mentoring and following up  in person or via the phone or internet  with customers and recruits on how to use herbalife products and or pursue the herbalife business opportunity 
presentation retail sales represent the gross sales amounts on our invoices to distributors before distributor allowances as defined below  and net sales  which reflect distribution allowances and handling and freight income  represent what we collect and recognize as net sales in its financial statements 
we discuss retail sales because of its fundamental role in our compensation systems  internal controls and operations  including its role as the basis upon which distributor discounts  royalties and bonuses are awarded 
in addition  it is used as the basis for certain information included in daily and monthly reports reviewed by our management 
however  such a measure is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
you should not consider retail sales in isolation from  nor as a substitute for  net sales and other consolidated income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
a reconciliation of net sales to retail sales is presented below under results of operations 
product sales represent the actual product purchase price paid to us by our distributors  after giving effect to distributor discounts referred to as distributor allowances  which approximate of retail sales prices 
distributor allowances as a percentage of sales may vary by country depending upon regulatory restrictions that limit or otherwise restrict distributor allowances 

table of contents our gross profit consists of net sales less cost of sales  which represents the prices we pay to our raw material suppliers and manufacturers of our products as well as costs related to product shipments  duties and tariffs  freight expenses relating to shipment of products to distributors and importers and similar expenses 
royalty overrides are our most significant expense and consist of royalty overrides and production bonuses which total approximately and  respectively  of the retail sales of weight management  targeted nutrition  outer nutrition and promotional products  the mark hughes bonus payable to some of our most senior distributors in the aggregate amount of up to of retail sales of weight management  targeted nutrition  outer nutrition and promotional products  and other discretionary incentive cash bonuses to qualifying distributors 
royalty overrides are generally earned based on retail sales  and approximate in the aggregate about of retail sales or approximately of our net sales 
royalty overrides together with distributor allowances represent the potential earnings to distributors of up to approximately of retail sales 
the compensation to distributors is generally for the development  retention and improved productivity of their distributor sales organizations and is paid to several levels of distributors on each sale 
due to restrictions on direct selling in china  our full time employed sales representatives in china are compensated with wages  bonuses and benefits instead of the distributors earnings  distributor allowances and royalty overrides 
because of local country regulatory constraints  we may be required to modify our typical distributor incentive plans as described above 
consequently  the total distributor discount percentage may vary over time 
we also offer reduced distributor allowances and pay reduced royalty overrides with respect to certain products worldwide 
our operating margins consist of net sales less cost of sales and royalty overrides 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent our operating expenses  components of which include labor and benefits  sales events  professional fees  travel and entertainment  distributor marketing  occupancy costs  communication costs  bank fees  depreciation and amortization  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
most of our sales to distributors outside the united states are made in the respective local currencies 
in preparing our financial statements  we translate revenues into us dollars using average exchange rates 
additionally  the majority of our purchases from our suppliers generally are made in us dollars 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar versus a foreign currency can have a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margins and can generate transaction losses on intercompany transactions 
throughout the last five years  foreign currency exchange rates have fluctuated significantly 
from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk 
summary financial results net income for the year ended december  increased to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for the increase was driven by revenue growth primarily in mexico and the us markets  lower interest expense following a debt refinancing in july and a lower effective income tax rate 
net income for included million additional interest expense related to the refinancing arrangements in july  a million tax benefit resulting from an international income tax settlement  a million additional tax benefit from refinancing transactions  a million favorable impact of the adjustment to income tax accrual and a million unfavorable after tax impact in connection with the re alignment for growth plan in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a million expense in connection with the adoption of the new accounting rules for stock based compensation and a million charge for the continued build out of china infrastructure

table of contents net sales for the year ended december  increased to  million from  million in the increase reflects the continued retailing success from distributors using the nutrition club operating method in mexico and us  who have adopted similar methods 
another large distributor group within the us had significant success with a retailing model that focus on generating sales leads from mailing free samples to potential customers 
the growth in the two markets accounted for of the overall increase in net sales 
brazil and other south american countries also experienced significant sales growth while net sales in southeast asia were up primarily due to the opening of malaysia in january we have continued our expansion in the chinese market and now have stores in provinces and we expect to have over stores in more than provinces at the end of the expansion in china resulted in a million increase in net sales and a overall increase for the greater china region 
net sales in the other regions  europe and north asia  were flat and down  respectively  when compared to net sales in overall  the appreciation of foreign currencies had a million favorable impact on net sales in representing about of the total sales increase 
results of operations our results of operations for the periods described below are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for future periods  which depend upon numerous factors  including our ability to recruit new distributors and retain existing distributors  open new markets and further penetrate existing markets  and introduce new products and programs that will help our distributors increase their retail efforts  and develop niche market segments 
the following table sets forth selected results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated

management s role  both in country and at the corporate level is to provide distributors with a competitive and broad product line  encourage strong teamwork and leadership among the chairman s club and president s team distributors and offer leading edge business tools to make doing business with herbalife simple 
management uses the distributor marketing program coupled with educational and motivational tools and promotions to incentivize distributors to increase recruiting  retention and retailing  which in turn affect net sales 
such tools include corporate sales events such as extravaganzas and world team schools where large groups of distributors gather  thus allowing them to network with other distributors  learn recruiting  retention and retailing techniques from our leading distributors and become more familiar with how to market and sell our products and business opportunities 
accordingly  management believes that these development and motivation programs can increase the productivity of the supervisor network 
the expenses for such programs are included in selling general administrative expenses 
sales are driven by several factors  including the number and productivity of distributors and supervisors who continually build  educate and motivate their respective distribution and sales organizations 
we also use event and non event product promotions to motivate distributors to increase recruiting  retention and retailing activities 
these promotions have prizes ranging from qualifying for events to prizes and vacations 
the costs of these promotions are included in selling  general administrative expenses 
the factors described above have helped distributors increase their business  which in turn has driven growth in our business 
the following net sales by geographic unit discussion further details some of the above factors and describes unique growth factors specific to certain major countries 
we believe that the correct business foundation  coupled with ongoing training and promotional initiatives is required to increase recruiting and retention of distributors and retailing our products 
the correct business foundation includes strong country management that works closely with the distributor leadership  unified distributor leadership  a broad product line that appeals to local consumer needs  a favorable regulatory environment  a scalable and stable technology platform and an attractive distributor marketing plan 
initiatives such as success training seminars  world team schools  promotional events and regional extravaganzas are integral components of developing a highly motivated and educated distributor sales organization that will work toward increasing the recruitment and retention of distributors 

table of contents our strategy will continue to include creating and maintaining growth within existing markets while expanding into new markets 
we expect to increase our spending in selling  general administrative expenses to maintain or stimulate sales growth  while making strategic investments in new initiatives and in new markets 
in addition  new ideas and distributor business methods are being generated in our regional markets  either by distributors  country management or corporate management 
examples are the nutrition clubs in mexico  the total plan in brazil  the wellness coach in france  the sampling program in the us  and generation herbalife  or genh  in the many markets  as described under net sales below 
management s strategy is to review the applicability of expanding successful country initiatives throughout a region and or globally and where appropriate  and financially support the globalization of these initiatives 
north america net sales in north america increased million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to in local currency  net sales increased by for the year ended december   as compared to the fluctuation of foreign currency rates had a positive impact of million on net sales for the year ended december  the overall increase was a result of net sales growth in the us of million  or  for the year ended december  the us continues to benefit from strong retailing  especially from an increasing latino distribution base  the improved retention of the distributor force that retails our products and a product line and business opportunity that is attractive to the demographics in this country 
in the us we have also expanded branding efforts to include sponsorship of the avp volleyball tour  the bay to breakers run  the amgen tour of california bicycle race  the aeg home depot center in torrance  ca  and the nautica triatholon  and various new promotions including the active world team promotion and the president team challenge 
in we introduced several new products  including a convenient water mixable version of our top selling formula one shake  a reformulated and reduced retail price version of our garden tm product  nourifusion personal care line in individual use packets and most recently launched best defense and skin activator line extensions 
we believe that the above activities were critical to maintain and expand upon the positive momentum  created within the us distributors sales force 
we believe that sales in north america will continue its positive year over year growth primarily as a result of the expected continuation of strong momentum in the us the rapid success and expansion of the nutrition club daily method of operation  or dmo  and increased distribution focus on providing samples of product in individual use packets 
to further support the retailing and recruiting efforts of our distributors  we plan to open a new sales center in phoenix  az during the first quarter of and  in particular  to stimulate sales within the vicinity of the new sales center 
mexico and central america net sales in mexico and central america for the year ended december  increased million  or  as compared to in local currency  net sales for the year ended december  increased by  as compared to the fluctuation of foreign currency rates had an unfavorable impact of million on net sales for the year ended december  the overall increase was a result of net sales growth in mexico of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the increase in new supervisors along with continued expansion of distributors adopting the nutrition clubs dmo contributed to the net sales growth in mexico and improved the distributor retention rate to and supervisor growth  up at december   as compared to december  we estimate that distributors are operating approximately  nutrition clubs in mexico 
during we opened an additional sales center in mexico city  held a presidents team tour attended by approximately  distributors  hosted the mexico extravaganza in mexico city  which was attended by over  distributors and held two active supervisor schools  which approximately  distributors attended 
additionally  we relocated our mexico headquarters and main warehouse in guadalajara and plan to open a new sales center in the mexico city to support the expansion of our business 
during december  we held several supervisor training schools  which over  distributors attended 

table of contents we believe that the full year sales in mexico and central america will be flat as compared to sales levels 
we believe that the root causes of this declining in the year over year growth rate are related to infrastructure  training and distributor business practice issues 
we have outlined an infrastructure plan to double distributor access points to our products and improve their overall customer service experience 
in the fourth quarter of we added three new third party sales centers and intend to add another six in the first half of to improve our product availability in remote areas 
we have developed a comprehensive training plan with our mexican distributor leadership to improve the quality of service to their nutrition club customers and are also implementing an extensive training and compliance auditing program surrounding our nutrition club dmo to promote distributor best practices that we believe are hampering our nutrition club growth 
we believe that these efforts should result in mexico sales regaining momentum towards the second half of the year that should bring the full year net sales levels even with full year brazil net sales in brazil increased million or for the year ended december   as compared to in local currency  net sales increased by for the year ended december   as compared to the fluctuation of foreign currency rates had a favorable impact of million on net sales for the year ended december  the net sales growth trend in brazil is a result of strong supervisor growth  up at december   as compared to  strong distributor leadership  a highly effective country management team and the introduction of a new distributor promotion launched in the third quarter of in addition  expansion of the total plan lead generation method and the introduction of the nutrition club method  or dmo  in this market have been key catalysts for growth 
during the year we held a world team school attended by over  distributors and launched the nourifusion personal care line 
additionally  we held our brazil extravaganza during december  which approximately  distributors attended 
we believe the sales in brazil will continue its positive year over year growth primarily as a result of the increase in the nutrition club dmo and plans to refine our product portfolio to help us compete more aggressively in the personal care industry by leveraging our product knowledge and the total plan dmo  as well as expanding locally manufactured products 
although net sales in brazil are expected to increase in on a year over year basis  we began experiencing a slower revenue growth rate in that is expected to continue through south america and southeast asia net sales in south america and southeast asia increased million or for the year ended december   as compared to in local currency  net sales increased for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of the fluctuation of foreign currency rates had a million favorable impact on net sales for the year ended december  the overall increase was attributable mainly to net sales increases in colombia  argentina  venezuela and bolivia and the opening of malaysia in february as a new market

during this process we also opened our first sales center in the netherlands 
additionally  during the third quarter an extravaganza was held in athens  greece and was attended by over  distributors from over countries and we held a regional world team school in lisbon and portugal  which approximately  world and tab members attended 
the net sales increases in portugal  france  and spain continued  primarily due to a well balanced performance across distributor retailing  recruiting and retention efforts  a united distributor leadership working closely with the local management  and a program focus on the total plan 
in addition  there has been an increasing emphasis on good health and nutrition in france  which is supported and promoted by local nutritionists 
during the year two nutrition advisory board members were appointed in france and spain 
the decline in germany was primarily driven by a loss of momentum resulting in a decrease in supervisors  down at december   as compared to december  in germany  a recently constituted strategy group comprised of distributor leaders and regional management has focused on turnaround initiatives  both in business activity as well as brand building and new product introductions 
significant distributor training has been undertaken  concentrating on long term customers  nutrition clubs and wellness coaching dmo s 
in addition  improved distributor communications has been a key focus and new online tools are being provided 
the net sales decline in the netherlands was primarily driven by lower recruiting of new distributors 
a reconstituted distributor strategy group  working closely with regional management  is focused on initiatives to reverse that trend 
these included a national supervisor recruitment drive  the launch of liftoff tm in june  a highly successful spring spectacular event and the appointment of a member of the global nutritional advisory board 
while progress is being made  the turnaround is expected to be slow in germany and the netherlands and net sales for are expected to be below the levels of for these countries 
we expect net sales in emea to be flat when compared to we have identified several high potential markets such as russia and poland for which we are developing strategic initiatives along with our distributors to grow sales and increase local branding activities 
this includes sponsoring the london triathlon  the moscow marathon  the italian beach volleyball championship  the nice ironman triathlon and the madrid triathlon  which are intended to continually improve our corporate and brand reputation in the market 
we are also enhancing distributor communication processes and training  and  we have the introduction of some new products into the region  most notably liftoff tm 
liftoff tm was introduced in markets in the emea group during additionally  we launched formula cookies cream at the lisbon world team school

net sales in hong kong decreased million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the decline in net sales was primarily the result of a loss of momentum  attributable to the focus on the emerging opportunity in china  resulting in a decrease in supervisors  down at december   as compared to december  we believe the sales in greater china will continue positive year over year growth primarily as a result of the continued expansion of our retail presence and continued efforts to enhance our product portfolio in china 
we expect to have over stores in more than provinces at the end of we are currently awaiting approval of our direct selling license in china  which  once approved will allow sales growth to accelerate in china 
north asia north asia net sales decreased million or for the year ended december   as compared to in local currency  net sales decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the fluctuation of foreign currency rates had a unfavorable impact of million on net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales in north asia was attributable to the decrease in net sales in japan discussed below 
net sales in japan decreased million or  for the year ended december   as compared to the decline in sales is primarily attributable to increased competition from new companies entering the market 
in spite of the decrease in net sales  the number of new distributors and the supervisor retention rate are improving when compared to the same period last year 
the improved retention rate was caused by an increase in the number of distributors taking advantage of the modified re qualification criteria 
we believe the sales in north asia will begin to have positive year over year growth 
we believe the modified re qualification criteria along with a new sales center in osaka  new products  and local promotions will lead to increased sales in we plan to remain focused on reinvigorating our distributor leadership and exporting successful dmos into this market

due to the launch of these products together with the continued positive sales momentum discussed above  net sales of weight management products and targeted nutrition products increased at a higher rate than that for the entire company 
net sales declines in outer nutrition reflects country mix along with distributors shifting their procedures to products sold in their dmo primarily nutrition clubs 
we expect shifts within these categories from time to time as we launch new products and as new dmo s shift buying patterns 
gross profit gross profit was  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit for the year ended december  remained flat at as compared to the same period of generally  gross profit percentages do not vary significantly as a percentage of net sales other than due to product or country mix  currency fluctuation  importation and product cost and provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory

royalty overrides royalty overrides as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december   as compared to in the same period of the increase for the year ended december  was primarily due to a favorable pre tax impact of million relating to a change in the allowance for uncollectible royalty overrides receivables from distributors in the third quarter of generally  this ratio varies slightly from period to period due to changes in the mix of products and countries because full royalty overrides are not paid on certain products and in certain countries

the increases were partially offset by million lower amortization expenses and million lower advertising and promotion expenses

we will begin to see labor savings in resulted from our realignment for growth plan completed in the fourth quarter of as a result of these initiatives  selling general administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales should remain at or below levels

such tools include corporate sales events extravaganzas and world team schools where large groups of distributors gather  thus allowing them to network with other distributors  learn recruiting  retention and retailing techniques from our leading distributors  and become more familiar with how to market and sell our products and business opportunities 
accordingly  management believes that these development and motivation programs can increase the productivity of the supervisor network 
the expenses for such programs are included in selling general administrative expenses 
sales are driven by several factors  including the number and productivity of distributor supervisors who continually build  educate and motivate their respective distribution and sales organizations 
we also use event and non event product promotions to motivate distributors to increase recruiting  retention and retailing activities 
these promotions have prizes ranging from qualifying for events to vacations and qualification parties for distributors that meet certain selling and recruiting goals 
the costs of these promotions are included in selling  general administrative expenses 
the factors described above have driven growth in our business 
the following net sales by geographic region discussion further details some of the above factors and describes unique growth factors specific to certain major countries 
the company believes that the correct business foundation  coupled with ongoing training and promotional initiatives is required to increase recruiting and retention of distributors and retailing of the company s products 
the correct business foundation includes strong country management that works closely with the distributor leadership  unified distributor leadership  a broad product line that appeals to local consumer needs  a favorable regulatory environment  a scalable and stable technology platform and an attractive distributor marketing

herbalife international  inc  et al 
the complaint alleges that certain telemarketing practices of certain herbalife international distributors violate the telephone consumer protection act  or tcpa  and seeks to hold herbalife international vicariously liable for the practices of its distributors 
more specifically  the plaintiffs complaint alleges that several of herbalife international s distributors used pre recorded telephone messages to contact prospective customers in violation of the tcpa s prohibition of such practices

we currently maintain product liability insurance with an annual deductible of million 
certain of our subsidiaries have been subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in their respective countries 
in certain of these tax audits  governmental authorities are proposing that significant amounts of additional taxes and related interest and penalties are due 
we and our tax advisors believe that there are substantial defenses to their allegations that additional taxes are owed  and we are vigorously contesting the additional proposed taxes and related charges 
these matters may take several years to resolve  and we cannot be sure of their ultimate resolution 
however  it is the opinion of management that adverse outcomes  if any  will not likely result in a material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
this opinion is based on our belief that any losses we suffer would not be material and that we have meritorious defenses 
although we have reserved an amount that we believe represents the likely outcome of the resolution of these disputes  if we are incorrect in our assessment we may have to record additional expenses

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are a network marketing company that sells a wide range of weight management products  nutritional supplements and personal care products within one industry segment as defined under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our products are manufactured by third party providers and then sold to independent distributors who sell herbalife products to retail consumers or other distributors 
we sell products in countries throughout the world and we are organized and managed by geographic region 
in the first quarter of  we elected to aggregate our operating segments into one reporting segment  as management believes that our operating segments have similar operating characteristics and similar long term operating performance 
in making this determination  management believes that the operating segments are similar in the nature of the products sold  the product acquisition process  the types of customers products are sold to  the methods used to distribute the products  and the nature of the regulatory environment 
revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the independent distributor or importer 
amounts billed for freight and handling costs are included in net sales 
we generally receive the net sales price in 
table of contents cash or through credit card payments at the point of sale 
related royalty overrides and allowances for product returns are recorded when the merchandise is shipped 
allowances for product returns  primarily in connection with our buyback program  are provided at the time the product is shipped 
this accrual is based upon historic return rates for each country and the relevant return pattern  which reflects anticipated returns to be received over a period of up to months following the original sale 
historically  product returns and buybacks have not been significant 
product returns and buybacks were approximately  and of retail sales for the years ended december   and respectively 
no material changes in estimates have been recognized for the year ended december  or for the years ended december  and respectively 
we record reserves against our inventory to provide for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions  additional reserves could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if previously reserved for inventory is sold 
we reserved for obsolete and slow moving inventory totaling million  million and million as of december   and respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangibles not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill and other intangibles over the implied fair value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and other intangibles 
as of december   we had goodwill of approximately million  and marketing franchise of million 
no write downs were recognized for the year ended december  goodwill was reduced in by approximately million due primarily to the effect of the settlement of an international tax audit related to the pre acquisition period and the realization of pre acquisition net operating losses 
contingencies are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use judgment 
many of these legal and tax contingencies can take years to be resolved 
generally  as the time period increases over which the uncertainties are resolved  the likelihood of changes to the estimate of the ultimate outcome increases 
deferred income tax assets have been established for net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and have been reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect them at amounts estimated to be ultimately recognized 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts over a future period of time 
realization of the income tax carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to 
table of contents expiration of the carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net carrying value of the income tax carryforwards will be realized 
the amount of the income tax carryforwards that is considered realizable  however  could change if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are adjusted 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock award exercise behaviors 
our expected volatility is primarily based upon the historical volatility of herbalife s common stock and  due to the limited period of puclic trading data for its common stock  it is also validated against the volatility of a company peer group 
the expected life of awards is based on observed historical exercise patterns  which can vary over time 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estiemated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience
