item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we research and develop biopharmaceutical products based on our patented dna delivery technologies for the prevention and treatment of serious or life threatening diseases 
we believe the following areas of research offer the greatest potential for our product development efforts vaccines for use in high risk populations for infectious disease targets for which there are significant us needs  vaccines for general pediatric  adolescent and adult populations for infectious disease applications  and cancer vaccines or immunotherapies which complement our existing programs and core expertise 
we currently have four active independent development programs in the areas of infectious disease and cancer including a phase clinical trial using our allovectin immunotherapeutic in patients with metastatic melanoma which is being funded by anges through cash payments and equity investments  under a research and development agreement  a phase clinical trial using our cmv dna vaccine in hematopoietic cell transplant patients  a phase clinical trial of electroporation enhanced delivery of il utilizing our delivery technology with an initial indication in metastatic melanoma  and a pandemic influenza dna vaccine candidate using our proprietary vaxfectin as an adjuvant expected to begin phase clinical testing in we have leveraged our patented technologies through licensing and collaborations  such as our licensing arrangements with merck  sanofi aventis  and anges  among other research driven biopharmaceutical companies 
in  the first product for one of our licensees utilizing our patented dna delivery technology received approval for use in animals 
our licensee  aqua health  an affiliate of novartis animal health  received approval from the canadian food inspection agency to sell a dna vaccine to protect farm raised salmon against an infectious disease 
we believe this approval is an important step in the validation of our dna delivery technology 
the nih has clinical stage vaccine programs based on our technology in five infectious disease targets hiv  pandemic influenza  ebola  wnv  and sars 
we work with the nih under cradas and license agreements to further develop our technology 
under the agreements  the nih fully funds the programs while in certain cases we maintain commercialization rights 
in addition  we have licensed complementary technologies from leading research institutions and pharmaceutical companies  as well as the nih and the us cdc 
we also have granted non exclusive  academic licenses to our dna delivery technology patent estate to ten leading research institutions including stanford  harvard  yale and mit 
the non exclusive academic licenses allow university researchers to use our technology free of charge for educational and internal  non commercial research purposes 
in exchange  we have the option to exclusively license from the universities potential commercial applications stemming from their use of the technology on terms to be negotiated 
research  development and manufacturing programs to date  we have not received revenues from the sale of our independently developed pharmaceutical products and have received minimal amounts of revenue from the sale of commercially marketed products by our licensees 
we earn revenue by performing services under research and development contracts  grants  manufacturing contracts  and from licensing access to our proprietary technologies 
since our inception  we 
table of contents estimate that we have received approximately million in revenue under these types of agreements 
revenues by source for each of the three years ended december   were as follows in millions source nih contracts cmv grants influenza grants anthrax grants us navy contract other contracts and grants total contract and grant revenues sanofi aventis licenses merck license anges license invitrogen royalties other royalties and licenses total royalty and license revenues total revenues research  development  manufacturing and production costs by major program  as well as other expenses for each of the three years ended december   were as follows in millions program cmv allovectin influenza anthrax il ep other research  development  manufacturing and production total research  development  manufacturing and production since our inception  we estimate that we have spent approximately million on research  development  manufacturing and production 
our current independent development focus is on novel dna vaccines for cmv and our cancer immunotherapeutics allovectin and il ep  as well as other preclinical targets such as influenza 
we have initiated a phase clinical trial using allovectin in patients with recurrent metastatic melanoma which is being funded by anges through cash payments and equity investments under a research and development agreement 
we are also in the early stages of clinical development of vaccine candidates for cmv and our il ep program for solid tumors and these programs will require significant additional costs to advance through development to commercialization 
from inception  we have spent approximately million on our cmv program  and approximately million on our il ep program 
we are currently performing research testing of vaccine candidates for human and avian influenza under separate grants 
we have several other product candidates in the research stage 
it can take many years from the initial decision to screen product candidates  perform preclinical and safety studies  and perform clinical trials leading up to possible approval of a product by the fda or comparable foreign agencies 
the outcome of the research is unknown until each stage of the testing is completed  up through and including the registration clinical trials 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential product candidates we may proceed with  the time and cost to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have a product approved by the fda or comparable foreign agencies 

table of contents for instance  we have spent approximately million from inception on our allovectin program 
in january  we announced the initiation of the allovectin phase trial 
we entered into a research and development agreement with anges whereby anges agreed to fund our allovectin phase trial 
the funding will consist of purchases by anges of up to million of restricted shares of our common stock and additional non refundable cash payments by anges of up to million 
if the project costs exceed the aggregate amount of million  we and anges have agreed to share the excess project costs up to certain limits 
all of the funding provided by anges  including those funds used to purchase our common stock  must be used for actual and documented costs related to the allovectin phase trial 
in the event that the phase trial is successful  we will be responsible for funding the cost associated with obtaining a bla 
in addition  we are in the early stages of clinical development of an anthrax vaccine candidate  however  due to the lack of additional government funding  we do not intend to pursue further development of our anthrax vaccine candidate at this time except for the ongoing non clinical development supported by an sbir grant 
as a result  we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years  due primarily to the expansion of our research and development programs  the cost of preclinical studies and clinical trials  spending for outside services  costs related to maintaining our intellectual property portfolio  costs due to increased contract manufacturing activities  increased costs of our facilities  and possible advancement toward commercialization activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical information and assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and circumstances that may impact us in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
our critical accounting policies regarding revenue recognition are in the following areas license and royalty agreements  manufacturing contracts  and grant revenues 
our critical accounting policies also include recognition of expenses in research and development expenses and the valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition and emerging issues task force no 
 or eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
contract manufacturing revenue 
our contract manufacturing arrangements typically require the delivery of multiple lots of clinical vaccines 
in accordance with eitf  we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting 
the evaluation is performed at the inception of the arrangement 
the delivered item s is considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met a the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if the delivered item does not have standalone value or if we do not have objective or reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered component  the amount of revenue allocable to the delivered item is deferred 

table of contents license and royalty revenue 
our license and royalty revenues are generated through agreements with strategic partners 
nonrefundable  up front license fees and milestone payments with standalone value that are not dependent on any future performance by us under the arrangements are recognized as revenue upon the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured  but are deferred if we have continuing performance obligations 
if we have continuing involvement through contractual obligations under such agreement  such up front fees are deferred and recognized over the period for which we continue to have a performance obligation  unless all of the following criteria exist the delivered item s have standalone value to the customer  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and delivery or performance is probable and within our control for any items that have a right of return 
we recognize royalty revenues from licensed products when earned in accordance with the terms of the license agreements 
net sales figures used for calculating royalties include deductions for costs of returns  cash discounts  and freight and warehousing  which may vary over the course of the license agreement 
payments received related to milestones are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying agreements  which represent the culmination of the earnings process 
government research grant revenue 
we recognize revenues from federal government research grants during the period in which the related expenditures are incurred 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead expenses  clinical trials  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred 
we assess our obligations to make milestone payments that may become due under licensed or acquired technology to determine whether the payments should be expensed or capitalized 
we charge milestone payments to research and development expense when the technology is in the early stage of development and has no alternative uses  there is substantial uncertainty of the technology or product being successful  there will be difficulty in completing the remaining development  and there is substantial cost to complete the work 
capitalization and valuation of long lived and intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives consist of capitalized legal costs incurred in connection with patents  patent applications pending and technology license agreements 
payments to acquire a license to use a proprietary technology are capitalized if the technology is expected to have alternative future use in multiple research and development projects 
we amortize costs of approved patents  patent applications pending and license agreements over their estimated useful lives  or terms of the agreements  whichever are shorter 
for patents pending  we amortize the costs over the shorter of a period of twenty years from the date of filing the application or  if licensed  the term of the license agreement 
we re assess the useful lives of patents when they are issued  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the useful lives may have changed 
for patents and patent applications pending that we abandon  we charge the remaining unamortized accumulated costs to expense 

table of contents intangible assets and long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the review indicates that intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable  their carrying amount would be reduced to fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  and or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of december   our largest group of intangible assets with finite lives includes patents and patents pending for our dna delivery technology  consisting of intangible assets with a net carrying value of approximately million

change in accounting method for share based compensation as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  as discussed in note of the notes to financial statements included in this report  our loss from operations and net loss for the year ended december   was million  or per share higher than it would have been if our previous accounting method for share based compensation was applied during that year 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in revenues from our contracts and grants were million in as compared to million in the increase in contract and grant revenue was due primarily to a million increase in manufacturing contract shipments to the vrc under our nih agreement  which was partially offset by decreases in grant revenue and contract shipments to the us navy 
license and royalty revenues were million in as compared to million in in  we recognized million in license and milestone revenues related to merck s use of our technology for the development of specific cancer targets 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily a result of increased clinical trial expenses as a result of preparations for our allovectin phase trial  initiation of our phase cmv trial and increased stock compensation expense related to the implementation of sfas no 
r 
manufacturing and production expenses 
manufacturing and production expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase was primarily the result of the recognition of contract manufacturing costs associated with the shipment of clinical lots of dna vaccines to the vrc during the current period 
this increase was offset by a decrease in facility related costs in the current period as a result of the shutdown of one of our facilities in the prior period and a decrease in the use of scientific supplies used in the manufacturing process 
the primary focus of manufacturing and production during the year ended december   was the production of plasmids for programs under clinical development and the fulfillment of commitments under manufacturing contracts 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily the result of increased stock compensation expense related to the implementation of sfas no 
r and increased consulting and legal fees related to general business matters 
investment income 
investment income was million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances and higher rates of return in interest expense 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in the decrease was the result of lower principal amounts outstanding on our equipment financing obligations 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in revenues from our contracts and grants were million in as compared to million in the decrease in contract and grant revenue was due primarily to decreased manufacturing contract shipments to the vrc under our nih agreement  which was partially offset by increases in contract shipments to the us navy and in other grants 
license and royalty revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase in was primarily due to the recognition of million in license and milestone revenues related to merck s use of our technology for the development of specific cancer targets 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily a result of the million decrease in royalty expenses  including those related to the warf litigation settlement  and million in lower facility expenses 
manufacturing and production expenses 
manufacturing and production expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with our expanded manufacturing capabilities  which were not fully functional until the primary focus of manufacturing and production during the year ended december   was the production of plasmids for programs under clinical development and the fulfillment of commitments under manufacturing contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in professional fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  legal fees associated with the warf litigation and lower severance costs of million which were recorded in the prior year 
investment income 
investment income was million in as compared to million in investment income in included a million gain on the sale of corautus shares  which is partially offset by higher rates of return in interest expense 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in the decrease was the result of lower interest rates and lower principal amounts outstanding on our equipment financing obligations 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred and common stock  public offerings of common stock  and revenues from collaborative agreements 
from our inception through december   we have received approximately million in revenues from performing services under research and development contracts  grants  and manufacturing contracts  and from licensing access to our proprietary technologies  and we have raised net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately 
table of contents million  compared with million at december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including restricted securities  totaled approximately million at december   compared with million at december  the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for the year ended december   was due primarily to the sale of approximately million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million  which was offset by cash used to fund our operations and to pay our long term debt obligations 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the prior year  was primarily the result of a decrease in our net loss excluding higher non cash compensation expenses 
in addition  we experienced increased cash flows from the timing of cash receipts and payments related to receivables and trade payables 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the prior year  was primarily the result of an increase in net purchases of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the prior year  was primarily the result of an increase in the net proceeds received from our registered direct offerings of common stock and the purchase of restricted common stock by our partner anges 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses  manufacturing and production expenses  and general and administrative expenses  including continued increases in personnel costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical testing  outside services  facilities  intellectual property and possible commercialization costs 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  the impact of competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and possible commercialization activities and arrangements 
we may seek additional funding through research and development relationships with suitable potential corporate collaborators 
we may also seek additional funding through public or private financings 
we have on file two effective shelf registration statements that in the aggregate allow us to raise up to an additional million from the sale of common or preferred stock 
however  additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if additional funding is not available  we anticipate that our available cash and existing sources of funding will be adequate to satisfy our cash needs through at least december  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table sets forth our contractual obligations  including all off balance sheet arrangements  as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations equipment financing obligations unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents certain long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet are not presented in this table because they are already reflected in operating lease commitments  or do not require cash settlement in the future 
unconditional purchase obligations represent contractual commitments entered into for goods and services in the normal of course of our business 
the purchase obligations do not include potential severance payment obligations to our executive officers 
for information regarding these severance arrangements  refer to the final paragraph in this item in december  we modified an equipment financing agreement which provided for million of financing  with interest rates ranging from to 
a portion of the financing was used to repay outstanding debt of approximately million under another credit facility 
additional amounts were used to finance equipment purchases 
the draw down period for this equipment financing arrangement ended in october the agreement requires a non interest bearing cash security deposit in the amount of of the amount of each drawdown which amounts are included in current and long term other assets 
this financing involves restrictive financial covenants  including a requirement that we maintain unrestricted cash and marketable securities of at least million or obtain a letter of credit from another lender in the amount of outstanding borrowings 
if we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations to deliver the dna vaccines ordered by the vrc in the manner required by our manufacturing agreements with the vrc  the applicable federal acquisition regulations allow the vrc to cancel the agreements in whole or in part  and we may be required to perform corrective actions  including but not limited to remanufacturing vaccines or components thereof at the our expense  delivering to the vrc any uncompleted or partially completed work and or any government property in its possession  and or paying a third party supplier selected by the vrc to complete any uncompleted work 
for example  we have twice been obligated to remanufacture at our expense a component of a vaccine under our subcontract agreement with the vrc 
the subcontractor is currently evaluating the latest remanufactured vaccine component 
we believe that this latest vaccine component meets the specifications under the terms of the contract 
the performance of any future corrective actions could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the period or periods affected 
under the merck  sanofi aventis  anges  merial and aqua health agreements  we are required to pay up to of certain initial upfront monetary payments  and a small percentage of some royalty payments  to the warf 
the cytrx  bioject  inovio  university of michigan and university of massachusetts license agreements require us to make payments if we or our sublicensees advance products through clinical development 
for programs developed with the support of us government funding  the us government may have rights to resulting products without payment of royalties 
in addition  we have undertaken certain commitments under license agreements with collaborators  and under indemnification agreements with our officers and directors 
under the license agreements with our collaborators  we have agreed to continue to maintain and defend the patent rights licensed to the collaborators 
under the indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  we have agreed to indemnify those individuals for any expenses and liabilities in the event of a threatened  pending or actual investigation  lawsuit  or criminal or investigative proceeding 
as of december   we have employment agreements that contain severance arrangements with each of our three executive officers and three of our other executives 
under these agreements  we are obligated to pay severance if we terminate such an executive officer s or other executive s employment without cause  or if such an executive officer or other executive resigns for good reason  as defined in the agreements  within the periods set forth therein 
the severance would consist of continued payments at the current base compensation rate  or current base compensation rate plus the prior year s cash bonus in the case of the ceo  for the period specified in each agreement  which ranges from six to twelve months 
these agreements also specify that any earnings from employment or consulting during this period will offset any salary continuation payments due from us 
the maximum payments due under these employment agreements would have been million if each such executive officer and other executive was terminated at december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
our investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents  both restricted and non restricted  and marketable securities 
the average maturity of our non equity investments is approximately nine months 
our investments are classified as available for sale securities 
to assess our interest rate risk  we performed a sensitivity analysis projecting an ending fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities using the following assumptions a month time horizon  a month average maturity and a basis point increase in interest rates 
this pro forma fair value would have been million lower than the reported fair value of our non equity investments at december  at december   our unrealized gain on marketable securities was million
