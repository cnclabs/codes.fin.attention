item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary our business 
we operate outpatient physical and or occupational therapy clinics that provide preventative and post operative care for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries  treatment for neurologically related injuries and rehabilitation of injured workers 
at december   we operated outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics in states 
the average age of our clinics at december   was years 
we have developed of the clinics and acquired to date  we have sold seven clinics  closed facilities due to substandard performance  and consolidated four clinics with other existing clinics 
in  we added new clinics including developed and eight acquired  closed and sold one 

table of contents in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with four third party facilities under management as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized in the period in which services are rendered 
net patient revenues patient revenues less estimated contractual adjustments are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from insurance companies  third party payors  patients and others for services rendered 
the company has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to the company at contracted amounts different from its established rates 
the allowance for estimated contractual adjustments is based on terms of payor contracts and historical collection and write off experience 
contractual allowances 
contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and expected reimbursements by both insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs for such services 
medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services provided in our clinics 
we estimate contractual allowances based on our interpretation of the applicable regulations  payor contracts and historical calculations 
each month the company estimates its contractual allowance for each clinic based on payor contracts and the historical collection experience of the clinic and applies an appropriate contractual allowance reserve percentage to the gross accounts receivable balances for each payor of the clinic 
based on our historical experience  calculating the contractual allowance reserve percentage at the payor level is sufficient to allow us to provide the necessary detail and accuracy with our collectibility estimates 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
payor terms are periodically revised necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimates made by management 
our billing system does not capture the exact change in our contractual allowance reserve estimate from period to period 
therefore  in order to assess the accuracy of our revenues and hence our contractual allowance reserves  our management regularly compares its cash collections to corresponding net revenues measured both in the aggregate and on a clinic by clinic basis 
in the aggregate  the historical difference between net revenues and corresponding cash collections has generally been less than of net revenues 
additionally  analysis of subsequent period s contractual write offs on a payor basis shows a less than difference between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage as compared to the estimated contractual allowance reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance 
as a result  we believe that a reasonable likely change in the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not likely be more than at december  for purposes of demonstrating the sensitivity of this estimate on the company s financial condition  a one percent increase or decrease in our aggregate contractual allowance reserve percentage would decrease or increase  respectively  net patient revenue by approximately  for the year ended december  management believes the changes in the estimate of the contractual allowance reserve for the periods ended december   and have not been material to the statement of operations 
the following table sets forth information regarding our accounts receivable as of the dates indicated in thousands december  gross accounts receivable less contractual allowances subtotal accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts net patient accounts receivable 
table of contents the following table presents our accounts receivable aging by payor class as of the dates indicated in thousands december  december  current to current to payor days days total days days total managed care commercial plans medicare medicaid workers compensation self pay other totals workers compensation is paid by state administrators or their designated agents 
other includes primarily litigation claims and  to a lesser extent  vehicular insurance claims 
historically  of balances are reclassified into self pay from other categories primarily managed care  medicare and other after all expected payments are received from third party payors 
reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
for a more complete description of our third party revenue sources  see business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each clinic 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experience with particular payors to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have a large number of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus  require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our aggregate allowance for doubtful accounts is regularly reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our federal and state income tax liability  as well as assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as bad debt expense and amortization of leasehold improvements for tax and for accounting purposes 
the differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we periodically assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and if not  establish a valuation allowance 
carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
we account for our long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
this accounting standard requires that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment or intangible assets exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 
also  if the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value  we are required to allocate the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  as if we had just acquired it in a business combination 
we then write down the carrying value of our goodwill to the implied fair value 
any such write down is included as an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of net income 
judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long lived assets 
we may use quoted market prices  prices for similar assets  present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates 
in addition  we may obtain independent appraisals in certain circumstances 
we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to apply these valuation techniques 
irrespective of our valuation analysis  future market conditions may deteriorate 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
in  no goodwill was written off due to impairment based upon our annual

this amount will be paid during the company makes reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect its accounts receivable  including applicable deductible and co payment amounts  in a consistent manner for all payor types 
claims are submitted to payors daily  weekly or monthly in accordance with our policy or payor s requirements 
when possible  we submit our claims electronically 
the collection process is time consuming and typically involves the submission of claims to multiple payors whose payment of claims may be dependent upon the payment of another payor 
claims under litigation and vehicular incidents can take a year or longer to collect 
medicare and other payor claims relating to new clinics awaiting medicare rehab agency status approval initially may not be submitted for six to months

we have future obligations for debt repayments  employment agreements and future minimum rentals under operating leases 
the obligations as of december  are summarized as follows in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter notes payable employee agreements operating leases historically  we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and to cover operational needs 
we generally develop new clinics rather than acquire them  which requires less capital 
we plan to continue developing new clinics and make additional acquisitions in select markets 
we have from time to time purchased the minority interests of limited partners in our clinic partnerships 
we may purchase additional minority interests in the future 
generally  any acquisition or purchase of minority interests is expected to be accomplished using a combination of cash and notes 
we believe that existing funds and the availability of funds under the credit agreement  supplemented by cash flows from existing operations  will be sufficient to meet our current operating needs  new clinic development plans and any purchases of minority interests through at least december any large acquisition would probably be financed with debt

operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be lower than more seasoned clinics because of start up costs and lower patient visits and revenues 
generally  patient visits and revenues gradually increase in the first year of operation  as patients and referral sources become aware of the new clinic 
revenues tend to increase significantly during the two to three years following the first anniversary of a clinic opening
