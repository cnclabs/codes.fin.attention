table of contents as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  funds from operations  or ffo  represents net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  excluding gains from sales of property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company adjusts the nareit definition to add back minority interests expense 
the company presents ffo because the company considers it an important supplemental measure of the company s operational performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including the company s ability to pay dividends or make distributions

overview the company is a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit that invests in specialty office buildings for the medical profession  including medical offices  ambulatory surgery and diagnostic centers  in the united states of america 
the company has been built around understanding and addressing the specialized real estate needs of the healthcare industry 
the company s management team has developed long term and extensive relationships through developing and maintaining modern  customized medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities 
the company has been able to maintain occupancy above market levels and secure strategic hospital campus locations 
the company operates its business through cogdell spencer lp  its operating partnership subsidiary  and its subsidiaries 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases in medical office buildings and other healthcare related facilities 
the company derives a lesser portion of its revenues from fees that are paid for managing and developing medical office buildings and other healthcare related facilities for third parties 
the company s management believes a strong internal property management capability is a vital component of the company s business  both for the properties the company owns and for those that the company manages 
as of december   the company owned and or managed medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities  serving hospital systems in ten states 
the company s aggregate portfolio was comprised of wholly owned properties  four joint venture properties  and properties owned by third parties at december   the company s aggregate portfolio contains approximately million net rentable square feet  consisting of approximately million net rentable square feet from wholly owned properties  approximately million net rentable square feet from joint venture properties  and approximately million net rental square feet from properties owned by third parties and managed by the company 
approximately of the net rentable square feet of the wholly owned properties are situated on hospital campuses 
as such  the company believes that its assets occupy a premier franchise location in relation to local hospitals  providing the company s properties with a distinct competitive advantage over alternative medical office space in an area 
as of december   the company s wholly owned properties were approximately occupied  with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately years 
factors which may influence future results of operations generally  the company s revenues and expenses have remained consistent except for development fees and changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements reflected in interest expense 
development fees from wholly owned and consolidated joint venture projects are eliminated in consolidation and will continue to vary to the extent there are fees from third party projects 
related to the company s interest rate swap agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting  changes in fair values  which vary from period to period based on changes in market interest rates  are recorded in interest 
table of contents expense 
generally  increases decreases in market interest rates will increase decrease the fair value of the derivative  which will decrease increase current period interest expense for the change in fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  the company terminated several derivative transactions and entered into new agreements with the appropriate hedge documentation in place  which will reduce the variances previously experienced in interest expense 
the company will continue to have interest expense variability for variable rate mortgages that do not have interest rate swap agreements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements and the company s predecessor s combined financial statements  which have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with gaap 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation and combination 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
the company s actual results may differ from these estimates 
management has provided a summary of the company s significant accounting policies in note to the company s consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies are those judged to involve accounting estimates or assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters or susceptibility of such matters to change 
other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of the company s results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
investments in real estate acquisition of real estate 
the price that the company pays to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors 
accordingly  the company is required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the company s estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to the company 
each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
the company s calculation methodology is summarized in note to the company s audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on the company s results of operations because if the company were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if the company were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of value or negative value assigned to above or below market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in the company s consolidated and combined statements of operations 
useful lives of assets 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the company s properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the company s investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income loss because if the company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the company s investments in real estate the company would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense on an annual basis 

table of contents asset impairment valuation 
the company reviews the carrying value of its properties when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate a potential impairment may exist 
the company bases its review on an estimate of the future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
the company considers factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if the company s evaluation indicates that it may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
these losses have a direct impact on the company s net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to operating results 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  the company s strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if the company s strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if the company determines that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
the company estimates the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 
the company reviews the value of goodwill using an income approach on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist 
revenue recognition rental income related to non cancelable operating leases is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases  which is the period from occupancy to lease termination date 
deferred rents included in the company s consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the rental revenue that would be recognized under the cash flow received  based on the terms of the leases 
at times the company will receive cash payments at the inception of the lease for tenant improvements and these amounts are amortized into rental revenue over the life of the lease 
the company s leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for all property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by the company 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled and the company has no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
as discussed above  the company recognizes amortization of the value of acquired above or below market tenant leases as a reduction of rental income in the case of above market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below market leases 
the company receives fees for property management and development and consulting services from time to time from third parties which is reflected as fee revenue 
management fees are generally based on a percentage of revenues for the month as defined in the related property management agreements 
development and consulting fees are recorded on a percentage of completion method using management s best estimate of time and costs to complete projects 
the company has a long history of developing reasonable and dependable estimates related to development or consulting contracts with clear requirements and rights of the parties to the contracts 
although not frequent  occasionally revisions to estimates of costs are necessary and are reflected as a change in estimate when known 
due to the amount of control retained by the company  most joint venture developments will be consolidated  therefore those development fees will be eliminated in consolidation 
other income shown in the statement of operations  generally includes interest income  primarily from the amortization of unearned income on a sales type capital lease recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and other income incidental to the company s operations and is recognized when earned 
the company must make subjective estimates as to when the company s revenue is earned and the collectibility of the company s accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income 
table of contents because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
reit qualification requirements the company is subject to a number of operational and organizational requirements to qualify and then maintain qualification as a reit 
if the company does not qualify as a reit  its income would become subject to us federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates that would be substantial and the company cannot re elect to qualify as a reit for five years 
the resulting adverse effects on the company s results of operations  liquidity and amounts distributable to stockholders would be material 
results of operations the discussion below relates to the financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december    and the results of operations for january  through october  and november  through december  have been combined to provide a meaningful comparison to the results of operations for the year ended december  the company s income loss from operations is generated primarily from operations of its properties and development and property management fee revenue 
the changes in operating results from period to period reflect changes in existing property performance and changes in the number of properties due to development  acquisition  or disposition of properties

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million available in cash and cash equivalents 
the company is required to distribute at least of the company s net taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to the company s stockholders on an annual basis due to qualification requirements as a reit 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that the company will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet the company s liquidity needs 
instead  these needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 
as a result of the offering and the formation transactions  the company s debt and liquidity changed significantly 
the company believes that the offering and the formation transactions improves the capital structure and financial flexibility of its business compared to its predecessor s structure 
the company also expects to access additional funds through secured and unsecured borrowings 
on november   the company  as guarantor  and the operating partnership entered into our million credit facility  with a syndicate of financial institutions including bank of america  na  citicorp north america  inc and branch banking trust company collectively  the lenders  with bank of america  na  as the administrative agent for the lenders  and banc of america securities llc and citigroup global markets inc  as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers 
the credit facility shall be available to fund working capital and other corporate purposes  finance acquisition and development activity  and refinance existing and future indebtedness 
in august  the credit facility capacity was increased from million to million 
the credit facility permits the operating partnership to borrow up to million of revolving loans  with sub limits of million for swingline loans and million for letters of credit 
the credit facility shall terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder shall be due and payable in full  three years from november   subject to a one year extension at the company s option 
the credit facility also allows for up to million of increased availability to a total aggregate available amount of million  at the company s option but subject to each lender s option to increase its commitment 
the interest rate on loans under the credit facility equals  at the company s election  either libor plus a margin of between to basis points based on the company s leverage ratio or the higher of the federal funds rate plus basis points or bank of america  na s prime rate 
the credit facility contains customary terms and conditions for credit facilities of this type  including limitations on the company s ability to a incur additional indebtedness  b make distributions to the company s stockholders  subject to complying with reit requirements  and c make certain investments  maintenance of a pool of unencumbered assets subject to certain minimum valuations thereof  and requirements for the company to maintain certain financial coverage ratios 
these customary financial coverage ratios and other conditions include a maximum leverage ratio  with flexibility for one two quarter increase to not more than  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum combined secured indebtedness  maximum recourse indebtedness  maximum unsecured indebtedness  with flexibility for one two quarter increase to not more than  minimum unencumbered interest coverage ratio  with the flexibility for one two quarter decrease to and minimum combined tangible net worth million plus of net proceeds of equity issuances by the company and its subsidiaries after november  
as of december   there was million available under the credit facility 
there is million outstanding at december  and million of availability is restricted related to outstanding letters of credit 
certain of the company s mortgage notes payable and the company s credit facility require that the company comply with certain affirmative  negative and financial covenants 
the company was in compliance with the covenants as of december  for mortgages with maturities during  the company expects to refinance these mortgages 
for purchase commitments related to development projects  the company expects to fund these projects either from the credit facility or from construction notes payable 

table of contents management believes that the company will have sufficient capital resources as a result of operations and the borrowings in place and availability under the credit facility to fund ongoing operations 
long term liquidity needs the company s principal long term liquidity needs consist primarily of new property development  property acquisitions  principal payments under various mortgages and other credit facilities and non recurring capital expenditures 
the company does not expect that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet all of these long term liquidity needs 
instead  the company expects to finance new property developments through modest cash equity capital contributed by the company together with construction loan proceeds  as well as through cash equity investments by its tenants 
the company expects to fund property acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under its credit facility and traditional secured mortgage financing 
in addition  the company expects to use op units issued by the operating partnership to acquire properties from existing owners seeking a tax deferred transaction 
the company expects to meet other long term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and through additional equity and debt financings  including loans from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  bridge loans  letters of credit  and other lending arrangements  most of which will be secured by mortgages 
the company may also issue unsecured debt in the future 
however  in view of the company s strategy to grow its portfolio over time  the company does not  in general  expect to meet its long term liquidity needs through sales of its properties 
in the event that  notwithstanding this intent  the company was in the future to consider sales of its properties from time to time  the proceeds that would be available to the company from such sales  may be reduced by amounts that the company may owe under the tax protection agreements entered into in connection with the formation transactions or those properties would need to be sold in a tax deferred transaction which would require reinvestment of the proceeds in another property 
in addition  the company s ability to sell certain of its assets could be adversely affected by the general illiquidity of real estate assets and certain additional factors particular to the company s portfolio such as the specialized nature of its target property type  property use restrictions and the need to obtain consents or waivers of rights of first refusal or rights of first offers from ground lessors in the case of sales of its properties that are subject to ground leases 
the company intends to repay indebtedness incurred under its credit facility from time to time  for acquisitions or otherwise  out of cash flow and from the proceeds of additional debt or equity issuances 
in the future  the company may seek to increase the amount of the credit facility  negotiate additional credit facilities or issue corporate debt instruments 
any indebtedness incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  short  medium or long term  fixed or variable interest rate and may be subject to other terms and conditions the company deems acceptable 
the company intends to refinance at maturity the mortgage notes payable that have balloon payments at maturity 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december   including the maturities and scheduled principal repayments and the commitments due in connection with the company s ground leases and operating leases for the periods indicated in thousands thereafter total obligation long term debt principal payments and maturities standby letters of credit interest payments purchase commitments ground leases operating leases total

these purchase commitments are related to the company s development projects that are currently under construction 
substantially all of the ground leases effectively limit the company s control over various aspects of the operation of the applicable property  restrict the company s ability to transfer the property and allow the lessor the right of first refusal to purchase the building and improvements 
all of the ground leases provide for the property to revert to the lessor for no consideration upon the expiration or earlier termination of the ground lease 
payments under operating lease agreements relate to several of our properties equipment leases 
the future minimum lease commitments under these leases are as indicated above 
off balance sheet arrangements the company guarantees debt in connection with certain of its development activities  including joint ventures 
the company has guaranteed  in the event of a default  the mortgage note payable for one unconsolidated real estate joint venture 
an initial liability of million has been recorded for the guarantee using expected present value measurement techniques 
the guarantee  which has a principal balance of million at december   will be released upon the full repayment of the mortgage note payable  which matures in december the mortgage is collateralized by property and the collateral will revert to the guarantor in the event the guarantee is performed 
management believes the probability the company will have to perform on the guarantee in the future is minimal and therefore the company does not expect the company s guarantee to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
real estate taxes the company s leases generally require the tenants to be responsible for all real estate taxes 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on the results of operations for the periods shown in the consolidated and combined financial statements 
although the impact of inflation has been relatively insignificant in recent years  it remains a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost of acquiring or replacing properties 
seasonality the company does not consider its business to be subject to material seasonality fluctuations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company uses some derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to the company s borrowings 
the company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enters into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december   the company had approximately million of consolidated debt outstanding 
approximately million  or  of the company s total consolidated debt was variable rate debt that are not subject to variable to fixed rate interest rate swap agreements 
approximately million  or  of the company s total indebtedness was subject to fixed interest rates  including variable rate debt that is subject to variable to fixed rate swap agreements 
if libor were to increase by basis points  the increase in interest expense on the company s variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  the company may take actions to further mitigate the company s exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in the company s financial structure
