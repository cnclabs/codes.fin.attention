item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general since its incorporation in  camco has evolved into a full service provider of financial products to the communities served by advantage 
utilizing a common marketing theme based on camco s commitment to personalized customer service  camco and its affiliates have grown from million of consolidated assets in to billion of consolidated assets at december  camco s rate of growth is largely attributable to its acquisitions and its continued expansion of product lines from the limited deposit and loan offerings which the bank could offer in the heavily regulated environment of the s to the wider array of financial service products that commercial banks traditionally offer 
additionally  camco has enhanced its operational growth  to a lesser extent  by chartering a title insurance agency 
management believes that continued success in the financial services industry will be achieved by those institutions with a rigorous dedication to building value added customer oriented organizations 
toward this end  each of the bank s divisions has the ability to make local decisions for customer contacts and services  however back office operations are consolidated and centralized 
based on consumer preferences  the bank s management designs financial service products with a view towards differentiating each of the constituent divisions from its competition 
management believes that the bank divisions ability to rapidly adapt to consumer needs and preferences is essential to them as community based financial institutions competing against the larger regional and money center bank holding companies 
camco s profitability depends primarily on its level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings 
in recent years  camco s operations have also been heavily influenced by its level of other income  including mortgage banking income and other fee income 
camco s operations are also affected by general  administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  data processing  franchise taxes  advertising  other operating expenses and federal income tax expense 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
when used herein  the terms anticipates  plans  expects  believes  and similar expressions as they relate to camco or its management are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
camco s actual results  performance or achievements may materially differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such material differences include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  interest rate environment  competitive conditions in the financial services industry  changes in law  governmental policies and regulations  and rapidly changing technology affecting financial services 
non gaap financial measures this report includes one or more non gaap financial measures within the meaning of regulation g 
with respect to each  camco has disclosed the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and reconciled the differences between the non gaap financial measure and the most comparable financial measure presented in accordance with gaap 
camco believes that the presentation of the non gaap financial measures in this report assist management and investors to compare results period to period in a more meaningful and consistent manner and provide a better measure of results for camco s ongoing operations 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this annual report  are based upon camco s consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires camco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under us gaap 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and goodwill impairment 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses the procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses reflect our evaluation of credit risk after careful consideration of all information available to us 
in developing this assessment  we must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries and issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is regularly reviewed by management to determine whether the amount is considered adequate to absorb probable losses 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan pools that are based on historical loss experience  and general loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions 
also considered as part of that judgment is a review of the bank s trends in delinquencies and loan losses  as well as trends in delinquencies and losses for the region and nationally  and economic factors 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
while management strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
mortgage servicing rights to determine the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights msrs each reporting quarter  advantage transmits information to a third party provider  representing individual loan information in each pooling period accompanied by escrow amounts 
the third party then evaluates the possible impairment of msrs as described below 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
a pooling methodology to the servicing valuation  in which loans with similar characteristics are pooled together  is applied for valuation purposes 
once pooled  each grouping of loans is evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that a purchaser could expect to realize from the portfolio 
earnings are projected from a variety of sources including loan service fees  interest earned on float  net interest earned on escrow balances  miscellaneous income and costs to service the loans 
the present value of future earnings is the estimated market value for the pool  calculated using consensus assumptions that a third party purchaser would utilize in evaluating a potential acquisition of the servicing 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the interest rate for float  which is supplied by management  takes into consideration the investment portfolio average yield as well as current short duration investment yields 
management believes this methodology provides a reasonable estimate 
mortgage loan prepayment speeds are calculated by the third party provider utilizing the economic outlook as published by the office of chief economist of freddie mac in estimating prepayment speeds and provides a specific scenario with each evaluation 
based on the assumptions discussed  pre tax projections are prepared for each pool of loans serviced 
these earning figures approximate the cash flow that could be received from the servicing portfolio 
valuation results are presented quarterly to management 
at that time  management reviews the information and mortgage servicing rights are marked to lower of amortized cost or market for the current quarter 
goodwill we have developed procedures to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis using june financial information 
this testing procedure is outsourced to a third party that evaluates possible impairment based on the following the test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities  identified intangible assets and goodwill to a reporting unit and comparing the fair value of this reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
the value is determined assuming a freely negotiated transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller  neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts 
accordingly  to derive the fair value of the reporting unit  the following common approaches to valuing business combination transactions involving financial institutions are utilized by a third party selected by camco the comparable transactions approach specifically based on earnings  book  assets and deposit premium multiples received in recent sales of comparable thrift franchises  and the discounted cash flow approach 
the application of these valuation techniques takes into account the reporting unit s operating history  the current market environment and future prospects 
as of the most recent quarter  the only reporting unit carrying goodwill is the bank 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and no second step is required 
if not  a second test is required to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
the second test of the overall goodwill impairment compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the impairment loss shall equal the excess of carrying value over fair value 
after each testing period  the third party compiles a summary of the test that is then provided to the audit committee for review 
as of the most recent testing date  june   the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
summary management believes the accounting estimates related to the allowance for loan losses  the capitalization  amortization  and valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the goodwill impairment test are critical accounting estimates because the estimates are highly susceptible to change from period to period because they require management to make assumptions concerning the changes in the types and volumes of the portfolios  rates of future prepayments  and anticipated economic conditions  and the impact of recognizing an impairment or loan loss could have a material effect on camco s assets reported on the balance sheet as well as its net earnings 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed camco s disclosures relating to such matters in the quarterly management s discussion and analysis 
discussion of financial condition changes from december  to december  at december   camco s consolidated assets totaled billion  a decrease of million  or  from the december  total 
the decrease in total assets was comprised primarily of decreases in loans receivable coupled with decreases in cash and cash equivalents and mortgage backed securities available for sale  offset partially by the increase of investments securities available for sale 
cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
investment securities totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from the total at december  investments securities purchases totaled million  while principal repayments totaled million 
purchases were comprised primarily of intermediate term callable us government sponsored enterprises with an average yield of 
investments available for sale were purchased during the year to provide collateral for public deposits and to replace maturing securities 
mortgage backed securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  mortgage backed securities purchases totaled million  while principal repayments totaled million during the year ended december  purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year were comprised primarily of pass through mortgage backed securities yielding issued by fannie mae 
all of the securities purchased were classified as available for sale 
loans receivable and loans held for sale totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the total at december  the decrease resulted primarily from repayments of million and loan sales of million  partially offset by loan disbursements and purchases totaling million 
loan origination volume  including purchases of loans  was less than that of the comparable period by million  or  while the volume of loan sales decreased by million year to year 
the number of loans originated for sale in the secondary market continues to decline as long term rates have risen and the economy slows 
rising interest rates generally result in an increase in the production of adjustable rate loans for the portfolio 
instead of selling adjustable rate loans  camco has typically held adjustable rate mortgage loans in its portfolio as an integral part of its strategy to build interest rate sensitive assets for interest rate risk purposes 
loan originations during the month period were comprised primarily of million of loans secured by one to four family residential real estate  million in consumer and other loans and million in loans secured by commercial real estate 
management intends to continue to expand its consumer and commercial real estate lending in future periods as a means of increasing the yield on its loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of nonperforming loans at those dates 
nonperforming loans three months or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  constituting and of total net loans  including loans held for sale  at those dates 
at december   nonperforming loans were comprised of million of loans secured by one to four family residential real estate  million of loans secured by multi family  nonresidential real estate and commercial loans and  of consumer and other loans 
although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  which could adversely affect camco s results of operations 
deposits totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from december  levels 
the increase resulted from increases of million in certificates of deposit and million in money market accounts which were partially offset by decreases of million in interest bearing checking accounts and million in savings accounts 
the increase in certificates of deposit is a result of the bank actively pursuing the extension of deposit maturities in a rising rate environment  coupled with the offering of brokered certificates of deposit  which are a lower cost alternative to advances from the fhlb 
the decreases in interest bearing checking accounts and savings accounts were due to highly competitive pricing in the bank s market area and customer demand for higher yielding certificates of deposit 
cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
investment securities totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from the total at december  investment securities purchases totaled million while proceeds from maturities totaled million

purchases were comprised primarily of intermediate term callable us government sponsored enterprises with an average yield of mortgage backed securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  mortgage backed securities purchases totaled million  while principal repayments totaled million during the year ended december  purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year were comprised primarily of pass through mortgage backed securities yielding issued by federal home loan mortgage corporation 
all of the securities purchased were classified as available for sale 
advances from the fhlb and other borrowings decreased by million  or  to a total of million at december  camco was able to reduce borrowings as a result of the issuance of million of brokered deposits and a net decrease in the loan portfolio of million 
a reduction in cash balances at december  of million reflects cash used to reduce fhlb borrowings 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   a  or  increase from december  the increase resulted primarily from net income of million  and a decrease in unrealized losses on securities of  which was partially offset by dividends of million and treasury buyback of stock of million 
the bank is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital pursuant to federal regulations 
at december   the regulatory capital of the bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
camco s net earnings for the year ended december   totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from the million of net income reported in the decrease in earnings was primarily due to the increase of million in general  administrative and other expenses coupled with the decrease of million in other income which was offset partially by a million  or  decrease in the provision for federal taxes 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  a decrease of  or  compared to  generally reflecting the effects of an increase of basis points in the cost of funds which was offset partially by a million decrease in the average balance of cost of funds and an increase of interest earning assets of basis points in the average yield  from in to in  and a  increase in the average balance of interest earning assets outstanding year to year 
interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the comparable total

interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  from the increase resulted primarily from a basis point increase in the average rate to in  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in the average balance outstanding year to year 
as a result of the foregoing changes in interest income and interest expense  net interest income decreased by  or  to a total of million for the year ended december  the interest rate spread decreased to approximately at december   from at december   while the net interest margin decreased to approximately for the year ended december   compared to for the period 
provision for losses on loans 
a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the bank  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the bank s market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of the bank s loan portfolio 
based upon an analysis of these factors  management recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from the provision recorded in other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to a  decrease in mortgage servicing rights  a  or  decrease in gain on sale of loans and a  or decrease in late charges  rent and other income 
the decrease in mortgage servicing rights was attributable to the increase of loan prepayments in the servicing portfolio for the period coupled with the decrease of loans sold 
the decrease in gain on sale of loans was due primarily to a decrease in the volume of loans sold of million  or  from the volume of loans sold in during  the bank recorded msr s on new loan sales totaling  and amortization of msr s totaling million  which resulted in net loss in revenue item of  the decrease in late charges  rent and other was due primarily to a management decision to discontinue the accrual of late charges on commercial loans and move to a method that would recognize late charges as income when collected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of the bank s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within the bank s policy limits 
this objective is accomplished through management of the bank s balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates and customer preferences 
the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand or unexpected deposit withdrawals 
this is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities  maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity and achieving consistent growth in core deposits 
management considers interest rate risk the bank s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of the bank s net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
to identify and manage its interest rate risk  the bank employs an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes management projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered by the bank 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
assumptions are inherently uncertain and the measurement of net interest income or the impact of rate fluctuations on net interest income cannot be precisely predicted 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the bank s board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the bank s current interest rate risk position is determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming an instantaneous and parallel shift linear increase or decrease in all interest rates 
the following table shows the bank s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in percentage change in interest rates net interest income basis points months these estimated changes in net interest income are within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
the alco also monitors the sensitivity of the bank s economic value of equity eve due to sudden and sustained changes in market rates 
the eve ratio  measured on a static basis at the current period end  is calculated by dividing the economic value of equity by the economic value of total assets 
the alco also monitors the change in eve on a percentage change basis 
the following table shows the eve ratios as of december  change in interest rates percentage basis points eve ratio change in eve in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  the bank has developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
generally  all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or federal national mortgage association fnma guidelines are sold for cash upon origination 
a total of million and million of such loans were sold to the fhlmc  fnma and other parties during and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources camco  like other financial institutions  is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain sufficient funds to meet deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
liquid assets consist of cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  investments and mortgage backed securities 
management monitors and assesses liquidity needs daily in order to meet deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
the following table sets forth information regarding the bank s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contract as of december  payments due by period less more than than year years years years total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations advances from the federal home loan bank repurchase agreements certificates of deposit ohio equity funds for housing amount of commitments expiration per period commitments to originate loans overdraft lines of credit home equity one to four family and multi family loans includes lip commercial includes lip loc non residential real estate and land loans total contractual obligations advantage anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
based upon historical deposit flow data  the bank s competitive pricing in its market and management s experience  management believes that a significant portion of maturing certificates of deposit will remain with the bank 
the bank engages in off balance sheet credit related activities that could require advantage to make cash payments in the event that specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts of these activities represent the maximum exposure to the bank as further described in note i commitments however  certain off balance sheet commitments are expected to expire or be only partially used  therefore  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these off balance sheet activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of the bank s customers 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of advantage s management strategy 
in the event that the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional funds are available through the use of fhlb advances  brokered deposits  and through the sales of loans and or securities 
ohio statutes impose certain limitations on the payment of dividends and other capital distributions by banks 
generally  absent approval of the superintendent of banks  such statutes limit dividend and capital distributions to earnings of the current and two preceding years
