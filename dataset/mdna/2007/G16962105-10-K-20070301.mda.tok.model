item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the effects of foreign currency exchange rates on our brazilian fertilizer segment results 
in  we began utilizing net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustments arising from remeasuring our investment in the assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses of our brazilian subsidiaries 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges  we record the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
during  we entered into cross currency swaps with a notional value of million to hedge our net investment in brazilian assets 
we pay brazilian reais and receive us dollars using fixed interest rates  offsetting the translation adjustment of our net investment in brazilian reais assets 
these swaps have maturity dates in and at december   the fair value of these currency swaps was a loss of million  of which million was recorded in other current liabilities  and million in other non current liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheet and the loss on the net investment hedge included in accumulated other comprehensive income was million 
these hedges are excluded in the determination of our exposure 
in addition  to minimize our risk from exchange fluctuations in connection with anticipated sales in foreign currencies  during the year ended december   zero cost collar contracts were purchased and designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow hedge derivatives that are highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction 
in most cases  amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be released to net income some time after the maturity of the related derivative 
results of hedges related to sales in foreign currencies are recorded in net sales 
as of december   approximately million of anticipated foreign currency denominated sales have been hedged with the underlying derivative contracts settling at various dates beginning in january through december at december   the fair value of contracts expected to settle within the next months  which is recorded in other current assets  approximated million 
the change in the fair value of the contracts designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and was approximately million  net of income taxes  as of december  the change in the fair value will be reclassified into earnings when the anticipated sales occur with approximately million  net of tax  expected to be released to earnings in the ineffective portion of these hedges was not material 
we assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow hedged items 
interest rate risk we issue debt in fixed and floating rate instruments 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
the following table summarizes our total short term and long term debt exposure to interest rate risk at december  variable rate debt fixed rate debt total us in millions a hypothetical basis point increase in the interest rates of our debt at december  would result in a decrease in the fair value of our debt of approximately million 
similarly  a decrease of basis points in the interest rates of our debt at december  would cause an increase in the fair value of our debt of approximately million 
in addition  a hypothetical change in the libor interest rates would result in a change in our interest expense of approximately million 
the calculation assumes that all long term debt maturing within one year is variable rate debt in addition to the debt that carries a variable interest rate 
some of our variable rate debt is denominated in currencies other than in us dollars and is indexed to non us dollar based interest rate indices  such as euribor and igpm 
as such  the hypothetical change in interest rate ignores the impact from any currency movements 
our commercial paper is rated a by standard poor s rating services and p by moody s investors service  inc and the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings are generally governed by these ratings 
interest rate derivatives we use various derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with outstanding or forecasted fixed and variable rate debt and debt issuances  including interest rate swaps  options  and futures as may be required 
we account for the interest rate swap agreements we enter into as fair value hedges 
the interest rate swaps used by us as derivative hedging instruments have been recorded at fair value in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded currently in earnings 
additionally  the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in interest rates 
ineffectiveness  as defined in sfas no 
 is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset 
the derivatives we entered into for hedge purposes are assumed to be perfectly effective under the shortcut method of sfas no 
the differential between the fixed and variable rates to be paid or received on changes in interest rates is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
the interest rate differential on the swaps settles in cash every six months until expiration 
in  we entered into various interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million maturing in for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure associated with million principal amount of senior notes due upon termination of these interest rate swap agreements in the year ended december   we recognized a settlement gain of approximately million 
this gain will be amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the senior notes due we have accounted for the interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
the following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges as of december  fair value loss maturity december  us in millions total receive fixed pay variable notional amount weighted average variable rate payable weighted average fixed rate receivable interest is payable in arrears based on six month libor plus a spread 
we recognized approximately million  as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income in the year ended december   relating to its outstanding interest rate swap agreements
