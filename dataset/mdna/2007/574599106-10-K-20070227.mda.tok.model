item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently believe to be immaterial  also may adversely impact our company 
should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events  these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following  which we consider to be most relevant to our specific business activities 
a significant portion of our business relies on residential construction activity 
our results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity  including repair  remodeling and new home construction  principally in north america and europe 
significant factors that impact demand for home improvement and residential construction include interest rates  energy costs  consumer confidence  general and regional economic conditions  weather conditions and natural disasters 
the ability of contractors and builders to supply construction projects and the timing of such projects  and thereby their purchases of our products and services  can be affected significantly by the availability of building materials and skilled labor 
demographic factors  such as changes in population growth and household formation  affect levels of home improvement and residential construction over the longer term 
we have increased our emphasis on new product development in recent years and we have reduced our prior focus on growth through acquisitions and are concentrating instead on organic growth 
consequently  our financial performance will  in part  reflect our success in implementing our growth strategies in our existing markets and in introducing new products or entering new geographic markets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under item of this report for discussion of the impact of residential construction activities on the company s operating results 
we rely on key customers 
the size and importance of individual customers has increased because customers in our major distribution channels have consolidated 
larger customers can effect significant changes in their volume 
table of contents of purchases and can otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which we do business 
these customers are increasing their purchases of products directly from manufacturers for sale as private label and house brand merchandise 
as some of our customers expand their markets and targeted customers  conflicts occur and in some instances we may also become their competitor 
sales of our home improvement and building products to home center retailers are substantial 
in  sales to the company s largest customer  the home depot  were billion approximately percent of net sales 
although builders  dealers and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the company s products  the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot would have a material adverse impact on the company 
we face significant competition in the us and global markets 
the major markets for our products and services are highly competitive and in recent years global competition has increased significantly 
competition in home improvement and building product lines is based largely on performance  quality  brand reputation  style  delivery  customer service  exclusivity and price 
competition in the markets for our service businesses is based primarily on price  customer service  scope of capabilities  installation quality and financial strength 
although the relative importance of such factors varies between customers and among product categories  price is often a primary factor 
home center retailers  which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and small contractors  may in the future intensify their marketing efforts directly to professional homebuilders 
our ability to maintain our leadership positions in the markets we serve and to grow the businesses depends to a large extent upon our success in maintaining our relationships with major customers  managing our cost structure and introducing new products that appeal to changing consumer preferences 
our operating results are affected by the cost and availability of labor and materials 
when we incur cost increases for raw materials  such as copper  brass and particle board  and for energy and other commodities  it may be difficult for us to completely offset the impact with price increases on a timely basis due to outstanding commitments to customers  competitive considerations and our customers resistance to accepting such price increases 
some of our operations  including the installation and other services segment  encounter shortages or unusual price increases in raw materials  including insulation  from time to time 
a substantial decrease in the availability of raw materials from suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our results of operations 
although the availability of qualified employees is important throughout the entire company  this is particularly applicable to our installation and other services segment  because of its labor intensive installation business 
significant changes in federal  state and local regulations addressing immigration and wages  as well as collective bargaining arrangements affecting wages and working conditions  could adversely affect the performance of our businesses 
international developments have an increasing impact on our business 
over percent of our sales are derived outside of north america principally in europe and are transacted in currencies other than us dollars principally european euros and great britain pounds 
our international business faces risks associated with changes in political  monetary  economic and social environments  local labor conditions and practices  the laws  regulations and policies of foreign governments  cultural differences and differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 
us laws affecting activities of us companies abroad  including tax laws and laws regulating various business practices  also impact our international business 
our international operating results have been adversely influenced in the past when compared to our north american results  in part due to relative softness in the european markets and competitive pricing pressures on certain products 
increasingly  we are sourcing products from outside north america  principally in asia  and selling products in international markets 
differing international business practices  shipping and delivery requirements  and laws and regulations applicable to our business in these markets have raised the 
table of contents complexity of managing our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling 
our operating results can fluctuate based on changes in currency exchange rates  which presents difficulty in comparing operating performance from period to period 
we have financial commitments and investments in financial assets  including assets that are not readily marketable and involve financial risk 
we have maintained investments in marketable securities and a number of private equity funds 
since there is no active trading market for investments in private equity funds  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
in addition  we have commitments that require us to contribute additional capital to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 
product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 
increasingly  homebuilders  including our customers  are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business 
our contractual commitments to these customers typically include the agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install 
we are also subject to product safety regulations  recalls and direct claims for product liability  including putative class actions 
product liability claims can result in significant liability and  regardless of the ultimate outcome  can be costly to defend 
also  we increasingly rely on other manufacturers to provide us with products or components for products we sell 
because we do not have direct control over the quality of such products  we are exposed to the risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial and business analysis below provides information which the company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting the company s views about its future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and  accordingly  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
readers should consider that various factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors of this report  the executive level overview  critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections  may affect the company s performance 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
executive level overview the company manufactures  distributes and installs home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  builders  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in north america and europe including repair and remodeling and new home construction  the importance of and the company s relationships with key customers including the home depot  which represented approximately percent of the company s net sales in  the company s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its us and global markets in the face of increasing competition  the company s ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure and the cost and availability of labor and materials 
the company s international business faces political  monetary  economic and other risks that vary from country to country  as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
further  the company has financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk 
in addition  product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 
these and other factors are discussed in more detail in item a risk factors of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition and receivables the company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered 
the company records revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of labor incurred in the installation and other services segment  such amounts are recorded in receivables 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on an ongoing basis  the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 
financial investments the company has maintained investments in marketable securities and a number of private equity funds  which aggregated million and million  respectively  at december  investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized  net of tax effect  through shareholders equity  as a component of other comprehensive income 
the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary 
the company s investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for potential impairment when impairment indicators are present  or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred  that may have a significant adverse affect on the fair value of the investment 
impairment indicators the company considers include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance  asset quality or business prospects  a significant adverse change in the regulatory  economic or technological environment  a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates  and  any bona fide offers to purchase for less than the carrying value 
since there is no active trading market for these investments  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
in november  the company reduced its common equity ownership in metaldyne corporation metaldyne formerly mascotech  inc through a recapitalization merger with an affiliate of heartland industrial partners  lp heartland  a private equity fund in which the company had a remaining investment of million at december  representing less than five percent of the fund 
the company in that transaction retained six percent of the common equity of metaldyne 
at december   the company also held preferred stock of metaldyne  which accrues dividends at the annual rate of percent 
additionally  the company owned an approximate percent investment in trimas corporation trimas common stock 
investments in metaldyne and trimas are accounted for on the cost basis 
during  based upon a review of new information from the heartland fund concerning fund investments and the continued deterioration of conditions in the automotive supplier and transportation products markets served by metaldyne and trimas  the company determined that the decline in the estimated value of certain of its financial investments was other than temporary 
accordingly  in the 
table of contents second quarter of  the company recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment charge aggregating million for its investments in metaldyne million  trimas million  the heartland fund million and another fund million which invested in automotive and transportation related suppliers  including metaldyne and trimas 
additionally  based upon the company s review  the company considered the decline in the fair value of certain of its other private equity fund investments and other investments to be other than temporary and  accordingly  recognized impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  the company received new information related to its trimas investment and determined that the additional decline in the estimated value for this investment was other than temporary 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an additional non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million related to its investment in trimas 
on january   the acquisition of metaldyne by asahi tec corporation  a japanese automotive supplier  was finalized 
the combined fair value of asahi tec common and preferred stock received in exchange for the company s investment in metaldyne common and preferred stock approximates million and the company s carrying value of the metaldyne investment was million at december  as a result  a gain of approximately million will be recognized in the first quarter of any unrealized gains or losses subsequent to january   will be recognized  net of tax  through shareholders equity  as a component of other comprehensive income  in the company s consolidated balance sheet beginning in the first quarter of goodwill and other intangible assets the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  in the fourth quarter of each year  or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting business unit below its carrying amount  the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
the company s judgments are based upon historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome 
in estimating future cash flows  the company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures  and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast 
the company generally develops these forecasts based upon  among other things  recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting business units were greater than the carrying values 
any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting business unit exceeds its fair value  the company measures the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting business unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting business unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting business unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting business unit s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
this test for indicated that goodwill principally related to certain european business units was impaired 

table of contents the company recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges for goodwill of million million  after tax in the pre tax impairment charges recorded in were as follows cabinets and related products million  plumbing products million  and decorative architectural products million 
these charges  principally related to the company s european manufacturer of ready to assemble cabinets tvilum scanbirk  reflect the long term outlook for that business unit  including declining demand for certain products  as well as decreased operating profit margins 
the impairment charge for goodwill related to tvilum scanbirk resulted from two significant changes impacting the business unit throughout the year  but particularly in the fourth quarter of first  there was a fundamental shift in the european ready to assemble raw materials supply market  the change affected the cost structure for raw materials 
second  the company determined that the business unit s ability to increase selling prices and maintain revenue growth into the future has become more limited 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of the annual goodwill impairment testing  the company determined that these changes and the impact on operating profit and operating profit margins were permanent in nature 
the company reviews its other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit 
the company considers the implications of both external eg  market growth  competition and local economic conditions and internal eg  product sales  profit margins and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
employee retirement plans accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based upon vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works 
pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  compensation increases and discount rates for obligations and expenses 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within the company s consolidated financial statements in any given period 
in  the company increased its discount rate for obligations to an average of percent from percent 
the discount rate for obligations was based on the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plan s liabilities matched to the december  citigroup pension discount curve 
such rates for the company s defined benefit pension plans ranged from percent to percent  with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of percent or higher 
the assumed asset return was primarily percent  reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas no 

among other things  sfas no 
requires companies to prospectively recognize a net liability or asset and to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets  with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  such recognition did not affect the company s consolidated statements of income 
the adoption of sfas no 
was effective for the year ended december   and the effect was included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents the company s underfunded amount for its qualified defined benefit pension plans  the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets  decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to asset returns above projections  in accordance with sfas no 
 the unfunded amount has been recognized on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  qualified domestic pension plan assets in had a net return of approximately percent equal to average returns of percent for the largest  plan benchmark 
the company s projected benefit obligation for its unfunded non qualified defined benefit pension plans was million at december  compared with million at december   in accordance with sfas no 
 the unfunded amount has been recognized on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  the company expects pension expense for its qualified defined benefit pension plans to decrease by million in compared with if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was one half percent lower than the assumed asset return  the pension expense would only decrease by million 
the company expects pension expense for its non qualified defined benefit pension plans to decrease by million in compared with stock based compensation the company s long term stock incentive plan the plan replaced the long term stock incentive plan the plan in may and provides for the issuance of stock based incentives in various forms 
at december   outstanding stock based incentives were in the form of restricted long term stock awards  stock options  phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 
additionally  the company s non employee directors stock plan the plan provides for the payment of part of the compensation to non employee directors in company common stock 
the company elected to begin recording expense for stock options granted or modified subsequent to january  effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application mpa method 
the mpa method requires the company to recognize expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to january  through the remaining vesting periods 
the mpa method does not require the restatement of prior year information 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the company utilized the shortcut method to determine the tax windfall pool associated with stock options at december  for  the company recognized additional pre tax expense of million million or 
per common share  after tax  related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in addition  during  the company recognized expense of million net of income tax benefit of million as a cumulative effect of accounting change  net  related to the adoption of sfas no 
r and the change from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method of accounting for stock appreciation rights 
restricted long term stock awards long term stock awards are granted to key employees and non employee directors of the company and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as the company continues the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market 
there was million million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december   which was included as a reduction of common stock and retained earnings 
effective january   such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards  typically years except for stock awards held by grantees age or older  which vest over five years  or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age for stock awards granted prior to january   such expense is being recognized over the vesting period of the stock awards  typically years  or for executive grantees that are  or will become  retirement eligible during the vesting period  the expense is being recognized over five years  or immediately upon a grantee s retirement 
pre tax compensation expense for the annual vesting of long term stock awards was million for 
table of contents stock options stock options are granted to key employees and non employee directors of the company 
the exercise price equals the market price of the company s common stock at the grant date 
these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than years after the grant date 
the plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options  except for restoration options resulting from options granted under the plan 
restoration stock options become exercisable six months from the date of grant 
the company measures compensation expense for stock options using a black scholes option pricing model 
for stock options granted subsequent to january   such expense is being recognized ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options  typically five years  or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age the expense for unvested stock options at january  is based upon the grant date fair value of those options as calculated using a black scholes option pricing model for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
for stock options granted prior to january   such expense is being recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock options  typically five years  or immediately upon a grantee s retirement 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility factor and expected option life years 
for sfas no 
r calculation purposes  the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares  including restoration options  granted in was per option share 
if the company increased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in would increase percent 
if the company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in would decrease percent 
income taxes the company has considered potential sources of future foreign taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets related to its after tax foreign tax credit carryforward of million at december  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
other commitments and contingencies certain of the company s products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product 
at the time of sale  the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products  parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent that the company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 
a significant portion of the company s business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers 
a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return 
however  certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from the company 
the company s revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue  and deductions are recorded at the time of sale 
the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims including income taxes with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon the professional knowledge and experience of 
table of contents management and its legal counsel 
when estimates of the company s exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent developments 
see note t to the company s consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain legal proceedings involving the company

recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 quantifying financial statement misstatements  sab 
historically  the company evaluated financial statement misstatements using an iron curtain method  which primarily focused on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the statement of income 
sab clarified that the evaluation of financial statement misstatements must be made based upon all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  this is referred to as a dual approach 
sab is effective for the year ended december  the adoption of sab did not have an effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the adoption of sfas no 
is effective january  the company is currently evaluating the impact that the provisions of sfas no 
will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  fin no 

fin no 
allows the recognition of only those income tax benefits that have a greater than percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
fin no 
also provides guidance on classification  interest and 
table of contents penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the adoption of fin no 
is effective january  historically  the company has established reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 

under this standard  reserves for tax contingencies are established when it is probable that an additional tax may be owed and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
fin no 
establishes a lower threshold for recognizing reserves for income tax contingencies on uncertain tax positions than the thresholds under sfas no 
therefore  although the company has not completed its evaluation of the impact of fin no 
on its consolidated financial statements  it currently estimates that its reserves for income tax contingencies net of any federal tax benefit will increase by approximately million to million  as of the date of adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying fin no 
will be recorded as a reduction to beginning retained earnings in the company believes that  in future years  there will be a greater potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this lower threshold allows changes in the income tax environment to affect the tax reserve computation to a greater degree than sfas no 
in addition  the company expects to reclassify the majority of its reserves for income tax contingencies from current to non current liabilities in accordance with the provisions of fin no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
 disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
the company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related to its marketable securities and other investments 
the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s derivative instruments 
the derivatives used by the company for the year ended december  consist of interest rate swap agreements entered into in for the purpose of effectively converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
the company  including certain european operations  also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations related primarily to the european euro and the great britain pound 
at december   the company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of basis points in average interest rates  a percent change in foreign currency exchange rates or a percent decline in the market value of the company s long term investments 
based upon the analyses performed  such changes would not be expected to materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
