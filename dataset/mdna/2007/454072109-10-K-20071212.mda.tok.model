table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets our intangible assets consist of goodwill and the vantas and hydron technology 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that periodic tests of goodwill s impairment be performed and that the other intangibles be amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be indefinite 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment under a two step impairment process annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we did not record any impairment charges during the fiscal year ended september  we amortize the carrying value of the vantas and the hydron technology assets using the straight line method over useful lives of years for vantas and years for the hydron technology 
annual amortization expense is expected to be approximately million 
in fiscal  we recognized  of amortization expense 
expected terms of the agreements regarding sanctura and sanctura xr and deferred revenue as discussed above  we entered into the amended allergan agreement effective on october  the terms and conditions of this amendment required an assessment of the expected term of the agreement and our obligations thereunder 
we assessed the allergan agreement pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue number  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we determined we had multiple deliverables for which the fair value of each deliverable was not determinable and concluded that the allergan agreement represented a single unit of accounting 
our obligations are expected to cease no later than september  accordingly  commencing on the effective date of the allergan agreement  we will amortize the deferred revenue balances that existed on the effective date and the incremental license payment of million over the approximately year obligation period 
all future payments received from esprit during the approximately year obligation period will be amortized using the contingency adjusted performance model capm 
all payments received after the approximately year obligation period will be recognized as revenue when earned 
until the october  effective date of the allergan agreement  we were recording the initial and milestone payments received from pliva and esprit as deferred revenue and amortizing each component into revenue using the capm over the estimated duration of the sanctura agreement commencing on the date such payments were received 
through september   we have received  of such payments 
we believe the estimated term of the sanctura agreement is a significant estimate which affects revenue recognized and the balance of deferred revenue on our balance sheet and we explain our estimate of the expected year term of the sanctura agreement below  as of september  the sanctura agreement would have expired on the later of i the twelfth th anniversary of the launch date of sanctura or ii the expiration of the last to expire patent included in the indevus patent rights covering sanctura xr 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
table of contents specifies that unless evidence suggests otherwise  service revenues should be recognized over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period over which services are expected to be performed  if longer 
we considered the following factors in evaluating the expected duration of the sanctura agreement sanctura does not have marketing protection afforded by patents and is currently being marketed pursuant to five years of market exclusivity provided by the waxman hatch act  the potential of success in developing sanctura xr including the ultimate approval by the fda to market sanctura xr  the potential of success in obtaining approval of patents covering sanctura xr and the protection such patents may afford  if protection from patents was not obtained for sanctura xr  the potential benefit of any reliance on market exclusivity that may be provided by the waxman hatch act  the strong competition in the oab market including competition from large pharmaceutical companies 
after considering all of the above  through september  and until october   the effective date of the allergan agreement  we estimated the expected term of the sanctura agreement to be twelve years  consistent with the negotiated minimum term of the arrangement of twelve years from launch of sanctura 
we amortized   and  of deferred revenue into contract and license fee revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  and the balance of deferred revenue related to the initial and the subsequent milestone payments at september  is  commencing october   we will be recognizing revenue under the capm for all payments received under the allergan agreement for sanctura and sanctura xr see agreements 
all significant obligations under the allergan agreement are expected to be completed on or before september   being approximately five years from the effective date of the agreement 
we will be recognizing all upfront  and subsequent payments under the capm 
revenue received under the allergan agreement subsequent to september  will be recognized as earned in that period 
under the previous sanctura agreement we were recognizing milestone payments over the expected term of that agreement under a twelve year capm 
redux related liabilities at september   we have an accrued liability of approximately  for redux related expenses  including legal expenses 
the amounts we ultimately pay could differ significantly from the amount currently accrued at september  to the extent the amounts paid differ from the amounts accrued  we will record a charge or credit to the statement of operations 
insurance claim receivable as of september   we had an outstanding insurance claim of approximately  for services rendered through may  by the group of law firms defending us in the redux related product liability litigation 
the full amount of our current outstanding insurance claim is made pursuant to our product liability policy issued to us by reliance insurance company reliance  which is in liquidation proceedings 
based upon discussions with our attorneys and other consultants regarding the amount and timing of potential collection of our claim on reliance  we previously recorded a reserve against our outstanding and estimated claim receivable from reliance to reduce the balance to the estimated net realizable value of  reflecting our best estimate given the available facts and circumstances 
we believe our reserve of approximately  against the insurance claim on reliance as of september  is a significant estimate reflecting management s judgment 
to the extent we do not collect the insurance claim receivable of  we would be required to record additional charges 
alternatively  if we collect amounts in excess of the current receivable balance  we would record a credit for the additional funds received in the statement of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition policy product revenue consists primarily of revenues from sales of products  royalties  and reimbursements for royalties owed by us 
product revenue includes revenue earned from shipments of sanctura  vantas subsequent to our acquisition of valera effective april   suprellin la and delatestryl 
royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize our licensed technologies and are generally reported to us in a royalty report on a specified periodic basis 
royalty revenue is recognized in the period in which the sales of the product or technology occurred on which the royalties are based 
if the royalty report for such period is received subsequent to the time when we are required to report our results on form q or form k and the amount of the royalties earned is not estimable  royalty revenue is not recognized until a subsequent accounting period when the royalty report is received and when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to us in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement 
we record sales of product as product revenue upon the later of shipment or as title passes to our customer 
sales of vantas and delatestryl are reflected net of reserves for returns and allowances 
for supprelin la  where chargebacks  insurance reimbursement and refunds cannot be reasonably estimated  revenue is deferred until such amounts are known 
contract and license fee revenue consists of revenue from contractual initial and milestone payments received from partners  including amortization of deferred revenue from contractual payments  sales force subsidies  and grants from agencies supporting research and development activities 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license  development or co promotion agreements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of our products or product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on net product sales 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
in multiple element arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations  license fees are recognized together with any up front payment over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations  unless the delivered technology has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements in the arrangement 
we record such revenue as contract and license fee revenue 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
we record such revenue as contract and license fee revenue 
multiple element arrangements are evaluated pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue number  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
pursuant to eitf  in multiple element arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations  contract  milestone and license fees are recognized together with any up front payments over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligation  unless the delivered technology has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective  reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered element in the arrangement 
in the case of an arrangement where it is determined there is a single unit of accounting  all cash flows from the 
table of contents arrangement are considered in the determination of all revenue to be recognized 
additionally  pursuant to the guidance of securities and exchange commission sab no 
 unless evidence suggests otherwise  revenue from consideration received is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected term of the arrangements 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest available cash primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  repurchase agreements  domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
cash and cash equivalents include investments with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase 
marketable securities consist of investments purchased with maturities greater than three months and are classified as noncurrent if they mature one year or more beyond the balance sheet date and not considered available to fund current operations 
we classify our investments in debt securities as either held to maturity or available for sale based on facts and circumstances present at the time the investments are purchased 
at september  and  all investments held were classified as available for sale 
investments are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss until realized 
the fair value of these securities is based on quoted market prices 
inventory capitalization policy inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
we expense costs related to inventory until such time as fda approval is obtained for a new product  at which time we commence capitalization of costs relating to that product 
accounting for stock based compensation we have several stock based employee compensation plans 
on october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r accounting for stock based compensation sfas r using the modified prospective method  which results in the provisions of sfas r only being applied to the consolidated financial statements on a going forward basis that is  the prior period results have not been restated 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
previously  we had followed accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which resulted in the accounting for employee share options at their intrinsic value in the consolidated financial statements 
we were required to make significant estimates related to the adoption of sfas r 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on both current implied volatility and historical volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
for stock option grants issued to non executives during the fiscal years ended september  and  we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility of and  respectively 
for stock option grants to executives during the fiscal years ended september  and  we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility of and  respectively 
a higher volatility input to the black scholes model increases the resulting compensation expense 
we also determined the weighted average option life assumption based on the exercise patterns that different employee groups exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
for stock option grants made during the fiscal years ended september  and  we used a weighted average 
table of contents expected option life assumption of and years  respectively for non executives and years for executives 
a shorter expected term would result in a lower compensation expense 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  our net loss increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in april  we completed our acquisition of valera and incurred significant charges relating specifically to the transaction 
we recorded a non recurring charge of  for in process research and development related the portion of the purchase price assigned to the value of valera s unapproved product candidates 
we are also incurring approximately  of annual expense relating to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the acquisition  we reflected  of such expense in fiscal total revenues increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal product revenue includes sales of product to our customers and royalties received from our partners 
the decrease in product sales to our customers of  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal is due primarily to a  decrease in sales of sanctura to our marketing partner  esprit 
esprit reduced its orders of sanctura in fiscal as it managed its sanctura inventory in anticipation of the fda s approval of our once daily product  sanctura xr 
partially offsetting this decrease is a  increase in sanctura royalties  reflecting an increase in the minimum royalties due pursuant to the sanctura agreement 
under the allergan agreement effective as of october   contractual minimum royalties will be  annually through calendar year subject to certain conditions  we will receive increasing minimum royalties through under the allergan agreement 
in addition  fiscal product revenue included  of vantas sales as a result of our acquisition of valera in april  the increase in contract and license fee revenue of  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal is due to an increase of  in the amortization of deferred revenue related to milestone payments received from esprit in fiscal we received a  milestone in october pursuant to our filing the sanctura xr nda and a  milestone in august pursuant to the fda s approval of the product 
these milestones were accounted for consistently with our prior milestones received from esprit 
we apply the capm to these types of milestone payments 
in addition  we recognized license fee revenue from novexel of approximately  pursuant to the novexel agreement 
this was offset by a decrease of  due to a payment we received in fiscal related to our amended bucindolol license agreement 
sales force support remained relatively consistent for the years ended september  and september  at  and  respectively 
cost of product revenue decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal cost of sanctura product sales decreased  which is consistent with decreased sales of sanctura product to esprit 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in costs of  related to sales of vantas 
additionally  a  reserve was established in our first fiscal quarter of for excess delatestryl inventory 
research and development expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease reflects a reduction in development costs of  for sanctura xr   for pagoclone  and  for ip partially offsetting these decreases were increases in development costs of  for nebido and approximately  for products acquired from valera 
total research and development expense for fiscal substantially relates to our major compounds being developed as follows nebido  sanctura xr  pagoclone  pro  the octreotide implant  valstar  the biodegradable ureteral stent  supprelin la  naltrexone  vantas  and ip  
table of contents marketing  general and administrative expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal marketing expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase primarily reflected external costs related to supprelin la  vantas and pre launch activities related to nebido 
in addition  employee related expense increased approximately  due primarily to higher staffing levels as a result of our acquisition of valera in april of adding to these were increased noncash stock based compensation expense of  and other marketing and sales related activities

also included in fiscal is  of expense related to the disposition of our investment in spepharm holdings bv  a company specializing in urology products in the european union 
on april   we acquired of the outstanding stock of valera 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method 
of the  of acquired intangible assets   was allocated to in process research and development ipr d and was reflected as expense in the fiscal year ended september  because the products to which it relates had not received regulatory approval prior to the acquisition date 
the value assigned to ipr d relates to the following products supprelin la   the octreotide implant   and a ureteral stent   we believe that this charge represents a reasonable estimate of the future benefits attributed to the purchased ipr d 
the valuation was determined using an income approach 
cash flows were projected through a date commensurate with management s expectation of patent protection 
the discounted cash flow method was applied to the projected cash flows  adjusted for the probability of success using a discount rate of approximately 
the discount rate takes into consideration the uncertainty surrounding successful development and commercialization of the ipr d 
given the risks inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval process  it is possible  with the exception of supprelin la which was recently approved  that no commercial product will ever result from these product candidates 
in connection with the valera acquisition  we recorded amortization expense of  during the year ended september  related to vantas and the hydron technology intangible assets 
the annual amortization of these intangible assets is expected to be approximately  the estimated life of these intangible assets is approximately fourteen to seventeen years 
investment income decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease in investment income is primarily the result of average cash balances decreasing throughout interest expense relates to our  of convertible senior notes due in and  of convertible senior notes due in the convertible notes

fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  our net loss decreased  to  or per share  basic  in fiscal from  or per share  basic  in fiscal this reduced loss is primarily the result of increased revenues related to sanctura and decreased sales and marketing expenses  partially offset by increased research and development and general and administrative expenses

we are continuing to invest in the development of nebido 
we may purchase inventory of nebido prior to fda approval in order to be ready to launch nebido soon after approval 
we believe we have sufficient cash for currently planned expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we will require additional funds or corporate collaborations for the development and commercialization of our other product candidates  as well as any new businesses  products or technologies acquired or developed in the future 
we have no commitments to obtain such funds 
there can such be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing to satisfy future cash requirements on acceptable terms  or at all 
if such additional funds are not obtained  we may be required to delay product development and business development activities 
on august   we completed our offer to exchange the  of outstanding convertible senior notes due july the old notes  for an equal amount of our convertible senior notes due july the new notes the exchange offer 
holders of  of the old notes accepted the exchange offer 
consequently  we have  of the new notes as a component of long term liabilities 
table of contents and  of the old notes outstanding and classified as a component of current liabilities as of september  if the new notes do not convert into common stock by july   we will be required to redeem these new notes for cash

product development there can be no assurance that results of any ongoing or future pre clinical or clinical trials will be successful  that additional trials will not be required  that any drug or product under development will receive fda approval in a timely manner or at all  or that such drug or product could be successfully manufactured in accordance with us current good manufacturing practices  or successfully marketed in a timely manner  or at all  or that we will have sufficient funds to develop or commercialize any of our products 
total research and development expenses incurred by us through september  on our core development compounds  including up front and milestone payments and allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  were approximately as follows  for pro   for the octreotide implant  and  for the biodegradable ureteral stent 
we have not included compounds in development for which we do not expect to incur additional material research and development costs 
estimating costs and time to complete development of a compound is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could necessitate additional and unexpected clinical trials or other development  testing and analysis 
results of any testing could result in a decision to alter or terminate development of a compound  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
certain compounds could benefit from subsidies  grants or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 
in the event we were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing  funding or assumption by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs to be incurred by us could be substantially less than the estimates below 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult to estimate for early stage compounds due to the fact that there is generally less comprehensive data available for such compounds to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of an nda 
given the above uncertainties  and other risks  variables and considerations related to each compound and regulatory uncertainties in general  we estimate remaining research and development costs  excluding allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  from september  through the preparation of an nda for our core development compounds as follows approximately  for pro   for the octreotide implant and  for the biodegradable ureteral stent 
actual costs to complete any of our products may differ significantly from the estimates 
we cannot reasonably estimate the date of completion for any compound that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to uncertainty of the number  size  and duration of the trials which may be required to complete development 
we are currently considering strategic partners for future development and commercialization of pro and evaluating commercialization options for pagoclone in parallel with our ongoing development program and preliminary market development activities

other in june  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
this standard allows companies to present in their statements of income any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenue producing transactions between a seller and a customer  such as sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes  on either a gross included in revenue and costs or a net excluded from revenue basis 
this standard is effective for interim and fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this issue on the financial statements  but do not believe the impact of the adoption of this standard will be material 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertain tax provisions  an interpretation of sfas statement fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions as described in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and requires a company to recognize  in its financial statements  the impact of a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on an audit basis solely on the technical merit of the position 
in addition  fin requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures including a discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next twelve months as well as a roll forward of all unrecognized tax benefits 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are still evaluating the implications of this standard  but do not currently expect it to have a significant impact 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which is effective for fiscal years ending after november  sab provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment

on september   the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to do so for recognition or disclosure purposes 
the standard provides a common definition of fair value and is intended to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable as well as improving disclosures about those measures 
the standard is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after november   being for us 
this standard formalizes the measurement principles to be utilized in determining fair value for purposes such as derivative valuation and impairment analysis 
we are still evaluating the implications of this standard  but do not currently expect it to have a significant impact

sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
on june   the fasb reached a final consensus on emerging issues task force issue  accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
currently  under fasb statement no 
 accounting for research and development costs  nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities for materials  equipment  facilities  and purchased intangible assets that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred 
eitf addresses whether such non refundable advance payments for goods or services that have no alternative future use and that will be used or rendered for research and development activities should be expensed when the advance payments are made or when the research and development activities have been performed 
the consensus reached by the fasb requires companies involved in research and development activities to capitalize such non refundable advance payments for goods and services pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement because the right to receive those services in the future represents a probable future economic benefit 
those advance payments will be capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
entities will be required to evaluate whether they expect the goods or services to be rendered 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment will be charged to expense 
the consensus on eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is not permitted 
entities are required to recognize the effects of applying the guidance in eitf prospectively for new contracts entered into after the effective date 
we are evaluating the expected impact of eitf on our financial position and results of operations following adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk related to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  and domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars and are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
risk related to the convertible notes the fair value of our convertible notes is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates and the price of our common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible 
a decrease in the price of our common stock could result in a decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes 
for example on a very simplified basis  a decrease of of the market value of our common stock could reduce the value of a  note by approximately 
an increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the fair value of the convertible notes 
for example on a very simplified basis  an interest rate increase of could reduce the value 
table of contents of a  convertible note by approximately 
the two examples provided above are only hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the convertible notes due to fluctuations in market value of our common stock or interest rates could vary substantially from these examples
