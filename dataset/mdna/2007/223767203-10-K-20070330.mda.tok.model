market areas and competition the company s primary market areas in which it accepts deposits and makes loans are cowlitz county  in southwest washington  king county  washington  the portland metropolitan area in oregon  and the surrounding counties in washington and northwest oregon 
as a community bank  the bank has certain competitive advantages due to its local focus  but is also more closely tied to the local economy than many of its competitors  which serve a number of geographic markets 
bay mortgage operations are concentrated in southwestern washington 
according to the us department of labor bureau of labor statistics website  both washington th at and oregon th at were among the states with relatively high unemployment rates during december after significant decreases in the unemployment rates for both washington and oregon in  overall unemployment rates in these states decreased slightly in continued improvement in employment rates was evident in all of the bank s primary markets  though at a lesser pace than the portland vancouver metropolitan area unemployment rate fell to  the seattle metropolitan area s rate fell to and the unemployment rate in the longview area in cowlitz county  washington  declined to

in cowlitz county  washington  the location of the company s headquarters  residential and commercial construction fueled the county s strong job growth for the second straight year 
management is cautiously optimistic that the positive employment trends will continue as the pacific northwest economy continues to strengthen 
the major competition for commercial and mortgage banking services in cowlitz county comes from traditional banking and thrift institutions  as well as non bank financial service providers such as credit unions and mortgage companies 
several of these competitors are not headquartered in cowlitz county and many have relocated key functions such as loan decisions to regional offices outside of the area 
due to their larger capital bases  major banks and super regional banks have significantly larger lending limits than the company and generally have more expansive branch networks 
community banks located in longview also compete with the company and offer community based decision making and the personal service associated with community banking 
the bay bank branches in bellevue and seattle  washington and in the portland area are faced with a large number of national  regional and local competitors 
non traditional banking entities such as investment banking firms  insurance companies  payday loan offices and related industries offering bank like products  have also increased competition for deposits and loans 
employees as of december   the company employed a total of full time equivalent employees 
none of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the company considers its relationships with its employees to be favorable 

table of contents regulation and supervision the company and the bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulations that significantly affect the respective activities of the company and the bank and the competitive environment in which they operate 
these laws and regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors and the deposit insurance fund  rather than shareholders 
the description of the laws and regulations applicable to the company and the bank is not a complete description of the laws and regulations mentioned herein or of all such laws and regulations 
any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the company and the bank 
the bank is a state chartered commercial bank  which is not a member of the federal reserve system  and is subject to primary regulation and supervision by the department of financial institutions of the state of washington dfi and by the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic  which also insures bank deposits

bank holding company regulation 
the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended bhca and  as such  is subject to the regulations of the federal reserve 
bank holding companies are required to file periodic reports with  and are subject to periodic examination by  the federal reserve 
the federal reserve has issued regulations under the bhca requiring bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks 
it is the policy of the federal reserve that  pursuant to this requirement  a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital to fund its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
additionally  under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become undercapitalized as defined in the statute with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency up to the lesser of i an amount equal to of the institution s total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized  or ii the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan 
under the bhca  the federal reserve has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a non bank subsidiary other than a non bank subsidiary of a bank upon the federal reserve s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company 
capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies 
the federal reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines are similar to  although not identical with  the guidelines applicable to banks 
see fdicia and capital requirements 
bank regulation 
the bank is organized under the laws of the state of washington and is subject to the supervision of the dfi  whose examiners conduct periodic examinations of state banks 
cowlitz bank is not a member of the federal reserve system  so its principal federal regulator is the fdic  which also conducts periodic examinations of the bank 
the bank s deposits are insured  to the maximum extent permitted by law  by the deposit insurance fund dif administered by the fdic and are subject to the fdic s rules and regulations respecting the insurance of deposits 
see deposit insurance 
both federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements  truth in lending and truth in savings disclosures  equal credit opportunity  fair credit reporting  trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations 
current federal law also requires banks  among other things  to make deposited funds available within specified time periods 

table of contents insured state chartered banks are generally prohibited under fdicia from engaging as principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks  unless i the fdic determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund  and ii the bank is  and continues to be  in compliance with all applicable capital standards 
the company believes that these restrictions do not have a material adverse effect on its current operations 
fdicia 
fdicia requires  among other things  federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  fdicia establishes five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the fdic has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
among other things  the regulations define the relevant capital measures for the five capital categories 
an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to a regulatory order  agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
the federal reserve board classifies a bank holding company as well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater and a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater 
the company and the bank are both well capitalized 
fdicia further directs that each federal banking agency prescribe standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  management compensation  a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital  minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses  a minimum ratio of market value to book value of publicly traded shares and such other standards as the agency deems appropriate 
capital requirements 
the fdic has adopted risk based capital ratio guidelines to which the bank is subject 
the guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
these guidelines divide a bank s capital into two tiers 
tier includes common equity  certain non cumulative perpetual preferred stock excluding auction rate issues and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets except mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships  subject to certain limitations 
supplementary tier capital includes  among other items  preferred stock cumulative perpetual and long term  limited life  mandatory convertible securities  certain hybrid capital instruments  term subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses  subject to certain limitations  less required deductions 
banks are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of  of which must be tier capital 
the fdic may  however  set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant 
banks experiencing or anticipating significant growth are expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions  well above the minimum levels 
in addition  the fdic has established guidelines prescribing a minimum tier leverage ratio tier capital to adjusted total assets of for banks that meet certain specified criteria  including that the banks have the highest regulatory rating and are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
all other banks are required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of not less than 

table of contents at december   the regulatory capital ratios for the company and the bank were december  company bank total risk based capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage ratio dividends 
the principal source of the company s cash revenues is dividends from the bank 
under washington law  the bank may not pay dividends in an amount greater than its retained earnings as determined by generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition  dfi has the authority to require a state chartered bank to suspend the payment of dividends 
the fdic has the authority to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if  in its opinion  the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank or if it would cause a bank to become undercapitalized 
lending limits 
under washington law  the total loans and extensions of credit by a washington chartered bank to a borrower outstanding at one time may not exceed of the bank s tier capital 
however  this limitation does not apply to loans or extensions of credit which are fully secured by readily marketable collateral having market value of at least of the amount of the loan or the extension of credit at all times 
branches and affiliates 
establishment of bank branches is subject to approval of the dfi and fdic and geographic limits established by state laws 
washington s branch banking law permits a bank having its principal place of business in the state of washington to establish branch offices in any county in washington without geographic restrictions 
a bank may also merge with any national or state chartered bank located anywhere in the state of washington without geographic restrictions 
under oregon law  an out of state bank or bank holding company may merge with or acquire an oregon state chartered bank or bank holding company if the oregon bank  or in the case of a bank holding company  the subsidiary bank  has been in existence for a minimum of three years  and the law of the state in which the acquiring bank is located permits such merger 
branches may not be acquired or opened separately  but once an out of state bank has acquired branches in oregon  either through a merger with or acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an oregon bank  the bank may open additional branches 
the bank is subject to provisions of the federal reserve act that restrict financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies 
the statute limits credit transactions between a bank and its executive officers and its affiliates  prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices  and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank s extension of credit to an affiliate 
deposit insurance 
the bank s deposits are insured by the deposit insurance fund dif 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of reform act  enacted in february  increased the deposit insurance limit for certain retirement plan deposit accounts from  to  the basic insurance limit for other deposits  including individuals  joint account holders  businesses  government entities  and trusts  remains at  the bank s deposits were previously insured by the bank insurance fund  which was merged with the savings association insurance fund to form the dif in march as an institution whose deposits are insured by dif  the bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums to dif 
fdic regulations set deposit insurance premiums based upon the risks a particular bank or savings association poses to the deposit insurance fund 
this system bases an institution s risk category partly upon whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
each insured depository institution is also assigned to one of three supervisory categories based on reviews by regulators  statistical analysis of financial statements and other relevant information 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned 

table of contents for  the assessment rates ranged from to per of deposits annually 
for the year  the bank s assessment rate was 
the reform act created a new system and assessment rate schedule to calculate an institution s assessment 
the new base assessment rates per the reform act range from to per of deposits annually 
management estimates that the bank s annual assessment rate for will be per of deposits 
the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi annual basis in order to manage the dif to prescribed statutory target levels 
under legislation enacted in to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund  the fdic is authorized to collect assessments against insured deposits to be paid to the financing corporation fico to service fico debt incurred in the s 
the current fico assessment rate for dif insured deposits are per of deposits per year 
an increase in deposit or fico assessments could have an adverse effect on the bank s earnings  depending upon the amount of the increase 
gramm leach bliley act 
on november   the gramm leach bliley act the glb act was signed into law  which significantly reformed various aspects of the financial services business 
among other things  the glb act established a new framework under which bank holding companies and banks can own securities firms  insurance companies and other financial companies  provided consumers with new protections regarding the transfer and use of their non public personal information by financial institutions  and changed the federal home loan bank fhlb system in numerous ways revising the manner of calculating the resolution funding corporation obligations payable by the fhlb and broadening the purposes for which fhlb advances may be used 
community reinvestment act 
the community reinvestment act cra requires financial institutions regulated by the federal financial supervisory agencies to ascertain and help meet the credit needs of their delineated communities  including low income and moderate income neighborhoods within those communities  while maintaining safe and sound banking practices 
the regulatory agency assigns one of four possible ratings to an institution s cra performance and is required to make public an institution s rating and written evaluation 
the four possible ratings are outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve and substantial non compliance 
many factors play a role in assessing a financial institution s cra performance 
the institution s regulator must consider its financial capacity and size  legal impediments  local economic conditions and demographics and the competitive environment in which it operates 
the evaluation does not rely on absolute standards and financial institutions are not required to perform specific activities or to provide specific amounts or types of credit 
the company s most recent rating under cra is satisfactory 
this rating reflects the company s commitment to meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves 
although the company strives to maintain a satisfactory or higher rating  no assurance can be given that the company will maintain this rating in the future 
if the company s cra rating were to fall below satisfactory it may inhibit its ability to obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions or expansion 
sarbanes oxley 
effective july   the sarbanes oxley act of addressed public company corporate governance  auditing  accounting  executive compensation  and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information 
the sarbanes oxley act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and to state corporate law  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees 

table of contents the sarbanes oxley act and related sec regulations provides for  among other matters a prohibition on personal loans by cowlitz to its directors and executive officers except loans in the ordinary course of business made by the bank  independence requirements for board audit committee members and the company s auditors  certification of exchange act reports by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer  disclosure of off balance sheet transactions  expedited reporting of stock transactions by insiders  internal and disclosure controls and procedures requirements  and increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws 
usa patriot act 
in response to the terrorist attacks of september  president bush signed the usa patriot act into law on october  the act requires financial institutions to  among other things  establish an anti money laundering program  and due diligence procedures with respect to private banking accounts involving foreign individuals 
the act requires federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of the bank s anti money laundering program  including enhanced record keeping and reporting procedures  when reviewing applications relating to mergers and acquisitions 
additional matters 
the company and the bank are subject to additional regulation of their activities  including a variety of consumer protection regulations affecting lending  deposit and collection activities and regulations affecting secondary mortgage market activities 
the earnings of financial institutions  including the company and the bank  are also affected by general economic conditions and prevailing interest rates  both domestic and foreign and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its various agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
additional legislation and administrative actions affecting the banking industry may be considered by the united states congress  the washington legislature and various regulatory agencies  including those referred to above 
it cannot be predicted with certainty whether such legislation or administrative action will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry in general or the company and the bank in particular would be affected 
item a 
risk factors the company is extremely sensitive to the economy of the pacific northwest 
the company operates primarily in cowlitz county  washington  the seattle bellevue metropolitan area  and the vancouver  washington and portland  oregon metropolitan area 
local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the ability of the company s customers to repay loans  the value of collateral securing loans  the demand for the company s products and services  and the stability of deposits that create liquidity to support lending activities 
these areas have enjoyed positive employment trends recently but if the recovery is not as strong as anticipated in the region or the region experiences an economic downturn  the company could be adversely affected because demand for our products and services could decline and our borrowers may be unable to repay 
table of contents loans 
numerous factors could cause the economy to slow down or recede including higher interest rates  inflation  reduced consumer or corporate spending  natural disasters  terrorist activities and the normal cycles of the economy 
the company has a concentration of real estate collateral securing loans 
many of the company s loans are secured by real estate located in washington and oregon 
if these locales experience an economic downturn that adversely affects real estate values and customers ability to repay  credit losses may exceed the estimates that are currently included in the allowance for credit losses  which could adversely affect financial results and shareholder value 
interest rates are subject to constant  often unpredictable changes 
the company s earnings are largely derived from net interest income  which includes interest and fees earned on loans and investment income  less interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of management  including general economic conditions  and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
as interest rates change  net interest income is affected 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  if rates paid on deposits and other sources of funds increase faster than rates received on loans and investment  the company s net interest income could be adversely affected 
similarly  if rates received on loans in a falling interest rate environment decrease faster than rates paid on deposits and other sources of funds  the company net interest income could be adversely affected 
with fixed rate assets such as fixed rate loans and liabilities such as certificates of deposit  the effect on net interest income depends on the maturities of the assets and liabilities 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to moderate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability position to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s gap position and sensitivity to interest rate risk by subjecting the company s balance sheet to hypothetical interest rate shocks 
in a falling rate environment  the spread between interest yields earned and interest rates paid may narrow in the short term  depending on the relative level of fixed and variable rate assets and liabilities 
in an increasing rate environment the company s prime rate based variable rate loans will increase immediately with changes in the prime rate  while fixed rate liabilities  particularly certificates of deposit will only reprice as the liability matures so the immediate affect can be a widening of the interest rate spread 
however  as interest rates eventually stabilize  the interest rate spread may narrow because interest rates paid on the company s liabilities tend to reprice more slowly than the yields earned on assets 
rapid increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our earnings a rapid increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on collateral values and borrowers ability to repay loans 
the company s targeted customers are small to medium size businesses  professionals and retail customers that may have limited capital resources to repay loans when payments increase due to significant increases in rates 
our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate 
when we make loans and loan commitments to customers  we are subject to credit risk  which is the risk of losses if borrowers do not repay their loans 
we reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance for credit losses through a charge to earnings 
management s determination of the appropriate level of its reserves requires subjective and complex judgments about the future  the process is inherently difficult and is based on numerous judgments and forecasts including economic conditions 
we may have credit losses in excess of the amount reserved and we may increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions  both of which would negatively affect our earnings 

table of contents we rely on our information technology and communications systems to conduct our business 
we depend on uninterrupted and successful functioning of our information technology and communications systems  many of which are provided by third parties 
we rely on outsourced systems to provide customer service and complete banking transactions 
disruptions in these systems could affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers 
if a third party service provider experiences operational or financial difficulties that interfere with their ability to serve us  our operations could be harmed 
the financial services industry is extremely competitive 
the company competes with well established  large banks based outside of the region  community banks  credit unions  thrift institutions  investment banking firms  insurance companies  payday loan offices and mortgage lenders for depositors and borrowers 
offices of the major financial institutions have competitive advantages over the company in that they have high public visibility  may offer a wider variety of products and are able to maintain advertising and marketing activities on a much larger scale than the company can economically maintain 
since single borrower lending limits imposed by law are dependent on the capital of the institution  the branches of larger institutions with substantial capital bases also have an advantage with respect to loan applications that are in excess of the company s legal lending limits 
in competing for deposits  the company is subject to certain limitations not applicable to non bank financial institution competitors 
previous laws limiting the deposit instruments and lending activities of savings and loan associations have been substantially eliminated  thus increasing the competition from these institutions 
in cowlitz county  the main source of competition for deposits is the relatively large number of credit unions 
federal and state regulations applicable only to banks and bank holding companies also place banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies  credit unions  mortgage banking companies and leasing companies 
although the company has been able to compete effectively in its market area in the past  there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so 
with significant competition in the company s market areas  there can be no assurance that the company can continue to attract significant loan and deposit customers 
the inability to attract these customers could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the financial services industry is heavily regulated and additional laws and regulations are often considered at the state and federal level 
federal and state regulations are designed to protect depositors  federal deposit insurance funds  consumers and the banking system  not our shareholders 
banking regulations can significantly restrict our business 
additional laws and regulations affecting banks and bank holdings companies are often proposed at the state and federal levels  which could affect our ability to compete with non bank companies 
the operations of the company and the bank may be adversely affected by legislative and regulatory changes as well as by changes in the policies of various regulatory authorities 
the company cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects that such changes may have in the future on its business and earnings 
if we acquire companies in the future  our earnings could be reduced if we are unable to successfully integrate operations 
we explore opportunities to acquire other banks 
if we are able to find a suitable acquisition opportunity and negotiate and close a transaction  we experience difficulty in integrating an acquired company and consequently we may not realize expected revenue enhancements  cost savings  increases in geographic presence or other projected benefits 
integration could also disturb customer and employee relationships at the acquired company  causing deposit run off and loss of key employees 
resources spent on integration may also detract from our ability to grow existing business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a discussion of significant business trends and uncertainties as well as certain forward looking statements and is intended to be read in conjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the consolidated financial statements of the company and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements  see item a 
risk factors and the risk factors discussed on page immediately following the table of contents 
results of operations overview for the year ended december   the company recorded net income of million  or per diluted share of common stock per share 
this compares with net income of million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the corresponding periods ended december   and  respectively 
average loans in totaled million  an increase of over  and up significantly from million in this loan growth  primarily in commercial and real estate loans  was funded mostly with non interest bearing deposits  certificates of deposits and proceeds from issuance of junior subordinated debentures in april of average non interest bearing deposits increased in compared with on october   the company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of aea bancshares  inc aea  the parent company of asia europe americas bank  in an acquisition accounted for as a purchase 
financial results for included the results of operations of aea from the date of acquisition 
therefore  when comparing and results  the year included only two months of combined operations 
aea had loans of million and deposits of million at acquisition date 
net interest income grew to million  an increase of over results  and over results 
the net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was in  compared with and in and  respectively 
the average yield on interest earning assets in increased basis points bp bp is equal to compared with  while interest expense to average interest earning assets increased basis points 
the company s provision for credit losses was million in  compared with million in the increase reflected strong loan growth  but also included the impact of a million charge off due to a loss on a nationally syndicated equipment lease related to an alleged accounting fraud 
at december   total non performing assets were million compared with million at year end and million at december  the increase in non performing assets from december  to december  was primarily related to loans acquired from aea 
the company sold the majority of aea impaired assets shortly after the acquisition and retained certain non performing loans totaling million where minimal loss was expected 
non performing assets related to the company s loan portfolio prior to the acquisition of aea totaled million or about of the total loan portfolio at december  non performing loans were reduced to one loan at december   which totaled million and is fully guaranteed by a us government agency 
non interest income and non interest expenses in increased significantly when compared with  reflecting the late acquisition of aea and an overall higher level of staffing  occupancy  data processing and branch activities due to loan growth  two additional branches and the expansion of the company s international trade finance capabilities 
critical accounting policies the company s most critical accounting policy is related to the allowance for credit losses 
the company utilizes both quantitative and qualitative considerations in establishing an allowance for credit losses believed to be appropriate as of each reporting date 

table of contents quantitative factors include the volume and severity of non performing loans and adversely classified credits  the level of net charge offs experienced on previously classified loans  the nature and value of collateral securing the loans  the trend in loan growth and the percentage of change  the level of geographic and or industry concentration  the relationship and trend over the past several years of recoveries in relation to charge offs  and other known factors regarding specific loans 
qualitative factors include the effectiveness of credit administration  the adequacy of loan review  the adequacy of loan operations personnel and processes  the effect of competitive issues that impact loan underwriting and structure  the impact of economic conditions  and the introduction of new loan products or specific marketing efforts 
changes in the above factors could significantly affect the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
management performs a full analysis  no less often than quarterly  to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are adjusted on a timely basis 
for further discussion of this significant management estimate  see allowance for credit losses 
another critical accounting policy of the company is that related to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of goodwill on january  and periodically tests intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment 
impairment analysis of the fair value of goodwill involves a substantial amount of judgment  as does establishing and monitoring estimated amounts and lives of other intangible assets 
for  the company s application of sfas no 
 business combinations was considered critical  given the acquisition of aea  as well as statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer  which addresses the accounting for certain loans acquired in a transfer when it is probable  at acquisition  that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable 
management recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values  and allocated a portion of the purchase price in excess of the net assets acquired to core deposit intangibles  with the remaining balance to goodwill 
as part of the purchase accounting at the time of acquisition  management evaluated all loans acquired in accordance with sop  and those considered impaired were brought over at their respective fair values 
sop was not applied to loans for which management considered it probable that all contractual payments would be collected 
principal recoveries in excess of the established carrying value of acquired loans that were received within the first year after the acquisition date were recorded as a reduction to goodwill and not as income 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing 
table of contents model 
this involves assumptions calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net interest income for financial institutions  the primary component of earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and other borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to total interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  the total dollar amount of interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  the resulting yields or costs  net interest income  and net interest spread 
non accrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield

total average earning assets increased million in to million  compared with million in average loans in increased million  reflecting the company s expanded lending staff  the strong economy in the pacific northwest during the period and the acquisition of aea in late the average yield on earning assets increased bp  primarily due to the increase in market interest rates during the first six months of the bank s prime rate stood at at year end  unchanged from late june  as the federal reserve had not adjusted its benchmark interest rate since that time 
the bank s prime rate on january  was 
approximately two thirds of the company s loan portfolio was composed of variable rate loans during comparing to  total average interest earning assets increased million  as the average yields earned increased bp the increase in average earnings assets was due to an increase of million  or  in average loans 
average loans in increased approximately as a result of the aea acquisition  and the remainder of the increase was due to loan growth from the remainder of the bank  primarily in commercial and real estate loans 
the bank s prime rate increased from as of the beginning of to as of december  interest bearing liabilities 
as with earning assets  the rising market interest rate environment led to a bp increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the average rate paid in was  compared with in the company s loan growth in exceeded its growth in non interest bearing and low cost deposits  and the balance of the funding need was met primarily through certificates of deposit 
the average rate paid on certificates of deposit in was compared with in  an increase of bp the year experienced a negatively sloped yield curve  with short term interest rates rising substantially more than longer term interest rates 

table of contents in  the rising interest rate environment led to higher average rates paid for deposits and other borrowings as compared with the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased to in from in average rates on savings and interest bearing demand deposits increased bp  and average rates on certificates of deposits increased bp in addition to the increase in non interest bearing deposits  loan growth was funded primarily by an increase in certificates of deposit and the issuance of junior subordinated securities 
provision for credit losses the amount of the allowance for credit losses is analyzed by management on a regular basis to ensure that it is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the reporting date 
when a provision for credit losses is recorded  the amount is based on the current volume of loans and commitments to extend credit  anticipated changes in loan volumes  past charge off experience  management s assessment of the risk of loss on current loans  the level of non performing and impaired loans  evaluation of future economic trends in the company s market area  and other factors relevant to the loan portfolio 
an internal loan risk grading system is used to evaluate potential losses of individual loans 
the company does not  as part of its analysis  group loans together by loan type to assign risk 
see the allowance for credit losses disclosure for a more detailed discussion 
the company s provision for credit losses was million for the year ended december   compared with  and  the years ending december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for credit losses compared with reflected strong loan growth  but also included the impact of a million charge off in due to a loss on a nationally syndicated equipment lease related to an alleged accounting fraud 
in  over of loan and lease charge offs were non real estate related 
at december   approximately of the loan portfolio was secured by real estate 
the higher provision for credit losses in relative to was due to loan growth and a higher level of charge offs  primarily due to one real estate loan 
the provision for reflected the improvement in asset quality from prior years  measured in part by the decline in non performing loans in  and was also reduced by  in recoveries of loans previously charged off by the company s former subsidiary  business finance corporation 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was of total loans compared to and at december  and  respectively 
if loan volumes continue to increase  or if the overall quality of the portfolio were to decline  provisions for loan losses would be expected to increase in future periods

table of contents almost every type of non interest expense was higher in compared with these increases primarily reflected an overall higher level of staffing  occupancy  data processing and branch activities due to loan growth and two additional branches 
in addition to the seattle branch acquisition  the company opened a full service branch in vancouver  washington in the first quarter of and added an international trade finance department in the second quarter of at december   the company had full time equivalent employees compared with at december  and at december  also included in salary expenses are normal wage increases for existing employees  which generally range from three to six percent each year  as well as employee performance awards and incentive compensation plans tied to the company s financial performance 
one measure of the company s ability to contain non interest expenses is the efficiency ratio calculated by dividing total non interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non interest income 
the company s efficiency ratio was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
professional fees include exam and audit expenses  consulting costs  legal fees  and other professional fees 
in  expenses for outside professional services increased over prior year levels primarily due to the outsourcing of the company s internal audit function  which was previously staffed internally  and the initiation of the company s efforts to comply with sarbanes oxley act section requirements for data processing and communications were also significantly higher in compared with beginning in august  the company outsourced its core processing  lending  and internet banking systems to a third party service provider 
these system conversions are expected to improve long term operating and financial reporting efficiencies  as well as provide the infrastructure to support the company s plans for growth

the company records its proportionate share of operating losses and tax credits related to these investments are recorded as a component of the tax provision 
the fdic has regulations establishing a system for setting deposit insurance premiums based upon the risks a particular bank or savings association poses to the deposit insurance fund 
this system bases an institution s risk category partly upon whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized 
each insured depository institution is also assigned to one of three supervisory categories based on reviews by regulators  statistical analysis of financial statements and other relevant information 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned 
annual assessment rates in ranged from no charge for the highest rated institution to per of domestic deposits for an institution in the lowest category 
during the first six months of  the bank paid an assessment rate of per of domestic deposits 
the bank was not required to pay an assessment rate from mid through year end in addition  under legislation enacted in to recapitalize the savings association insurance fund  the fdic is authorized to collect assessments against insured deposits to be paid to the financing corporation fico to service fico debt incurred in the s

table of contents the mix of available for sale and held to maturity investment securities is considered in the context of the company s overall asset liability management policy and illustrates management s assessment of the relative liquidity of the company 
the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects management s strategy regarding maintenance of an appropriate level of liquidity  while providing a relatively stable source of interest income 
management utilizes the securities portfolio to mitigate interest rate risk and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio

table of contents allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of potential losses as of the date of the financial statements and includes the allowance for loan losses and the company s liability for unfunded credit commitments 
during the first quarter of  the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to unfunded credit commitments  such as letters of credit and the available portion of credit lines  was reclassified from the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities on the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
prior period amounts were not material 
the loan portfolio is regularly reviewed to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining the level of the allowance  the company estimates losses inherent in all loans and commitments to make loans  and evaluates non performing loans to determine the amount  if any  necessary for a specific reserve 
an important element in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is an analysis of loans by loan risk rating categories 
at a loan s inception and periodically throughout the life of the loan  management evaluates the credit risk by using a risk rating system 
this grading system currently includes eleven levels of risk 
risk ratings range from for the strongest credits to for the weakest 
a rated loan would normally represent a loss 
all loans rated are collectively the company s watch list 
the specific grades from are watch list risk rating  special mention risk rating  substandard risk rating  doubtful risk rating  and loss risk rating 
when indicators such as operating losses  collateral impairment or delinquency problems show that a credit may have weakened  the credit will be downgraded as appropriate 
similarly  as borrowers bring loans current  show improved cash flows or improve the collateral position of a loan  the credits may be upgraded 
the result of management s ongoing evaluations and the risk ratings of the portfolio is an allowance with four components specific reserves  general reserves  special reserves  and an amount available for other factors 
specific reserves 
loans on the company s watch list  as described above  are specifically reviewed and analyzed 
management considers in its analysis expected future cash flows  the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
when significant conditions or circumstances exist on an individual loan indicating greater risk  specific reserves may be allocated in addition to the general reserve percentage for that particular risk rating  as outlined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
general reserves 
all loans are risk rated to those that do not require a specific allocation are subject to a general allocation based upon historic loss factors 
management determines these factors by analyzing the volume and mix of the existing loan portfolio  in addition to other factors 
management also analyzes the following the volume and severity of non performing loans and adversely classified credits  the level of net charge offs experienced on previously classified loans  the nature and value of collateral securing the loans  and the relationship and trend over the past several years of recoveries in relation to charge offs 
special reserves 
from time to time  special reserves will be established to facilitate a change in the bank s strategy and other factors 
special allocations are to take into consideration various factors that include  but are not limited to effectiveness of credit administration  adequacy of loan review  loan operations  the trend in loan growth and the percentage of change  
table of contents concentrations both geographic and industry  competitive issues that impacts loan underwriting structure  economic conditions  and introduction of various loan products and or special marketing 
amounts available for other factors 
management also attempts to ensure that the overall allowance appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of expected loan losses 
the quarterly analysis of specific  general  and special allocations of the allowance is the principal method relied upon by management to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are adjusted on a timely basis 
the inclusion of historical loss factors in the process of determining the general component of the allowance also acts as a self correcting mechanism of management s estimation process  as loss experience more remote in time is replaced by more recent experience 
in its analysis of the specific  the general  and special allocations of the allowance  management also considers regulatory guidance in addition to the company s own experience 
liability for unfunded credit commitments 
management determines the adequacy of the liability for unfunded credit commitments based upon reviews of individual credit facilities  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of commitments and other relevant factors 
the liability is based on estimates  which are evaluated on a regular basis  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
loans and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
draws on unfunded commitments that are considered uncollectible at the time funds are advanced are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
provisions for unfunded commitment losses are added to the liability for unfunded commitments  which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net charge offs when and if they occur 
the related provision for credit losses that is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level determined through the above process 
the following table shows the components of the allowance for credit losses at the dates indicated december  december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent general specific special available for other factors total allowance for credit losses the increase in the general reserve in primarily related to strong loan growth and changes in the mix of risk rated loans 
the change in the special reserve reflected management s assessment of various factors  which are noted above under special reserves 
the company believes that the allowance for credit losses at december  is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the best information available 
this assessment  based in part on historical levels of net charge offs  loan growth and a detailed review of the quality of the loan portfolio  involves uncertainty and judgment  and  therefore  the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examinations of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for credit losses in future periods if the results of their review warrant it

in  over of the company s loan and lease charge offs were non real estate related 
the company believes the quality of its assets continues to be strong  and that it has an effective credit review process and appropriate methodology for addressing problem exposures 
the higher provision for credit losses in reflected loan growth and the higher level of charge offs 
the increase in charge offs in compared with related primarily to one real estate loan 
loans charged to the allowance peaked during and were attributable to management s strategy to expedite improvement in the quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
a part of this strategy included selling  at a discount  certain loans during these loan sales  which totaled million  accounted for approximately million of the loan losses charged to the allowance during the provisions recorded during and were 
table of contents much lower than during prior periods  primarily due to declines in loan volumes and the strengthening of overall credit quality 
in addition  the holding company received recoveries related to loans previously charged off at its finance subsidiary  business finance corporation  which was sold during the recoveries were recognized as an offset against the provision for credit losses 
recoveries through the holding company were  and  during and  respectively 
non performing assets non performing loans include all loans greater than days past due with respect to either principal or interest  and all loans to which the accrual of interest has been suspended 
these loans  combined with repossessed real estate and other repossessed assets  are collectively considered to be non performing assets 
the following table presents information on all non performing assets december  dollars in thousands loans on non accrual status loans past due greater than days but not on non accrual status total non performing loans other real estate owned other repossessed assets total non performing assets total assets percentage of non performing assets to total assets total non performing assets decreased to of total assets at december  from at year end loans on non accrual at december  consisted of a single loan fully guaranteed by an agency of the us government 
the workout period for this loan is expected to continue into other repossessed assets at year end primarily related to property repossessed in connection with the foreclosed equipment lease previously discussed 
the increase in non performing assets in was primarily related to loans acquired from aea 
the company sold the majority of aea impaired assets shortly after the acquisition and retained certain non performing loans totaling million where minimal loss was expected 
loans considered impaired at acquisition and retained were recorded at their respective fair values 
the retained loans were not considered impaired for purposes of applying sop as management considered it probable that they would collect all contractually required payments 
of the total non performing loans at december   million was fully guaranteed by an agency of the us government 
another group of non performing loans  totaling million at december   was fully secured by real property and paid off in the remainder consisted primarily of one commercial loan  which was charged off in the company has made a concentrated effort during the past several years of identifying and reducing the level of non performing assets  and has undertaken a more aggressive approach relating to the collection and ultimate reduction of non performing assets 
this effort is evidenced by the significant decline in non performing assets during and principal pay downs  loan charge offs  loan sales  repossession and sale of collateral  and renegotiations with borrowers were strategies implemented by management to accomplish the significant reduction in total non performing assets 
impaired loans the company  during its normal loan review procedures  considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered to be impaired during a period of minimal delay less than days unless 
table of contents available information strongly suggests impairment 
the company measures impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans are charged to the allowance when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts  and collateral position  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal is not probable 
at december  and  the company s recorded investment in certain loans that were considered to be impaired was million and million  respectively 
for these impaired loans  there were no specific reserves at december  and the average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended december   and  was approximately million  and million  respectively 
generally  no interest is accrued on loans when factors indicate collection of interest is doubtful or when principal or interest payments become days past due  unless collection of principal and interest are anticipated within a reasonable period of time and the loans are well secured 
for such loans  previously accrued but uncollected interest is charged against current earnings  and income is only recognized to the extent payments are subsequently received and collection of the remaining recorded principal balance is considered probable 
for the years ended december    and  interest income recognized on impaired loans was   and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management interest rate sensitivity the principal purpose of asset liability management is to manage the company s sources and uses of funds to maximize net interest income under different interest rate conditions with minimal risk 
a key component of the asset liability management is the measurement of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the volatility in earnings resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  variability in spread relationships  and the mismatch of re pricing intervals between assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity management attempts to maximize earnings growth by minimizing the effects of changing rates  asset and liability mix  and prepayment trends 
the policy of the company is to control the exposure of the company s earnings to changing interest rates by generally maintaining a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral or balanced position 
the board of directors has established guidelines for maintaining the company s earnings risk due to future interest rate changes 
this analysis provides an indication of the company s earnings risk due to future interest rate changes 
at december   the analysis indicated that the earnings risk was within the company s policy guidelines 

table of contents the following table presents interest rate sensitivity and maturity data at december  the interest rate gaps reported in the table arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different re pricing intervals 
since these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company s interest rate view in subsequent periods 
active management dictates that longer term economic views are balanced against the prospects of short term interest rate changes in all re pricing intervals

other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the company relies on loan reviews  prudent loan underwriting standards and an adequate allowance for credit losses to mitigate credit risk 

table of contents interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s gap position see asset liability management interest rate sensitivity and sensitivity to interest rate risk by subjecting the company s balance sheet to hypothetical interest rate shocks 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability position to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
rate shock is an instantaneous and complete adjustment in market rates of various magnitudes on a static or level balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the company s net interest income for the succeeding months  and the fair values of financial instruments 
the company utilizes asset liability modeling software to determine the effect of a shift in market interest rates  with scenarios of interest rates increasing and decreasing and basis points 
the model utilized to create the table presented below is based on the concept that all rates do not move by the same amount or at the same time 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table 
the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled payments on the adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase due to adjustments in the amount of the payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the gaps between assets and liabilities 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change and each category of asset liability  and the amount of any change in the federal funds rate 
local market conditions and the strategy of the company determine the weights for loan and core deposits  while national markets set the other weights 
in addition  a timing factor has been used as fixed rate instruments do not re price immediately  renewals may have different terms than original maturities  and the timing of changes for each type of instrument varies for example  core deposit re pricing usually occurs sometime after a change in the federal funds rate  but variable rate loans re price immediately with changes to the company s prime interest rate 
due to the various assumptions used for this simulation analysis  no assurance can be given that actual results will correspond with projected results 
the following table shows the estimated impact on the bank s net interest income over a time horizon of one year from the base case and the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change in net interest income increase decrease in present value of equity percentage change in present value of equity up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points loans and certificates of deposit represent the majority of interest rate exposure 
historically  savings and interest bearing checking accounts have not re priced in proportion to changes in overall market interest rates 
changes in net interest income can generally be attributed to the balance of loans and certificates of deposit maturing or re pricing 
the change in fair values of financial assets is mainly a result of loans representing of total interest earning assets at december  as a percentage of total loans  million  or approximately  have fixed interest rates  which decline in value during a period of rising interest rates 

table of contents while asset liability models have become a main focus of risk management  the company believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling risk 
the quantitative risk information provided is limited by the parameters established in creating the related models 
therefore  the company uses these models only as a supplement to other risk management tools 
liquidity and cash flows liquidity represents the ability to meet deposit withdrawals and fund loan demand  while retaining the flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities 
the company s primary sources of funds are customer deposits  loan payments  sales of investments  loans or other assets  borrowings and the use of the federal funds market 
as of december   approximately  of the securities portfolio matures within one year  but all securities are classified as available for sale 
the company maintains a borrowing line with the federal home loan bank fhlb limited to of the bank s assets  subject to certain collateral limitations 
the company can utilize the line for long term borrowings or to meet temporary funding needs with overnight advances 
as discussed in borrowings  the company is under a blanket bond collateral agreement 
the company s practice is to pledge certain securities with the fhlb against its borrowing line 
at december   the company had a total fhlb borrowing capacity of million  outstanding advances of  and a million letter of credit requiring collateralization 
the company is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of the parent company s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
we believe that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of the company to meet its ongoing cash obligations  which consist principally of debt service on the million of outstanding junior subordinated debentures 
as of december   the parent company had a million line of credit with a correspondent bank  with no borrowings outstanding at year end 
as disclosed in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash flows from operations was million  principally from earnings 
the total also included net tax refunds of million 
net cash used by investing activities was primarily due to the million increase in loans in net cash from financing activities in was primarily from net deposit growth 
net cash from operations for was million  principally from earnings 
in  cash flows from operations were substantially higher  but were due primarily from mortgage operations discontinued in the first quarter of net cash of million used by investing activities in consisted primarily of million of loan growth  largely offset by proceeds of million from maturities and sales of investment securities  net of investment securities purchased  and million of net cash and cash equivalents acquired in the merger with aea 
cash from financing activities in related primarily to the issuance of million of junior subordinated debentures 
in  net deposit growth provided million of cash  which was offset by the repayment of million of debt assumed in the acquisition of aea 
impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
management believes that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on the ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
management has an asset liability program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 

table of contents the financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires the company to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on the company s results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  occupancy and business development expenses 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the bank s control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions
