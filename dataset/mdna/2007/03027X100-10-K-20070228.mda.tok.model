item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures in our financial statements 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates on page our continuing operations are reported in two business segments rental and management and network development services 
management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit loss as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments 
we define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and accretion  selling  general  administrative and development expense  and impairments  net loss on sale of long lived assets  restructuring and merger related expense 
we define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling  general  administrative and development expense attributable to the segment  excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses 
segment gross margin and segment operating profit loss for the rental and management segment include interest income  tv azteca  net see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
executive overview our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment  which accounted for approximately and of our total revenues and approximately and of our segment operating profit for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases  leasing additional space on our existing towers  acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled 
we continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity 
in addition  we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services 
the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years  with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter 
accordingly  nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of december is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
in addition  most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease 
these contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent  inflation  or a fixed percentage plus inflation 
revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the applicable agreement 
the revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases 
as discussed above  most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts  which typically may not be cancelled or  in some instances  may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee 
accordingly  lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment 
during  tenant leases representing less than of our total revenues were cancelled 
a significant majority of our revenue growth in was attributable to revenue generated from leasing space on the towers and in building systems acquired in connection with our merger with spectrasite  inc in august  we completed our merger with spectrasite  inc  an owner and operator of approximately  
table of contents wireless and broadcast towers and in building systems in the united states 
the merger was approved by our and spectrasite s stockholders on august   and the results of operations of spectrasite have been included in our consolidated results of operations since that date 
during the year ended december  and during the period august  through december   spectrasite contributed total revenues of million and million  respectively  and segment operating profit of million and million  respectively  to our rental and management segment 
our revenue growth in was also attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites 
during  incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between january  and december   was approximately million  which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites  existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites  the effects of straight line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rate changes  offset by lease cancellations 
our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and  to a lesser extent  the location of and available capacity on our existing sites 
this rate  in turn  is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure  the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital  and general economic conditions 
we believe leasing additional space on our existing sites  including the sites acquired in connection with our merger with spectrasite  inc  will contribute the substantial majority of our year over year revenue growth in we also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites 
in addition to the approximately  towers and in building systems acquired in connection with our merger with spectrasite  inc  we constructed or acquired and sites in and  respectively 
because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above  our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition  which affects year over year comparisons 
during  incremental revenue attributable to these sites that were built or acquired between january  and december   was approximately million 
our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance and utilities 
these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate  selling  general  administrative and development expenses  which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling  general  administrative and development expense 
our segment level selling  general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments  such as sales and property management functions 
in general  our segment level selling  general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year 
as a result  leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow 
our profit margin growth is  therefore  directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period

approximately million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to january   other than in connection with the spectrasite merger 
we believe that our rental and management revenue will increase as we continue to utilize existing site capacity 
we anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers 
network development services revenue network development services revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services due to the increased business associated with our significantly larger communications site portfolio  primarily as a result of sites acquired from spectrasite 
as we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business  we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues

stock option review and related matters during the year ended december   we conducted a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting 
in may  we reported that our board of directors had established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic auditors 
in november  the special committee reported to the board of directors regarding its findings  including that  for certain stock option grants  the legal grant dates when all necessary corporate action had been taken differed from the dates previously recorded for financial accounting and tax purposes 
as a result of the special committee s findings  we restated our historical financial statements to  among other things  record charges for stock based compensation expense related to certain option grants and to account for the tax related consequences 
in november  we filed an amendment no 
to our annual report on form k a for the year ended december   an 
table of contents amendment no 
to our quarterly report on form q a for the quarter ended march   and quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended june  and september  to reflect the impact of the restatement on our historical financial statements 
in addition  in february  in response to additional sec guidance  we filed an amendment no 
to our annual report on form k a for the year ended december  in connection with its review of our stock option granting practices  the special committee recommended a remediation plan to the board of directors to address the issues raised by its findings 
in december  we reported that the board of directors approved the remediation plan  which included  among other things  the elimination of any excess benefit received by our current officers and members of the board of directors from options having been granted to them with exercise prices below the fair market value of our class a common stock on the legal grant date  as determined by the special committee 
for outstanding options  this was accomplished by amending each option to increase the exercise price to the fair market value on the legal grant date  without any compensation to the optionholder 
in december  eight of our senior officers and directors amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares  thereby eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately million 
for options that had been exercised  this was accomplished by compensating the company for the amount of the excess benefit received upon exercise  after reduction for any taxes paid by the individual 
in january  five of the company s senior officers surrendered vested in the money options to purchase an aggregate of  shares  thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit of approximately million net of approximately million in taxes paid by such individuals 
in addition  we took similar steps to eliminate any excess benefit received by certain former officers from the grant to them of options with exercise prices below fair market value 
in december and january  two former officers amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares  thereby eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately million  and surrendered vested in the money options to purchase an aggregate of  shares  thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit of approximately million net of taxes paid by such individuals 
as a result of the review of our stock option granting practices  we determined that a number of stock options were granted with exercise prices below the quoted market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant 
under section a of the internal revenue code section a  part of recently enacted tax legislation  options that were granted with exercise prices below the quoted market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and that vest after december  will likely be subject to unfavorable tax consequences that did not apply at the time of grant 
in order to compensate our non executive employees who previously exercised affected options and already incurred taxes and penalties under section a  we made cash payments on behalf of such individuals for these taxes in january for an aggregate of approximately million 
in order to remedy the unfavorable personal tax consequences of section a on holders of outstanding options  we conducted a tender offer in december for the affected options  pursuant to which we offered to amend the affected options to increase the option exercise price to the quoted market price on the revised grant date  and to give the option holders excluding officers and directors a cash payment for the difference in option exercise price between the amended option and the original price 
following completion of the tender offer  in january  we paid an aggregate of approximately million in cash to holders of options that were amended in the tender offer 
as discussed above in item of this annual report under the caption legal proceedings  we have received a letter of informal inquiry from the sec  a subpoena from the office of the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york and an information document request from the irs  each requesting documents and information related to our stock option granting practices 
in addition  we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are defendants in lawsuits related to our stock option granting practices 
in connection with the review of our stock option granting practices  the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings  we have incurred significant legal  accounting and auditing expenses  and we expect that significant legal expenditures will continue to be incurred in the future 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview during the years ended december  and  we improved our financial position by refinancing and repurchasing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness  which increased our flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders 
our significant transactions included the following the redemption  conversion or repurchase of approximately million face amount of our outstanding debt securities using cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities and with respect to conversions of convertible notes  shares of our class a common stock

as of december   we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately billion 
prior to  we incurred indebtedness to fund the acquisition of tower sites and construction of new tower sites  and to fund acquisitions of businesses related to our services and satellite segments 
beginning in  we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities  and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness 
since then  we have sold businesses and assets that did not provide incremental value to our site leasing business  and we have taken steps to refinance our indebtedness  extend maturity dates  lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility 
in addition  since  we have used cash flow from operations to redeem and repurchase outstanding debt 
in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations 
we believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending december  also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations for for information about our outstanding indebtedness  see contractual obligations below 
our debt service obligations as of december  are set forth under uses of cash contractual obligations below  which reflects an aggregate of million of cash payments to be made in this amount includes million related to the repurchase obligations for our notes  due to the noteholders rights to require us to purchase their notes on february  in february  we conducted a tender offer for our outstanding notes  pursuant to which we repurchased an aggregate of principal amount of notes for an aggregate of million 
upon completion of this tender offer  million principal amount of our notes remained outstanding 
accordingly  giving effect to the completion of the tender offer  our remaining debt service obligations for aggregate million 
in  we expect to fund capital expenditures of between and million  principally related to new tower construction  improvements to existing towers and installation of new in building systems 
in addition  we expect to continue to fund our current million stock repurchase program  which is expected to be completed by the end of february  as well as our new stock repurchase program  pursuant to which we intend to purchase up to an additional billion of our class a common stock through february we also may fund additional purchases of our class a common stock  either pursuant to  or supplemental to  our stock repurchase program 
we expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and future financing transactions 
during  we expect that we will raise additional capital to fund stock repurchases  repurchase existing debt and for other general corporate purposes 
as set forth below under sources of cash credit facilities  in february  we secured an additional million of revolving loan commitments under our credit facilities 
during the first half of  we also anticipate raising additional capital through a securitization of the majority of the towers in our spectrasite portfolio 

table of contents uses of cash stock repurchase program 
in november  we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to million of our class a common stock through december on may   we announced that we were temporarily suspending repurchases under the stock repurchase program in light of the uncertainty surrounding the pending review of our stock option granting practices and the related governmental proceedings 
on december   we announced that we were resuming repurchases of our class a common stock

under the program  our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements  and subject to market conditions and other factors 
to facilitate repurchases  we plan to make purchases pursuant to a trading plan under rule b of the exchange act  which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods 
tower maintenance and improvements  tower construction and in building system installation  and tower and land acquisition

interest rate swap agreements 
during the year ended december   we entered into four interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the likely issuance of new fixed rate debt  which we expect to be issued on or before july  the swaps have an aggregate notional amount of million and fixed rates ranging from to  and will be terminated upon issuance of new fixed rate debt 
we have designated these forward starting interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
we are exposed to market risk for decreases in interest rates until termination of the swap and if we fail to issue such new fixed rate debt on or before such date 
as of december   we expect to receive the fair value of these swap agreements of approximately million 
as of december   we would be required to pay approximately million in cash upon settlement of 
table of contents the swaps if a decline of  or approximately basis points  in interest rates were to occur from the fixed rate of the swaps between the issuance date and the settlement date of the swaps 
in february  we also entered into two similar forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million and a weighted average fixed rate of 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts  a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
accordingly  a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies 
in addition  our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing towers 
restrictions under credit facilities 
the american tower and spectrasite credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions including limitations on additional debt  distributions and dividends  guaranties  sales of assets and liens with which the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries must comply 
each credit facility contains the following two financial maintenance tests with which the borrowers under the applicable credit facility must comply a leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda of not greater than to for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries  and an interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to interest expense of not less than to for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries 
as of december   we were in compliance with both of the foregoing financial tests 
any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the american tower credit facility or the spectrasite credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving loans  but would constitute a default  resulting in  among other things  the amounts outstanding  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  becoming immediately due and payable 
the credit facilities allow us to use borrowings for general corporate purposes and  provided certain conditions are met  permit the use of borrowings under the credit facilities and internally generated funds to repurchase our equity securities and repurchase and refinance other indebtedness without additional lender approval 
restrictions under notes indentures 
the indenture governing the terms of the ati notes contains certain covenants which further restrict ati  the sister guarantors as defined and its and their subsidiaries in addition to the restrictions set forth in the american tower credit facility 
these include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt  guarantee debt  pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments 
spectrasite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture for the ati notes and are not subject to such restrictions 
any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default 
specifically  the indenture restricts ati  the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock  other than debt under the american tower credit facility  or renewals  refundings  replacements or refinancings  up to billion 
the indentures governing the terms of our notes and notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply 
these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  guarantee debt  pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments 
spectrasite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our notes and notes and are not subject to such restrictions 
any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default 
specifically  these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or 
table of contents issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than times our adjusted consolidated cash flow 
we are permitted  however  to incur debt under our credit facilities even if we are not in compliance with this ratio  or renewals  refundings  replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities 
if a default occurred under any of our credit facilities or other debt securities  the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated  and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default 
if this were to occur  we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness 
the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facilities agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 
as of december   our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations principal and interest for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately million  million  million  billion  million and billion  respectively 
in addition  as a holding company  we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries  or funds raised through debt and equity offerings  to fund our debt obligations 
although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and the indenture for the ati notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations  such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances 
accordingly  if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations  we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt  and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations  and our ability to refinance such debt obligations  will depend on our future financial performance  which is subject to many factors beyond our control  as outlined above in item a of this annual report under the caption risk factors 
in addition  our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies  which are dependent on our expected financial performance  the liquidity factors discussed above  and the rating agencies outlook for our industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such refinancings or  if such refinancings are completed  that the terms will be commercially reasonable 
capital markets 
our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on  among other things  general economic conditions  conditions of the wireless industry  our financial performance and the state of the capital markets 
in april  the sec declared effective our universal shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to billion of debt and or equity securities 
as of december   we had not conducted any offerings pursuant to this registration statement 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to income taxes  purchase price allocation  asset retirement obligations  stock based compensation  impairment of assets and revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting 
table of contents treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  beginning on page f income taxes 
sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately million  including approximately million attributable to spectrasite  primarily related to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards assumed as of the acquisition date 
the balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to net state deferred tax assets 
we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets  primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards  as we believe that we will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period 
valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability 
approximately million of the spectrasite valuation allowances as of december  will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill if the underlying deferred tax assets are utilized 
we intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses 
in june and october  we filed federal income tax refund claims with the irs relating to the carry back of million of net operating losses generated prior to  of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately million 
based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities  we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims during the year ended december   and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately million  plus interest 
we expect settlement of this matter in the first half of  however  there can be no assurances with respect to the timing of any refund 
because of the uncertainty associated with the claim  we have not recognized any amounts related to interest 
the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state no growth projections based on our current operations 
the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period 
accordingly  the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations  material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period  management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately billion in taxable income from january  to december  if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above  we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 
from time to time  we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in management s estimate of the net realizable value of our pending federal tax refund claims as described above 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december  depending on the resolution of the verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in verestar 
prior to commencement of the 
table of contents bankruptcy proceedings  we had advanced over million to fund verestar s operations 
no income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings 
purchase price allocation 
we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations sfas no 
 which provides that purchase prices be allocated to the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
in the case of tower assets acquired through the purchase of a business  such as our merger with spectrasite  inc  we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition  and the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as residual goodwill 
we completed our merger with spectrasite  inc in august for a total preliminary purchase price of approximately billion  including the fair value of shares of class a common stock issued  the fair value of options and warrants assumed and estimated transaction costs 
as of december  we were in the process of finalizing a third party valuation of spectrasite s property and equipment  intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities 
given the size of the spectrasite transaction  the values of certain assets and liabilities were based on preliminary valuations that were subject to adjustment as additional information on management s estimates and assumptions were obtained and the third party valuation was finalized 
we completed our third party valuation and an analysis of the acquired tenant and ground leases in june  which formed the basis for determining the cash flows used to value the customer intangible assets acquired and the estimated useful lives of the acquired assets 
the final allocation of the purchase price resulted in changes to the fair values of certain assets and liabilities disclosed in our annual report on form k a for the year ended december   as follows a decrease of million in total intangible assets  a decrease of million in total tangible assets  a decrease of million in the net deferred income tax liability  an increase of million in other liabilities  and a corresponding increase of million in goodwill 
we accounted for the difference between the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with the preliminary and final allocation of the purchase price as a change in accounting estimate under sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
the impact of this change in estimate was accounted for prospectively and was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   nor will it be material to future periods 
asset retirement obligations 
we comply with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
and the provisions of fin no 
both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs  principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located 
under these accounting principles  we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred  if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made  and we accrete such liability through the obligation s estimated settlement date 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
as of december  and  we updated our assumptions used in estimating the company s aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net decrease increase in the estimated obligation of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we also adopted the provisions of fin no 
and recognized a million charge net of an million tax benefit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  this adoption also increased our aggregate asset retirement obligation by approximately million to million as of december  and resulted in an increase to tower assets included in property and equipment  net of million 
the adoption of fin no 
primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions  as fin no 
precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our 
table of contents settlement date assumptions 
fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows  and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense 
the significant assumptions used in estimating the company s aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals  cost of tower removals  timing and number of land lease renewals  expected inflation rates  and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate 
while we feel the assumptions are appropriate  there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates 
we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans 
sfas no 
r supersedes the company s previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under sfas no 
r  we are no longer permitted to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
described below 
instead  we are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share based payments in the statement of operations 
we adopted sfas no 
r under the modified prospective method  pursuant to which compensation expense for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of sfas no 
r 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r primarily resulted in a change in our method of measuring and recognizing the fair value of option awards and estimating forfeitures for all unvested awards 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize stock based compensation awards granted to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of the stock option is determined using an black scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the pro forma compensation expense 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of the stock option is determined in the same manner as the pro forma compensation cost under sfas no 
described below and adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
under apb no 
 the company previously recorded the impact of forfeitures as they occurred 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fas r 
effective upon issuance  this fsp describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no

during the year ended december   we elected the long method  as defined in the fas r in addition  in accordance with sfas no 
r  sfas no 
and eitf topic d  intraperiod tax allocation of the tax effect of pretax income from continuing operations  we have elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently 
table of contents available to us 
we measure the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates 
prior to january   we measured compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb no 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense associated with fixed awards is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the accounting measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is measured as of the date an award has received approval by relevant authority  the number of shares and exercise price are fixed and allocation to specific individuals has occurred 
generally  this occurs on the date the grant is approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors  or  if grant authority has been delegated to management  when the shares are allocated to specific individuals 
the stock based compensation expense for an award is recognized over the vesting period using the ratable method  whereby an equal amount of expense is recognized for each year of vesting 
the actual accounting measurement dates determined in the course of our recent review of our stock option granting practices are based on a review of supporting approval documentation and other extrinsic evidence of awards 
while our financial statements for the years ended december  and have used the above measure  sfas no 
also historically required that we present in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements pro forma financial results as if a fair value method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument were applied 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of the stock option is determined using the black scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the disclosure of pro forma compensation expense 
during the year ended december   we re evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and related disclosure of pro forma expense 
as a result  we lowered our expected volatility assumption for options granted after july  to approximately and increased the expected life of option grants to years using the simplified method permitted by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no

we made this change based on a number of factors  including our execution of our strategic plans to sell non core businesses  reduce leverage and our merger with spectrasite 
we had previously based our volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception  which included periods when our capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future 
our estimate of future volatility is based on our consideration of all available information  including historical volatility  implied volatility of publicly traded options  our current capital structure and our publicly announced future business plans 
impairment of assets 
assets subject to depreciation and amortization and non core long lived assets held for sale we review long lived assets  including intangibles  for impairment whenever events  changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases 
we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows  or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset s fair market value as compared to its carrying value 
we record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment 
we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management s best estimate 
table of contents of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition 
we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 
goodwill assets not subject to amortization we perform our annual goodwill impairment test on december of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in december  and  we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information  changes to which could affect those fair value estimates 
our december and annual impairment testing included approximately billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with spectrasite  inc revenue recognition 
rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned  regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts 
fixed escalation clauses present in non cancelable lease agreements  excluding those tied to the consumer price index cpi or other inflation based indices  and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable leases 
straight line revenues for the years ended december   and approximated million  million and million  respectively 
amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases 
amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete

the information contained in note to our consolidated financial statements is also presented to address certain reporting requirements contained in the indenture for our ati notes 
the indentures governing the notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply 
these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  guarantee debt  pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments 
any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default  which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding notes 
in order for the holders of the notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants  the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the sec our tower cash flow  adjusted consolidated cash flow and non tower cash flow each as defined in the indentures 
under the indentures  our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of adjusted consolidated cash flow that we generate  which is determined based on our tower cash flow and non tower cash flow 
in addition  the indentures for the notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than times our adjusted consolidated cash flow 
as of december   the ratio of our consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated cash flow was approximately for more information about the restrictions under our notes indentures  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources factors affecting sources of liquidity

these financial metrics do not include the results of spectrasite or its subsidiaries because such entities are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for the notes
