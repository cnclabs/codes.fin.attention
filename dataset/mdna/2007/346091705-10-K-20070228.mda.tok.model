the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview forest is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of natural gas and liquids primarily in north america 
forest was incorporated in new york in  as the successor to a company formed in  and has been a publicly held company since we conduct our operations in three geographical segments and five business units 
the geographical segments are the united states  canada and international 
the business units are the western united states western  southern united states southern  alaska  canada and international 
we conduct exploration and development activities in each of our geographical segments  however  all of our estimated proved reserves and producing properties are located in north america 
while discoveries of oil and gas have been made in our international business unit  no proven reserves have been recorded to date 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves were in the united states and approximately were in canada 
forest s total estimated proved reserves as of december  were  bcfe 
recent developments pending acquisition of houston exploration on january   forest announced it had entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which the houston exploration company houston exploration will merge with and into forest in a stock and cash transaction totaling approximately billion plus the assumption of debt 
houston exploration is an independent natural gas and oil producer engaged in the exploration  development  exploitation and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves in north america with operations in the following four producing areas in the united states south texas  east texas  the arkoma basin of arkansas  and the uinta and dj basins in the rocky mountains 
the boards of directors of forest and houston exploration have each unanimously approved the transaction 
the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions  as well as both forest shareholder and houston exploration stockholder approvals 
forest management and its board of directors will continue in their current positions with forest following the completion of the merger 
the merger is expected to close in the second quarter of under the terms of the merger agreement  houston exploration stockholders are to receive total consideration equal to shares of forest common stock and in cash for each share of houston exploration common stock outstanding 
this represents estimated merger consideration of million shares of forest common stock and cash of approximately million  or per share  to be received by the houston exploration stockholders based on the closing price of forest s common stock on january  and the number of shares of houston exploration common stock outstanding on january  and subject to increase in the event that any additional shares of houston exploration common stock are issued prior to the merger closing date in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement 
the actual amount of total cash and stock consideration to be received by each houston exploration stockholder will be determined by elections  an equalization formula and a proration procedure 
it is anticipated that the transaction will be tax free to houston exploration and the stock portion of the consideration will be received tax free by its stockholders 
the cash component of the acquisition is expected to be financed under an amended and restated revolving credit facility of up to billion for which jpmorgan chase bank  na has provided us a commitment letter 
highlights spin off of offshore gulf of mexico operations on march   forest completed the spin off of its offshore gulf of mexico operations by means of a stock dividend  which consisted of a pro rata spin off the spin off of all outstanding shares of forest energy resources  inc hereinafter known as mariner energy resources  inc or meri  a total of  shares of common stock  to holders of record of forest common stock as of the close of business on february  immediately following the spin off  meri was merged with a subsidiary of mariner energy  inc mariner the merger 
mariner s common stock commenced trading on the new york stock exchange on march  the spin off was completed without the payment of consideration by forest shareholders and consisted of a special dividend of shares of meri for each outstanding share of forest common stock 
in the merger  forest shareholders received one share of mariner common stock for each whole share of meri that they held 
the spin off was a tax free transaction for federal income tax purposes 
cotton valley acquisition on march   forest completed the acquisition of oil and gas properties located primarily in the cotton valley trend in east texas 
forest paid approximately million  as adjusted to reflect an economic effective date of february   for properties with an estimated bcfe of estimated proved reserves at the time the acquisition was announced in february and production that averaged mmcfe per day in january forest obtained approximately  net acres in the fields  of which approximately  net acres were undeveloped 
this acquisition provided another core area of growth and added significant onshore activity to the southern business unit 
forest funded this acquisition utilizing its bank credit facilities 
formation of new alaska subsidiaries and related financing as of october   forest transferred the majority of the assets associated with its alaska business unit to a new subsidiary  forest alaska operating llc forest alaska  which is indirectly owned by forest through another subsidiary  forest alaska holding llc 
forest alaska holds the oil and gas interests of forest in the cook inlet region of the state of alaska and entered into a service agreement with forest for the operation of those assets 
the activities of forest alaska are intended to focus on the exploitation of its assets and the proposed development of the mcarthur river field over the next several years 
the new subsidiary obtained million of term loan financing to fund a million distribution to forest and provide initial working capital for forest alaska s operations 
the term loans are secured by substantially all of the subsidiary s assets and are non recourse to forest 
concurrent with the announcement of the pending houston exploration merger  we announced that we intend to sell the alaska business unit in order to reduce indebtedness associated with the pending merger of houston exploration 
operational highlights highlights of forest s operations were as follows forest s year end estimated proved reserves were  bcfe  nearly equal to s year end estimated proved reserves of  bcfe  notwithstanding bcfe of production in and the bcfe of estimated proved reserves distributed to our shareholders in connection with the spin off of our offshore gulf of mexico operations 
oil and gas production in from the retained properties see definition below under results of operations increased to bcfe from bcfe in net income increased to million  or per diluted share  in from million  or per diluted share  in forest had continuing success in with its buffalo wallow project  east texas cotton valley project  and foothills wild river projects in canada 
total drilling well counts for were net wells  with a success rate 
forest invested a total of million to acquire bcfe of estimated proved reserves 
effective august   forest took over as operator of the katy field 
gross field production increased to mmcfe per day at december  from mmcfe per day achieved through the first six months of the year 
outlook in  we expect to continue our development and exploitation activities on our onshore north american assets for which we expect continued production growth 
our capital budget for is million to million  not including capital expenditures planned for the houston exploration assets upon the closing of the proposed merger 
most of this capital budget will be directed to our large drilling programs in buffalo wallow  wild river and east texas 
we also anticipate a continued favorable commodity price environment in in our view  the economic growth and the related increased demand for oil and gas should continue to support historically high commodity prices 
within this environment  we anticipate strong financial performance by forest 
our inventory of exploitation and exploration projects is at a high level  which should provide us good visibility of future production growth 
our plan anticipates cash flow from operations greater than our exploration and development spending levels  which surplus is expected to be used  in whole or in part  to pay down indebtedness and fund acquisitions 
we face numerous challenges in we will be challenged with integrating the operations of the proposed acquisition of houston exploration 
among other matters  we plan to realign staff and responsibilities  and continue to implement effective cost structures 
in addition  we expect our debt to book capitalization ratio to be approximately after the closing of the pending houston exploration acquisition  which is higher than our targeted ratio of to 
we expect to lower the ratio by selling our alaska business unit and certain other non core assets 
we expect to continue to pursue asset acquisition opportunities in  but expect to continue to confront intense competition for these assets 
also  due to a relatively high commodity price environment  we anticipate service costs as well as costs of equipment and raw materials to remain consistent with the levels experienced in our challenge will be to economically add reserves  through drilling and acquisitions  and operate our productive assets in a cost efficient manner that achieves attractive returns for our shareholders 
results of operations as a result of the spin off discussed above  the revenues and expenses associated with our offshore gulf of mexico operations are only included in our consolidated results of operations through february  as a result  the operational results for presented are not comparable to results for as such  revenues and expenses in and that are directly attributable to the properties included in the spin off the spin off properties and those retained the retained properties are discussed separately 
for the year ended december   forest reported net earnings of million or per basic share  an increase compared to net earnings of million or per basic share in the corresponding period 
the increase in net earnings in compared to was primarily due to increases in net unrealized gains on our derivative instruments offset by decreased earnings from operations as a result of the spin off transaction discussed above 
for the year ended december   forest reported net earnings of million or per basic share  a increase compared to net earnings of million or per basic share in the corresponding period 
the increase in earnings in compared to was primarily the result of increased average oil and gas sales prices  offset partially by decreased sales volumes due to production deferrals from the hurricane season and related per unit increases in oil and gas production expense 
discussion of the components of the changes in our annual results follows 
oil and gas sales production volumes  revenues  and weighted average sales prices  by product and location for the years ended december    and are set forth in the table below 
year ended december  gas oil ngls total gas oil ngls total gas oil ngls total mmcf mbbls mbbls mmcfe mmcf mbbls mbbls mmcfe mmcf mbbls mbbls mmcfe production volumes retained properties united states canada total retained properties spin off properties totals revenues in thousands retained properties united states united states hedging effects canada total retained properties spin off properties spin off properties hedging effects total spin off properties totals average sales price retained properties united states united states hedging effects canada total retained properties spin off properties spin off properties hedging effects total spin off properties totals commodity swaps and collars were transacted to hedge the price of spot market volumes against price fluctuations 
see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below concerning our hedging activities 
net oil and gas production from the retained properties in was bcfe or an average of mmcfe per day  a increase from bcfe or an average of mmcfe per day in the net increase in oil and gas production was primarily attributable to increases at the buffalo wallow field and the recently acquired east texas properties in the united states and the wild river field in canada 
oil and natural gas revenues from the retained properties were million in  a increase as compared to million in the increase in oil and natural gas revenues from the retained properties was due to the increase in production and a increase in the average realized sales price per mcfe from in to in oil and gas production from the spin off properties in was bcfe or an average of mmcfe per day through february  compared to bcfe or an average of mmcfe per day in average daily production in was lower than in due to shut in production resulting from hurricanes rita and katrina in the third and fourth quarters of oil and gas revenues from the spin off properties totaled million in resulting in an average price per mcfe of compared to oil and natural gas revenues from the spin off properties of million  or per mcfe in the decrease in total production and total oil and gas revenues was due to the fact that includes only two months of offshore production given the spin off on march  oil and gas sales revenues from all properties increased million in compared to as a result of a increase in price realizations per mcfe partially offset by a decrease in production 
the decrease in our sales volumes between the same periods of bcfe was due primarily to approximately bcfe of deferred production due to hurricanes katrina and rita that primarily impacted our offshore gulf of mexico properties  offset by increases in our onshore north american production 
the average realized sales prices for the periods presented include losses that we recognized on our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges 
for the years ended december   and  forest recognized hedging losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
the recognized losses in include million in hedge losses settled in the fourth quarter of but recognized in the first quarter of to correspond with the timing of the production that was deferred by hurricanes katrina and rita 
see realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments below for information on gains and losses recognized on derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges during the last three years 
oil and gas production expense the table below sets forth the detail of oil and gas production expense for the years ended december    and year ended december  retained properties spin off properties total retained properties spin off properties total retained properties spin off properties total in thousands  except per mcfe data lease operating expenses loe direct operating expense and overhead workover expense hurricane repairs total loe loe per mcfe production and property taxes production and property taxes per mcfe transportation and processing costs transportation and processing costs per mcfe lease operating expenses lease operating expenses for the retained properties increased  or million  to million in from million in however  on a per mcfe basis  loe from the retained properties decreased slightly to per mcfe in from per mcfe in lease operating expenses for the spin off properties were million in compared to million in on a per mcfe basis  loe from the spin off properties increased per mcfe in to per mcfe from per mcfe in primarily due to a relative increase in workover expenses 
lease operating expenses from all properties increased million to in from in on a per unit basis  lease operating expenses increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in due primarily to hurricane activity in the third quarter of that deferred approximately bcfe of production 
as reflected in the table above  direct operating expenses and overhead increased only marginally in compared to while increases in workover costs made up the majority of the million increase in loe 
production and property taxes production and property taxes on the retained properties decreased by or million in as compared to the prior year 
the decrease from the prior year is primarily attributable to severance tax incentives provided in texas  partially offset by higher realized oil and gas revenues and higher assessed property valuations 
production and property taxes incurred on the spin off properties were 
million during compared to million during the decrease in the spin off properties production and property taxes was due to the fact that includes only two months of activity 
the increase in production and property taxes of million from to on all properties was primarily a result of the higher realized oil and gas revenues and higher assessed property valuations 
as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenue  excluding hedging losses  production and property taxes were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in each period is primarily the result of a change in our production mix over the last few years to a higher percentage of onshore production  which is generally subject to production taxes  versus offshore production  which is generally not subject to production taxes 
transportation and processing costs transportation and processing costs for the retained properties were million or 
per mcfe in compared to million or 
per mcfe in the increase of million or 
per mcfe was primarily due to higher transportation and processing costs in canada and alaska 
transportation and processing costs for the spin off properties on a per mcfe basis were 
for compared to 
during the prior year 
transportation and processing costs for all properties were million or 
per mcfe in and million or 
per mcfe in the increase of million or 
per mcfe was due to increases in transportation and processing rates and increases in fuel prices 
general and administrative expense the following table summarizes the components of general and administrative expense and stock based compensation expense incurred during the periods year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe data total general and administrative costs before stock based compensation general and administrative costs capitalized general and administrative expense before stock based compensation general and administrative expense per mcfe total stock based compensation costs stock based compensation costs capitalized stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense per mcfe total general administrative expense including stock based compensation general and administrative expenses the decrease in general and administrative expense before stock based compensation to million in from million in was primarily related to salary and benefit savings related to a reduction in the number of employees subsequent to the spin off as well as a million reduction in our post retiree medical benefit liability caused by a curtailment in the post retiree medical benefit plan also as a result of the spin off 
the increase of million in general and administrative costs in as compared to was primarily related to an increase in salaries and related employee benefit costs caused by our hiring additional employees in conjunction with acquisitions completed in and early and general increases in salaries due to the competitive market for experienced oil and gas professionals 
the percentage of general and administrative costs capitalized remained relatively constant between the three years  ranging between and stock based compensation expense the significant increase in stock based compensation in is due to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under this method of accounting  compensation cost is recorded for all unvested stock options  restricted stock  and phantom stock units beginning in the period of adoption and prior financial statements are not restated 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the awards and is recognized over the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb opinion no 
 no compensation expense was recognized for stock options issued to employees because the grant price equaled or was above the market price on the date of the option grant 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost in the amount of million was recorded during the year ended december  of which approximately million is attributed to a partial settlement of forest s restricted stock awards and phantom stock unit awards in connection with the spin off 
of the million total  million was recorded as compensation expense and million  or  was capitalized to oil and gas properties in accordance with the full cost method of accounting 
depreciation and depletion  undeveloped properties year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe amounts depreciation and depletion expense depreciation and depletion expense per mcfe depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense dd a in was million compared to million in on an equivalent mcf basis  dd a expense remained consistent at per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in the more significant change between and of 
per mcfe was due primarily to higher anticipated drilling and completion costs on future development activities in as well as the effect of property divestitures in canada in late the following costs of undeveloped properties were not subject to depletion at the periods indicated december  united states canada international total in thousands the decrease in the total undeveloped properties of million in from was due primarily to the spin off transaction noted above offset by property acquisitions completed during  including the cotton valley assets in east texas 
the increase in the total undeveloped properties in from was due primarily to the additional undeveloped properties acquired in in conjunction with the buffalo wallow acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the cotton valley and buffalo wallow acquisitions 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion expense of approximately million in  and million in both and was related to the accretion of forest s asset retirement obligations pursuant to sfas no 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the significant decrease in is attributable to the large reduction in future abandonment liabilities associated with the spin off on march   discussed above 
international impairments forest recorded impairments related to its international properties of million in with recorded during the second quarter of related to a dry hole drilled in gabon and million recorded during the fourth quarter of related to expired concessions in italy 
in  forest recorded an impairment of million related to certain international properties  principally related to its leaseholds in romania 
the romania impairment was recorded in the first quarter of in connection with our decision to exit the country as we rationalized our international assets to concentrate on fewer areas 
in  forest recorded impairments of international oil and gas properties of million related to evaluations of projects in albania  germany  and italy 
interest expense interest expense of million in was greater than in  primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances 
interest expense of million in was greater than million in  due primarily to higher average debt balances 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments are primarily related to various derivatives that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting either at their inception  or where hedge accounting was discontinued during their term 
when the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are not met or when cash flow hedge accounting is not elected  realized gains and losses ie  cash settlements are recorded under other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
similarly  changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in contrast  cash settlements for derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded as additions to or reductions of oil and gas revenues while changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
because a significant portion of our derivatives no longer qualified for hedge accounting and to increase clarity in our financial statements  forest elected to discontinue hedge accounting for all of its remaining commodity derivatives beginning in march subsequent to march  forest has recognized mark to market gains and losses in earnings  rather than deferring such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income included in shareholders equity 
this change in reporting has had no impact on forest s reported cash flows  although results of operations have been affected by mark to market gains and losses  which fluctuate with volatile oil and gas prices 
the table below sets forth realized and unrealized gains and losses principally related to our derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting or where hedge accounting was not elected for the periods indicated  which were recorded under other income and expense year ended december  in thousands realized losses gains unrealized gains losses total for comparative purposes  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  realized losses on derivative instruments that met the criteria for hedge accounting  which were recorded as reductions of oil and gas revenues

income tax expense the table below sets forth forest s total income tax expense from continuing operations and effective tax rates for the periods presented year ended december  in thousands  except percentages income tax expense effective tax rate the decrease in our effective tax rate in to from in  was due to a reduction in income taxes of approximately million related to statutory rate reductions enacted in canada and changes in the texas income tax law  net of tax increases of million related to the effects of the spin off of our offshore gulf of mexico operations which includes the tax effects of non deductible spin off costs and an increase in forest s combined state income tax rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our income taxes at the statutory rate to income taxes at our effective rate for each period presented 
results of discontinued operations on march   the assets and business operations of our canadian marketing subsidiary were sold to cinergy canada  inc cinergy for million cdn 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  cinergy will market natural gas on behalf of canadian forest for five years through february unless subject to prior contractual commitment  and will also administer the netback pool that we formerly administered 
we could receive additional contingent payments related to this sale over the next three years if cinergy meets certain earnings goals with respect to the acquired business 
during the year ended december   forest recognized an additional million contingent payment million net of tax due under the agreement  which has been reflected as income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
during  forest did not record a gain or loss from the sale of discontinued operations 
in  forest recorded a 
million loss on discontinued operations  net of tax which included marketing income  general and administrative expenses  deferred income tax expense and other income and expense items 
the subsidiary s results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all years presented 
liquidity and capital resources in  as in  we expect our cash flow from operations to be our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than large acquisitions 
any remaining cash flow from operations will be available for acquisitions  in whole or in part  or other corporate purposes  including the repayment of indebtedness 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production have a significant impact on operating cash flows 
while significant price declines in would adversely affect the amount of cash flow generated from operations  we utilize a hedging program to partially mitigate that risk 
as of february   forest has hedged approximately bcfe of its production 
this level of hedging provides some certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a portion of our expected production 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
for further information concerning our hedging contracts  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging program  below 
our million revolving bank credit facilities  which we entered into in september  provide another source of liquidity 
these credit facilities  which mature in september  are used to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions in the united states and canada as needed 
at january   we had approximately million of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the bank credit facilities  and an unused borrowing base of million 
we intend to amend and restate these credit facilities in connection with our proposed merger with houston exploration as described below under bank credit facilities 
the public capital markets have been our principal source of funds to finance large acquisitions 
we have sold debt and equity securities in both public and private offerings in the past  and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions 
in july  we filed a shelf registration statement that allows forest to issue equity and debt securities of up to million  all of which is still available 
nevertheless  ready access to capital on reasonable terms can be impacted by our debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies and are subject to many uncertainties  including restrictions contained in our bank credit facilities and indentures for our senior notes  macroeconomic factors outside of our control  and other risks as explained in part  item a risk factors 
in conjunction with the announcement of the pending acquisition of houston exploration  we also announced our plans to sell our alaska business unit and certain other non core assets  which should provide another source of liquidity in we believe that our available cash  cash provided by operating activities  and funds available under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating  interest  and general and administrative expenses  our capital expenditure budget  and our short term contractual obligations at current levels for the foreseeable future 
bank credit facilities forest currently has credit facilities totaling million  consisting of a million us credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank and a million canadian credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  toronto branch 
the credit facilities mature in september subject to the agreement of forest and the applicable lenders  the size of the credit facilities may be increased by million in the aggregate 
availability under the credit facilities is based either on certain financial covenants included in the credit facilities or on the loan value assigned to forest s oil and gas properties 
if forest s corporate credit rating by moody s is ba or higher and bb or higher by s p  availability under the credit facilities may  at forest s election  be governed by certain financial covenants 
alternatively  if forest s senior unsecured long term debt credit rating is ba or lower by moody s or bb or lower by s p  availability under the credit facilities will be governed by a borrowing base global borrowing base 
currently  the amount available under the credit facilities is determined by the global borrowing base 
effective september   the syndicate of banks approved a global borrowing base of million  however  forest did not elect to change the global borrowing base allocation and the us allocated borrowing base was kept at million and the canadian allocated borrowing base was kept at million 
the determination of the global borrowing base is made by the lenders taking into consideration the estimated value of forest s oil and gas properties in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
this process involves reviewing forest s estimated proved reserves and their valuation 
while the global borrowing base is in effect  it is redetermined semi annually  and the available borrowing amount could be increased or decreased as a result of such redeterminations 
in addition  forest and the lenders each have discretion at any time  but not more often than once during any calendar year  to have the global borrowing base redetermined 
a revision to forest s reserves may prompt such a request on the part of the lenders  which could possibly result in a reduction in the global borrowing base and availability under the credit facilities 
if outstanding borrowings under either of the credit facilities exceed the applicable portion of the global borrowing base  forest would be required to repay the excess amount within a prescribed period 
if we are unable to pay the excess amount  it would cause an event of default 
the credit facilities include terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers  and acquisitions 
the credit facilities also include several financial covenants 
availability  interest rates  security requirements  and other terms of borrowing under the credit facilities will vary based on forest s credit ratings and financial condition  as determined by certain financial tests 
in particular  any time that availability is not determined by the global borrowing base  the amount available and our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is determined by certain financial covenants 
also  even when availability is determined by the global borrowing base  certain financial covenants may affect the amount available and forest s ability to borrow amounts under the credit facilities 
the credit facilities are collateralized by a portion of our assets 
we are required to mortgage  and grant a security interest in  of our consolidated proved oil and gas properties  measured by value 
we have also pledged the stock of several subsidiaries to the lenders to secure the credit facilities 
under certain circumstances  we could be obligated to pledge additional assets as collateral 
if our corporate credit ratings by moody s and s p improve and meet pre established levels  the collateral requirements would not apply and  at our request  the banks would release their liens and security interests on our properties 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the us credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of  and there were outstanding borrowings of million under the canadian credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
we also had used the credit facilities for approximately million in letters of credit  leaving an unused borrowing amount under the global borrowing base of approximately million at december  at january   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the us credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of  and there were outstanding borrowings of million under the canadian credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
we also had used the credit facilities for approximately million in letters of credit  leaving an unused borrowing amount under the global borrowing base of approximately million 
on january   forest  jp morgan securities inc and jpmorgan chase bank  na entered into a commitment letter and fee letter with respect to the financing of the merger with houston exploration and the related transactions and the refinancing of certain of forest s existing debt 
the commitment letter  which is subject to customary conditions  provides for a commitment of an aggregate of up to billion in financing under a five year amended and restated revolving credit facility 
initially  we anticipate the commitments for the amended and restated us and canadian credit facilities will consist of a us facility of up to billion and a canadian facility of up to million 
we expect the terms of the amended and restated credit facilities to be substantially similar to those of the existing credit facilities 
we expect to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration  which is expected to be approximately million in cash based on the outstanding shares of houston exploration common stock on january  and subject to increase  through borrowings under these amended and restated credit facilities 
forest also expects to use these credit facilities to pay for related merger costs and expenses and for general corporate purposes following the merger 
the commitment letter expires april  and is subject to customary closing conditions 
term loan financing agreement on december   forest  through its wholly owned subsidiaries forest alaska and forest alaska holding llc forest holding  issued  on a non recourse basis to forest  term loan financing facilities in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the issuance was comprised of two term loan facilities  including a million first lien credit agreement and a million second lien credit agreement together the credit agreements 
the loan proceeds were used to fund a million distribution to forest  which forest used to pay down its us credit facility  and to provide forest alaska working capital for its operations and pay transaction fees and expenses 
interest on the loans are based on an adjusted libo rate libor libor plus under the first lien credit agreement and libor plus under the second lien credit agreement or on a rate based on the federal funds rate federal funds rate plus under the first lien credit agreement and federal funds rate plus under the second lien credit agreement  at the election of forest alaska 
the loans under the first lien agreement will become due on december  and the loans under the second lien agreement will become due on december  the term loans are secured by substantially all of the subsidiary s assets 
partial repayments on the loans outstanding under the first lien agreement are due at the end of each calendar quarter  while the loans under the second lien agreement are scheduled for repayment on the maturity date 
in addition  forest alaska is obligated to make mandatory prepayments annually using its excess cash flow and the proceeds associated with certain equity issuances  asset sales  and incurrence of additional indebtedness 
under certain circumstances involving a change in control involving forest holding or forest alaska  the credit agreements also require forest alaska to offer to repurchase outstanding loans and purchase loans put to it by the lenders and  depending on the date of any such repurchase  the repurchase price may include a premium 
upon an event of default  a majority of the lenders under each of the credit agreements may request the agent to declare the loans immediately payable 
under certain circumstances involving insolvency  the loans will automatically become immediately due and payable 
the credit agreements include terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities that may be conducted by forest alaska and forest holding 
the terms include restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  investments  hedging activities  acquisitions  dividends  mergers  sales of assets  transactions with affiliates  and capital expenditures 
in addition  the credit agreements include financial covenants addressing limitations on present value to total debt and first lien debt  interest coverage and leverage ratios 
credit ratings our senior notes are separately rated by two ratings agencies moody s and s p 
in addition  moody s and s p have assigned forest a general corporate credit rating 
from time to time  our assigned credit ratings may change 
in assigning ratings  the ratings agencies evaluate a number of factors  such as our industry segment  volatility of our industry segment  the geographical mix and diversity of our asset portfolio  the allocation of properties and exploration and drilling activities among short lived and longer lived properties  the need and ability to replace reserves  our cost structure  our debt and capital structure and our general financial condition and prospects 
our bank credit facilities include conditions that are linked to our credit ratings 
the fees and interest rates on our commitments and loans  as well as our collateral obligations  are affected by our credit ratings 
the indentures governing our senior notes do not include adverse triggers that are tied to our credit ratings 
the indentures include terms that will allow us greater flexibility if our credit ratings improve to investment grade and other tests have been satisfied 
in this event  we would have no further obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants contained in the indentures 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of any financing activities may be affected by our credit rating at the time any such activities are conducted 
if we consummate the merger with houston exploration as planned  we expect the terms of the amended and restated credit facilities to be substantially similar to those of the existing credit facilities

the net proceeds from the offering were used to fund a portion of the wiser oil company wiser acquisition 
in july  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due  at of par for proceeds of million net of related offering costs 
the net proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our us credit facility 
in july  we redeemed  at of par value  million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes due that were issued by wiser 
the note redemption was funded using borrowings under our us credit facility 
capital expenditures expenditures for property acquisitions  exploration  and development were as follows year ended december  in thousands property acquisitions proved properties undeveloped properties exploration direct costs overhead capitalized development direct costs overhead capitalized total capital expenditures total capital expenditures include both cash expenditures and accrued expenditures 
in addition  property acquisitions include a gross up for deferred income taxes of approximately million in and million in and excludes goodwill recorded in connection with business combinations of approximately million in and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for the allocation of purchase consideration for the larger acquisitions completed in   and does not include estimated discounted asset retirement obligations of million  million  and million related to assets placed in service during the years ended december    and includes million of capital expenditures related to offshore gulf of mexico operations from january  through the date of the spin off on march  capital expenditures related to offshore gulf of mexico operations for consist of 
million for property acquisitions  million for exploration  and million for development 
forest s anticipated expenditures for exploration and development in are estimated to range from million to million 
some of the factors impacting the level of capital expenditures in include crude oil and natural gas prices  the volatility in these prices  the cost and availability of the oil field services  and weather disruptions 
these expenditures will also increase if the proposed merger with houston exploration is consummated 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  after total in thousands bank debt term loans senior notes operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other liabilities derivative liabilities approved capital projects total contractual obligations bank debt consists of commitments related to our united states and canadian credit facilities and anticipated interest payments due under the terms of the credit facilities using the average interest rate in effect at december  term loans consists of the principal obligations on our term loans and anticipated interest payments due on each using the interest rates in effect at december  senior notes consist of the principal obligations on our senior notes and anticipated interest payments due on each 
consists primarily of leases for office space and leases for well equipment rentals 
consists primarily of firm commitments for drilling  gathering  processing  and pipeline capacity 
other liabilities represent current and noncurrent liabilities that are comprised of benefit obligations and asset retirement obligations  for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations 
derivative liabilities represent the fair value of liabilities for oil and gas commodity derivatives as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown  because they are subject to continuing market risk 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions  below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments 
consists of our net share of budgeted expenditures under authorizations for expenditure afe that were approved by us and our joint venture partners as of december  includes afes for which forest is the operator as well as those operated by others 
in addition to the above commitments  we are obligated to make approximately million of capital expenditures over the next three years pursuant to the terms of foreign concession arrangements 
forest also makes delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling or production of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our total maximum commitment under these leases  through totaled approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include i undrawn letters of credit  ii operating lease agreements  iii drilling commitments  and iv contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and gas transportation commitments 
forest does not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
other obligations we hold a equity interest in an affiliate that owns a petroleum pipeline system within the cook inlet area of alaska 
in our capacity as a shareholder  we have agreed to fund our proportionate share of the operating costs and expenses of this affiliate 
we may have contingent obligations in the event the affiliate experiences cash deficiencies 
in addition  we may have other contingent obligations if the affiliate is unable to meet its indemnification requirements or its obligations to the operator of the pipeline 
we are unable to predict or quantify the amount of these obligations  although we have obtained insurance to mitigate the impacts of certain possible outcomes 
surety bonds in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies 
as of february   we had obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain of our operations in the united states and canada in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
see part i  item business regulation for further information 
critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions oil and gas reserve estimates our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production  and property taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling test limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
reference should be made to independent audit of reserves under part i  item business  and risk factors relating to forest estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise  under part i  item a risk factors  in this form k 
accounting for oil and gas derivatives instruments the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires the accounting recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
under the provisions of sfas  the company may or may not elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge against changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability a fair value hedge or against exposure to variability in expected future cash flows a cash flow hedge 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedge as noted above 
changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  to the extent the hedge is effective  have no effect on the statement of operations due to the fact that changes in fair value of the derivative offsets changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
where hedge accounting is not elected or if a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as other income or expense 
as a result of production deferrals experienced in the gulf of mexico related to hurricanes katrina and rita  forest was required to discontinue cash flow hedge accounting on some of its natural gas and oil hedges during the third and fourth quarters of additionally  as a result of the spin off on march   additional commodity swaps and collars formerly designated as cash flow hedges of offshore gulf of mexico production also no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
because a significant portion of the company s derivatives no longer qualified for hedge accounting and to increase clarity in its financial statements  the company elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for all of its remaining commodity derivatives beginning in march accordingly  after march  all changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments have been and will continue to be recognized as other income or expense 
the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
these values are based upon  among other things  future prices  volatility  time to maturity  and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions  or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  the fair values of our derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations in estimated fair value from period to period 
for example  a hypothetical increase in the forward oil and natural gas prices used to calculate the fair value of the derivative instruments at december  of per barrel and 
per mmbtu  respectively  would change the fair values of our derivative instruments at december  by approximately million 
it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue 
actual gains or losses recognized in conjunction with our commodity derivative contracts will likely differ from those estimated at december  and will depend exclusively on the price of the commodities on the specified settlement dates provided by the derivative contracts 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax assets and liabilities are generally determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values of book assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in operations in the period in which the change is enacted 
the book value of income tax assets is limited to the amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
in assessing the value of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income during the periods in which related temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets will reverse  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during relevant periods are reduced 
asset retirement obligations forest has obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore locations at the end of the oil and gas production operations 
forest s largest concentration of removal and restoration obligations is associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the cook inlet of alaska 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs  or asset retirement obligations  is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments  because most of the obligations are many years in the future  and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
inherent in the calculation of the present value of our asset retirement obligations aro under sfas no 
are numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
full cost method of accounting the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the full cost method and the successful efforts method 
the differences between the two methods can lead to significant variances in the amounts reported in our financial statements 
we have elected to follow the full cost method  which is described below 
under the full cost method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement  and abandonment activities is capitalized  and a corresponding asset retirement obligation liability is recorded 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
changes in estimates of reserves or future development costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
assuming consistent production year over year  our depletion expense will be significantly higher or lower if we significantly decrease or increase our estimates of remaining proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to assess individually the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool  or reported as impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations  as applicable 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed each quarter on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations and the effect of cash flow hedges 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash writedown is required 
a ceiling test impairment could cause forest to record a significant non cash loss for a particular period  however  future dd a expense would be reduced thereafter 
in countries or areas where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs  and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion  and amortization  and the application of the ceiling limitation 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
an impairment of unproved property costs may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishment of drilling rights or other information 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned  and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  exploratory dry holes  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis under the successful efforts method 
impairments are assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
in general  the application of the full cost method of accounting results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to the successful efforts method 
the full cost method is used to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities  because we believe it appropriately reports the costs of our exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil  and natural gas liquids for our own account in the united states and canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
hedging program in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in prices on our revenues  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we make use of an oil and gas hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  we enter into commodity swaps  collars  and other financial instruments with counterparties who  in general  are participants in our credit facilities 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
swaps in a typical commodity swap agreement  we receive the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower than the fixed price 
if the index price is higher  we pay the difference 
by entering into swap agreements  we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis 
as of december   we had entered into the following swaps swaps natural gas nymex hh oil nymex wti bbtu per day weighted average hedged price per mmbtu fair value barrels per day weighted average hedged price per bbl fair value in thousands in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal subsequent to december   forest unwound two oil swap agreements covering  bbl per day in and bbl per day in for total proceeds of million 
collars forest also enters into collar agreements with third parties 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price  and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the ceiling price 
costless collars natural gas nymex hh oil nymex wti bbtu per day weighted average hedged floor and ceiling price per mmbtu fair value barrels per day weighted average hedged floor and ceiling price per bbl fair value in thousands in thousands fiscal basis swaps forest also uses basis swaps in connection with natural gas swaps in order to fix the price differential between the nymex henry hub price and the index price at which the physical gas is sold 
at december   there were basis swaps in place covering bbtu per day in with a fair market value of million 
the fair value of our hedges based on the futures prices quoted on december  was a net asset of approximately million 
the following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of our open derivative contracts during  beginning with the fair value of our commodity contracts on december   plus the increase in fair value during the period and the fair value of commodity contracts included in the spin off  plus the contract losses settled and recognized during the period 
fair value of derivative contracts in thousands as of december  net increase in fair value fair value of derivatives transferred in spin off net contract losses recognized as of december  in january and february  we entered into four additional swap agreements and one additional collar agreement to hedge a portion of expected future production attributable to the pending acquisition of houston exploration as summarized in the table below 
natural gas nymex hh swaps collars bbtu per day weighted average hedged price per mmbtu bbtu per day weighted average hedged floor and ceiling price per mmbtu april december fiscal long term sales contracts a portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold in a joint venture with other producers the canadian netback pool 
the canadian netback pool s resale markets are comprised of market based and fixed price contracts 
canadian forest s contractual obligation to deliver natural gas production volumes to these contracts extends through canadian forest s average daily production sold through the canadian netback pool represented approximately of forest s total average daily production in canadian forest supplied of the canadian netback pool sales quantity in  and it is estimated that canadian forest will supply of the canadian netback pool quantity in the contract year 
we expect that canadian forest s pro rata obligations as a gas producer will increase in and future years 
in  the weighted average price paid under the resale contracts was approximately of market value based on the average closing aeco prices during to the extent the canadian netback pool s supply is insufficient to meet the delivery obligations under the resale contracts  as is currently the case  the canadian netback pool must make up the shortfall by purchasing spot market gas at prices that currently exceed the prices paid under the resale contracts 
this shortfall could increase if individual producers were to default on their supply obligations owed to the canadian netback pool 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in several foreign currencies and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing  and investing transactions 
in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by forest outside of north america have been primarily united states dollar denominated  as have cash proceeds related to property sales and farmout arrangements 
substantially all of our canadian revenues and costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to the us dollar  we believe that any currency risk associated with our canadian operations would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
interest rate risk the following table presents principal amounts and related interest rates by year of maturity for forest s debt obligations at december  total fair value dollar amounts in thousands bank credit facilities variable rate average interest rate term loans variable rate average interest rate total variable rate debt variable rate average interest rate long term debt fixed rate coupon interest rate effective interest rate as of december  the effective interest rate on the senior notes due  the senior notes due  and the senior notes due is reduced from the coupon rate as a result of amortization of gains related to the termination of related interest rate swaps
