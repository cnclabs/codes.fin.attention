overview we are a leading designer  producer and brand manager of innovative  high quality footwear and the category creator in the sport sandal  luxury sheepskin  and sustainable footwear segments 
we market our products under three proprietary brands teva high performance sport sandals and rugged outdoor footwear  
table of contents ugg authentic luxury sheepskin boots and a full line of luxury and comfort footwear  and simple innovative sustainable lifestyle footwear and accessories 
we sell our three brands through our quality domestic retailers and international distributors and directly to our end user consumers through our consumer direct business 
we sell our footwear in both the domestic market and the international markets 
independent third parties manufacture all of our footwear 
our business has been impacted by several important trends affecting our end markets the markets for casual  outdoor and athletic footwear have grown significantly during the last decade 
we believe this growth is a result of the trend toward casual dress in the workplace  increasingly active outdoor lifestyles and a growing emphasis on comfort 
consumers are more often seeking footwear designed to address a broader array of activities with the same quality  comfort and high performance attributes they have come to expect from traditional athletic footwear 
our customers have narrowed their footwear product breadth  focusing on brands with a rich heritage and authenticity as market category creators and leaders 
consumers have become increasingly focused on luxury and comfort  seeking out products and brands that are fashionable while still comfortable 
by emphasizing our brand image and our focus on comfort  performance and authenticity  we believe we can better maintain a loyal consumer following that is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by changing fashions and changes in consumer preferences 
below is an overview of the various components of our business  including some of the important factors that affect each business and some of our strategies for growing each business 
teva brand overview we initially produced teva products under a license from the inventor of the teva universal strap technology  mark thatcher 
in november  we purchased from mr 
thatcher the teva worldwide assets  including the teva internet and catalog business and all patents  trade names  trademarks and other intellectual property associated with the acquired teva assets  which we refer to collectively as the teva rights 
from fiscal to  wholesale net sales of teva brand products increased at a compound annual growth rate of 
however  for fiscal years and  wholesale net sales of teva products decreased by approximately and  respectively  compared to the year ago periods 
we attribute this decline in sales primarily to a prolonged period of weak product innovation  coupled with a significant increase in competitor activity 
we began to address this situation in by dedicating significantly greater resources to product planning  design  and development  and through aggressive marketing 
we also repositioned the teva brand to a younger target consumer 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we had higher full price sales compared to the same periods in for the third and fourth quarters of  the teva brand s wholesale net sales increased by and  respectively  compared to the same periods of we expect teva brand growth to be in the mid teens year over year in we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets as of december  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
however  we concluded that the fair value of our teva brand trademarks was lower than the carrying amount and recorded a  impairment loss in a separate line item within income from operations  and as a part of our teva reportable segment 
despite the slight decrease in sales for  the teva brand sales increased in the fourth quarter of over the fourth quarter in the second half of  steps were taken to reduce our inventory of old teva product 
beginning in the first quarter of  we significantly increased our investment in measurable media advertising and in store display materials 
we shifted the target of our advertising to a younger  trend setting consumer 
we also introduced a modest collection of new styles for both spring and fall as a result  closeout sales represented a significantly smaller percentage of total sales compared to we see a continuing shift in consumer preferences and lifestyles to include more outdoor recreational activities 
the teva brand has remained popular among professional and amateur outdoor enthusiasts  who consider the brand authentic and performance oriented 
our spring product line is over new  and includes 
table of contents innovative technical performance styles  as well as new colors and fresh new casual styles  which target a new generation of young outdoor athletes and enthusiasts 
to further capitalize on the growth of outdoor recreational activities and the acceptance of certain outdoor footwear products for everyday use  we will continue to explore opportunities to broaden the teva brand s distribution with image enhancing retailers beyond our core outdoor specialty and sporting goods channels 
through effective channel management  we believe we can continue to expand into new distribution channels without diluting our outdoor heritage and our appeal to outdoor enthusiasts 
through appropriate channel product line expansion  we continue to broaden our product offerings beyond sport sandals to new products that meet the style and functional needs of our consumers 
ugg brand overview the ugg brand has been a well known brand in california for many years and over the past few years has become a recognized brand throughout the remainder of the country 
over the past few years  our ugg brand has received increased media exposure including increased print media in national ads and co op advertising with our customers  which contributed to broader public awareness of the ugg brand and significantly increased demand for the collection 
we believe that the increased media focus and demand for ugg products was driven by the following consumer brand loyalty  due to the luxury and comfort of ugg footwear  increased marketing in high end magazines  successfully targeting high end distribution  adoption by high profile film and television celebrities as a favored footwear brand  increased media attention that has enabled us to introduce the brand to consumers much faster than we would have normally been able to  continued geographic expansion across the us and internationally  continued addition of new product categories 
we believe the luxury and comfort features of ugg products will continue to drive long term consumer demand 
recognizing that there is a significant fashion element to ugg footwear and that footwear fashions fluctuate  our strategy seeks to prolong the longevity of the brand by offering a broader product line suitable for wear in a variety of climates and occasions and by limiting distribution to selected higher end retailers 
as part of this strategy  we have significantly increased our product line to approximately styles in fall from approximately styles in this product line expansion includes our significantly expanded spring and fall fashion collection and men s offering  as well as new styles in our driving collection  our newly introduced surf collection  our cold weather collection and our luxury slipper category 
nevertheless  we cannot assure investors that ugg brand sales will continue to grow at their recent pace or that revenue from ugg products will not at some point decline 
for the year ended december   the ugg brand s wholesale sales increased compared to the same period in simple overview the simple brand shoes began in as an alternative to all the over built  over priced  and over hyped products in the marketplace 
the brand s foundation was built on the old school sneaker and the new original clog 
in fall  as a response to the massive amount of waste produced by the footwear industry  the simple brand launched a new collection of ecologically friendly footwear called green toe  a product collection that consists of sustainable materials and that we hope will revolutionize the footwear industry 
we have repositioned the brand to be focused on becoming the world leader in sustainable footwear and accessories 
in  we also hired an in house public relations manager  increased our print media campaigns  as well as improved our distribution initiatives through the establishment of dedicated sales representatives in key markets 
these strategies  combined with innovative products and unique marketing  have created strong relationships with our retailers 
it is more apparent now that the brand is dedicated to creating a cohesive and consistent message to both the retailer and consumer 
in  our men s and women s products performed well at retail  as demand continues to increase for our green toe products 
we increased our account base both domestically and internationally 
we also expanded 
table of contents our presence into additional retail stores with our key accounts 
these efforts resulted in an increase of of wholesale net sales of simple brand products for the year ended december   compared to the same period in simple s mission is to be the world leader in sustainable footwear and accessories as we continue to bring fresh product designs to the market and implement our sales strategy to expand distribution channels 
consumer direct overview our consumer direct business includes our internet and catalog retailing operations as well as our retail stores 
we acquired our internet and catalog retailing business in november as part of the acquisition of the teva rights 
in addition  we have opened three new retail outlet stores  one in camarillo  california  one in wrentham  massachusetts and one in riverhead  new york along with our existing store in ventura  california 
we also opened our first ugg brand concept store in new york  new york in based on the success of the existing stores  we currently plan to open one or two additional retail outlet stores in select premium outlet malls in the us  as well as another ugg brand concept store in in a major metropolitan area by the end of our consumer direct business  which today sells all three of our brands  enables us to meet the growing demand for these products  to sell the products at retail prices and to provide us with significant incremental operating income 
from the time we initiated our consumer direct business through the end of  we have had significant revenue growth  much of which occurred as the ugg brand gained popularity and as consumers have continued to increase reliance on the internet for footwear and other purchases and as we began to open retail outlet stores 
net sales of the consumer direct business increased in the year ended december   compared to the same period in managing our internet business requires us to focus on generating internet traffic to our websites  to effectively convert website visits into orders  and to maximize average order sizes 
we distribute approximately two million consumer brochures throughout the year to drive our catalog order business 
we plan to continue to grow this business through improved website features and performance  increased marketing and european websites 
overall  our consumer direct business benefits from the strength of our brands and  as we grow our brands over time  we expect this business to continue to be an important segment of our business 
licensing overview in  we embarked on a strategy to license our footwear brands to complementary products outside of footwear  generally in the apparel and accessories categories 
we currently have nine licensing agreements with six licensees for the teva and ugg brands combined 
we record licensing revenues and expenses within their respective brand 
the activity is very small in relation to the consolidated operations  and we do not expect significant incremental net sales and profits from licensing in the near future 
seasonality our business is seasonal  with the highest percentage of teva brand net sales occurring in the first and second quarters of each year and the highest percentage of ugg brand net sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
to date  the simple brand has not had a seasonal impact on the company 
first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter net sales income from operations first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter net sales income from operations included in income from operations in the fourth quarter of is a  impairment loss on our teva trademark 

table of contents with the dramatic growth in the ugg brand in recent years  combined with the introduction of a fall teva product line  net sales in the last half of the year have exceeded that for the first half of the year 
given our expectations for each of our brands in  we currently expect this trend to continue 
nonetheless  actual results could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product  competition and our customers continuing to carry and promote our various product lines  among other risks and uncertainties

impairment loss 
we conducted our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets using market value approaches and valuation techniques as of december  and concluded that the fair value of our teva brand trademarks was lower than the carrying amount 
therefore  we recognized an impairment loss of  on our teva trademarks in the fourth quarter of income from operations

in  income tax expense was  representing an effective income tax rate of 
in  income tax expense was  representing an effective income tax rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to approximately  of impairment loss attributable to a foreign subsidiary that receives no tax benefit from the charge  as this subsidiary is in a tax free jurisdiction

we present our effective tax rate excluding the impairment loss because such loss is a non recurring charge that is outside our normal business operations 
the numbers are presented in a manner that is consistent with how management views our business 
net income 
our net income decreased from  in to  in primarily as a result of the impairment loss  offset by higher net sales  higher gross profit margins  and higher interest income in our earnings per diluted share decreased from to primarily as a result of the decrease in net income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview

net wholesale sales of teva products decreased by  or  in compared to this decrease was due to several factors including an unseasonably cold spring season  increased competition  a recent lack of meaningful product innovation and a decline in sales in the european market

gross margin was favorably impacted by the elimination of the airfreight costs incurred by the ugg brand in  the lower overhead costs per pair resulting from our leverage of fixed overhead costs over a greater production volume in and the increase in domestic sales  which generally have a higher gross margin than our international sales 
these favorable items were offset by an increase in inventory write downs and closeout sales in combined with an increase in ugg brand sales  which generally carry a lower gross margin than sales of our teva and simple product lines

in addition  in we repatriated  from our international subsidiaries under section of the american jobs creation act of  resulting in approximately of incremental federal and state income taxes 
net income 
our net income increased from  in to  in as a result of higher net sales and lower interest expense in  as discussed above 
our earnings per diluted share increased from to as a result of the increase in net income  which was partially offset by the increase in weighted average common shares outstanding due to the follow on public offering in may off balance sheet arrangements we have two types of off balance sheet arrangements

liquidity and capital resources we finance our working capital and operating needs using a combination of our cash and cash equivalents balances  short term investments  cash generated from operations and the credit availability under our revolving credit facility 
the seasonality of our business requires us to build inventory levels in anticipation of the sales for the coming season 
the teva brand generally begins to build inventory levels beginning in the fourth quarter and first quarter in anticipation of the spring selling season that occurs in the first and second quarters  whereas the ugg brand generally builds its inventories in the second quarter and third quarters to support sales for the fall and winter selling seasons  which historically occur during the third and fourth quarters 
the ugg brand experienced earlier than expected reorders in the third quarter of which  coupled with the positive sell through in the fourth quarter of  contributed to the significant decrease in ugg brand inventory at december  when compared to december  our cash flow cycle includes the purchase of these inventories  the subsequent sale of the inventories and the eventual collection of the resulting accounts receivable 
as a result  our working capital requirements begin when we purchase the inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting receivables 
given the seasonality of our teva and ugg brands  our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
the cash required to fund these working capital fluctuations is generally provided using a combination of our internal cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in was largely due to the higher net income excluding the impairment loss on intangible assets of  the increase was also due to a higher increase in trade accounts payable in versus due to the timing of certain payments

net working capital improved by  to  as of december  from  as of december   primarily as a result of higher short term investments balances and increased accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in trade accounts payable and accrued payroll 
these changes in working capital are primarily due to increased sales and increased bonuses payable as well as our normal seasonality and timing of cash receipts and cash payments 
cash from investing activities

in september  we entered into a purchase obligation with a movie production company for advertising services 
our teva brand is the presenting sponsor of a new documentary imax film that is to be released in imax theaters in march we believe that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under our existing facility  cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our current and foreseeable working capital requirements 
however  risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to maintain our cash position include our growth rate  the continued strength of our brands  our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences  our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  our ability to effectively manage our inventories and the volume of letters of credit used to purchase product  among others 
see part i  item a  risk factors for a discussion of additional factors that may affect our working capital position 
furthermore  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirement  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a new credit facility or draw on our existing facility 
the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in incurring debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
although there are no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of any other businesses  we may  from time to time  evaluate acquisitions of other businesses or brands 
impact of inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowances for estimated returns  discounts  mark downs  and bad debts are provided for when related revenue is recorded 
amounts billed for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of net sales  while the related costs paid to third party shipping companies are recorded as a cost of sales 
we present revenue net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures about contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience  existing  known circumstances  authoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management reasonably could use different 
table of contents estimates and assumptions  and changes in estimates and assumptions could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a potential material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically been accurate in our estimates used for the reserves and allowances below 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged trade accounts receivables  economic conditions  historical experience and the customers credit worthiness 
trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
the reserve includes specific reserves for accounts  which are identified as potentially uncollectible  plus a non specific reserve for the balance of accounts based on our historical loss experience with bad debts 
reserves have been established for all probable losses of this nature 
the gross trade accounts receivable balance was  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was at december   compared to gross trade accounts receivable of  and allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  compared to december  was primarily related to the collection of accounts for which we had previously reserved as doubtful 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by approximately reserve for sales discounts 
a significant portion of our domestic net sales and resulting trade accounts receivable reflects a discount that the customers may take  generally based upon meeting certain order  shipment and payment timelines 
we estimate the amount of the discounts that are expected to be taken against the period end trade accounts receivable and we record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts 
we determine the amount of the reserve for sales discounts considering the amounts of available discounts in the period end accounts receivable aging and historical discount experience  among other factors 
the reserve for sales discounts was approximately  at december  and  at december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in gross trade accounts receivable as of december  compared to december  in addition to a larger volume of pre book sales to customers that were offered higher terms discounts in the fourth quarter of our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example a change in the estimate of the percentage of accounts that will ultimately take their discount would change the reserve for sales discounts at december  by approximately allowance for estimated returns 
we record an allowance for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to period end 
in general  we accept returns for damaged or defective products but discourage returns for other reasons 
we base the amount of the allowance on any approved customer requests for returns  historical returns experience and any recent events that could result in a change in historical returns rates  among other factors 
the allowance for returns was  at december  and  at december  the decrease in the allowance was a result of lower actual return rates in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the reserve for returns at december  by approximately allowance for estimated markdowns 
when our customers pay their invoices  they often take deductions for markdowns against their invoices  which we seldom recover 
therefore  we record an allowance for the balance of markdowns that are outstanding in our accounts receivable balance as of the end of each quarter  along with an estimated reserve for markdowns that have not yet been taken 
this estimate is based on historical trends of the timing of markdowns taken against invoices 
the allowance for markdowns was  at december  and  at december  the slight increase in the allowance was a result of higher gross trade accounts receivables as of december  compared to december   partially offset by faster resolution of these markdowns by our vendor compliance department 
inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review the various items in inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete  and impaired inventory 
in doing so  we write the inventory down to the lower of cost or estimated future net selling prices 
at december   inventories were stated at  
table of contents net of inventory write downs of  at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  the increase in inventory write downs at december  compared to december  was primarily due to larger amounts of closeout inventory on hand for teva and simple 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write down reserve at december  by approximately valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we periodically assess the impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets on a separate asset basis based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets individually 
we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based on the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill or the fair value of the assets for nonamortizable intangibles compared to their respective carrying value 
we consider other long lived assets to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
among other considerations  we consider the following factors the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  our future plans regarding utilization of the assets  any changes in legal ownership of rights to the assets  and changes in consumer demand or acceptance of the related brand names  products or features associated with the assets 
if we determine the assets to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
in addition  as it relates to long lived assets  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on the estimate of the period that the assets will generate sales or otherwise be used by us 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of of  net of the related income tax benefit of in  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets using market value approaches and valuation techniques as of december  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
however  we concluded that the fair value of our trademarks was less than the carrying amount and recorded an impairment charge of  our use of different estimates including estimated royalty rates  discount rates  and future revenues and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in our estimated future revenues of teva would change the impairment loss for the year ended december  by approximately  recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the provisions of fin are effective for us as of january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin  and believe the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas standardizes the definition and approaches for fair value measurements of financial instruments for those standards which already permit or require the use of fair value 
it does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas defines a hierarchy for valuation techniques and also requires additional disclosures 
the provisions of sfas are effective for us as of january  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas provides companies the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this provides companies the opportunity to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by measuring instruments differently without 
table of contents complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the effect this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
although we have used foreign currency hedges in the past  we no longer utilize forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate as all of our purchases and sales for the foreseeable future will be denominated in us currency 
although our sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us currency  our sales and inventory purchases may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in the international markets where our products are sold and manufactured 
if the us dollar strengthens  it may result in increased pricing pressure on our distributors  which may have a negative impact on our net sales and gross margins 
we are unable to estimate the amount of any impact on sales and gross margins attributed to pricing pressures caused by fluctuations in exchange rates 
market risk 
our market risk exposure with respect to financial instruments is to changes in the prime rate in the us and changes in libor 
our revolving line of credit provides for interest on outstanding borrowings at rates tied to the prime rate or at our election tied to libor 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
a increase in interest rates on our current borrowings would have no impact on income before income taxes
