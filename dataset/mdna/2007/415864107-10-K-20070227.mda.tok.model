this segment accounted for of the company s revenues and of the operating income for the engineered products and services all other category s revenues in were million compared with million in  a increase 
operating income increased by to million  from million in four of the five businesses in this category contributed higher revenues in compared with  and three of the businesses contributed higher operating income 
the air cooled heat exchangers business continued to benefit from strong energy market demand due to increased natural gas drilling and transmission 
the industrial grating business again posted improved results due to strong end markets in energy and non residential construction 
the roofing granules and abrasives business and the boiler and process equipment business contributed solid performances in  consistent with the railway track maintenance services and equipment business continued the shift towards contract services  but operating income was negatively impacted by increased operating expenses  mostly from the effects of a rail grinder accident  increased raw material costs and higher sub contractor equipment and labor costs 
however  the overall strong performance by the businesses in this group helped to moderate the rising commodity costs experienced throughout this category in this category accounted for of the company s revenue and of the operating income for the gas technologies segment s revenues in were million compared with million in  a increase 
operating income decreased by to million  from million in operating income was negatively impacted by restructuring costs associated with strategic initiatives including exiting an underperforming product line  as well as higher commodity costs for brass and steel 
these increased costs reduced operating margins for this segment by basis points from in to in this segment accounted for of the company s revenues and of the operating income for the positive effect of foreign currency translation increased consolidated revenues by million and pre tax income by million when compared with outlook overview the company s operations span several industries and products as more fully discussed in part i  item  business 
on a macro basis  the company is affected by worldwide steel mill production and capacity utilization  non residential and commercial construction and industrial maintenance activities  industrial production volume  and the general business trend towards the outsourcing of services 
the overall outlook for continues to be positive for these business drivers 
the company s mill services segment expects to continue to benefit from consistent levels of global steel production at mills served by the company  new contract signings and continued accretion from the december acquisition of bisnh 
however  the company may also experience increased operating costs that could have a negative impact on operating margins  to the extent these costs cannot be passed to customers 
both the domestic and international access services activity remains strong 
although the sale of the youngman light access manufacturing business in late modestly affected revenues  operating income in for the segment was a record and is expected to continue to benefit from the strong performance of hunnebeck  increased non residential construction spending and industrial maintenance activity in the company s major markets  continued development of new markets  further market penetration from new products  product cross selling opportunities among the markets served by the three access services businesses  and cost reduction opportunities through consolidated procurement and continuous process improvement initiatives 
the outlook for the engineered products and services all other category remains positive for income and margins in the company s railway track maintenance services and equipment business are expected to improve in the long term from the shift towards contract services 
the air cooled heat exchangers business is expected to continue to benefit from strong end market demand due to increased natural gas drilling and transmission 
the boiler and process equipment business and the industrial grating products business are expected to post another year of solid  stable results in the roofing granules and abrasives business is expected to continue to perform consistently well long term  although increased operating costs could reduce operating margins 
in january  the company announced its intention to divest the gas technologies business 
this decision is consistent with the company s overall strategic focus on global industrial services businesses 
the divestiture is expected to be completed in the second half of the stable or improved market conditions for most of the company s services and products  the significant investments made recently for acquisitions  such as the february acquisition of excell materials  and other growth related capital expenditures provide the base for achieving the company s stated objective for growth in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities for the record performance and cash flow achieved in and the executed strategic actions provide a solid foundation towards achieving these goals

to the extent that such costs cannot be passed to customers in the future  operating income may be adversely affected 
o total pension expense for increased million compared with defined contribution and multi employer plan expenses for increased approximately million from due to increased volume in the mill services and access services segments 
this was partially offset by decreased defined benefit pension expense of approximately million due principally to improved returns on plan assets in as well as the company s cash contributions to the plans assets 
the company is currently taking additional actions designed to further mitigate pension expense volatility 
this is more fully discussed in the outlook  trends and strategies section

o in  there was a continued strengthening in the north american non residential construction markets that started in the latter half of this had a positive effect on volume particularly equipment rentals which caused overall margins and operating income in north america to improve 
equipment rentals  particularly in the construction sector  provide the highest margins for this segment 
o the international access services business continued to improve due to increased non residential construction spending and industrial maintenance activity in the company s major markets

o the boiler and process equipment business delivered improved results in due to increased revenues from the new generation mach boilers  thermific boilers and process equipment 
o the increase in operating income for the industrial grating products business was due principally to higher pricing and an improved product mix  partially offset by higher raw material costs 
o higher pricing resulting from the pass through of higher energy costs for roofing granules and abrasives again sustained profitable results for that business in  approximating s operating income 
o operating income for the railway track maintenance services and equipment business was lower in compared with due to increased operating expenses  mostly from the effects of a rail grinder accident  increased raw material costs and higher sub contractor equipment and labor costs  partially offset by favorable equipment sales mix and increased repair parts volume

cost savings as a result of this plan helped decrease the impact of significantly increased brass costs in in addition  certain product lines have been rationalized which resulted in significant restructuring costs incurred in o the international businesses  principally in europe  contributed to the improved performance of the cryogenics business during compared with o despite higher demand for industrial cylinders  operating income decreased from due mainly to the effect of equipment repairs and maintenance  product mix and higher commodity and energy related costs 
o operating income decreased for propane tanks in  due to decreased demand  as well as increased commodity costs 
the negative effect of these items was partially offset by a favorable product mix and process improvement initiatives 
o operating income increased during for composite wrapped cylinders due to increased sales and a favorable product mix  partially offset by higher raw material costs 
o foreign currency translation in decreased operating income for this segment by million 
outlook  trends and strategies looking to and beyond  the following significant items  trends and strategies are expected to affect the company company wide o the company will continue its focus on expanding the industrial services businesses  with a particular emphasis on growing the mill services segment  the access services segment and other specialized services 
growth is expected to be achieved through the provision of additional services to existing customers  new contracts in both developed and emerging markets and strategic acquisitions  such as the february acquisition of excell materials  inc additionally  new higher margin service opportunities in railway services will be pursued globally 
o in january  the company announced its intention to divest the gas technologies business 
this decision is consistent with the company s overall strategic focus on industrial services businesses 
o the company will continue to invest in strategic acquisitions and growth capital investments  however  management will be very selective in its capital investments  choosing those with the highest economic value added eva r 
o a greater focus on corporate wide expansion into emerging economies is expected in the coming years 
more specifically  within the next three to five years  a focused strategy of the company is to approximately double its presence in the latin american  asia pacific  middle east and africa  and eastern european markets to approximately of total revenues 
o the continued growth of the chinese steel industry  as well as other asian emerging economies  could impact the company in several ways 
increased steel mill production in china  and in other asian countries  may provide additional service opportunities for the mill services segment 
however  increased asian steel exports could result in lower steel production in other parts of the world  affecting the company s customer base 
additionally  continued increased chinese economic activity may result in increased commodity costs in the future  which may adversely affect the company s manufacturing businesses 
the potential impact of these risks is currently unknown 
o increases in energy and commodity costs eg  fuel  natural gas  steel  brass  aluminum  etc 
and worldwide demand for these commodities could have an adverse effect on the company s raw material costs and ability to obtain the necessary raw materials 
fuel and energy costs increased approximately million in compared with excluding increased costs due to acquisitions 
a portion of this increase was growth related 
should cost increases continue  it could result in reduced operating income for certain products to the extent that such costs cannot be passed on to customers 
the effect of any middle east armed hostilities on the cost of fuel and commodities is currently unknown  but it could have a significant effect 
o the armed hostilities in the middle east could also have a significant effect on the company s operations in the region 
the potential impact of this risk is currently unknown 
this exposure is further discussed in part i  item a  risk factors 
o foreign currency translation had an overall favorable effect on the company s sales  operating income and stockholders equity as a result of translation adjustments during if the us dollar strengthens  particularly in relationship to the euro or british pound sterling  the impact on the company would generally be negative in terms of reduced sales  income and stockholders equity 
o the company expects strong cash flow from operating activities in exceeding the record of million achieved in this will help support the company s growth initiatives 
o controllable cost reductions and continuous process improvement initiatives across the company are targeted to further enhance margins for most businesses 
these initiatives include improved supply chain management  additional outsourcing in the manufacturing businesses  and an added emphasis on corporate wide procurement initiatives 
the company will use its increased size and leverage due to recent acquisitions to reduce vendor costs and focus on additional opportunities for cost reductions via procurement in low cost countries such as china and india 
o total pension expense defined benefit  defined contribution and multi employer for is expected to approximate or be slightly higher than the level 
defined benefit pension expense is expected to decline in due to the significant level of cash contributions  including voluntary cash contributions approximately million during and million during  mostly to the uk plan  which will have a positive effect on future years pension expense  to the defined benefit pension plans as well as the higher than expected returns in on the plans assets 
the company s pension task force continues to evaluate alternative strategies to further mitigate overall pension expense  including the on going evaluation of investment fund managers performance  the balancing of plan assets and liabilities  the risk assessment of all multi employer pension plans  the possible merger of certain plans  the consideration of incremental cash contributions to certain plans  and other changes that should mitigate future volatility and expense 
on a comparative basis  total pension expense during was million higher than  due principally to increased defined contribution and multi employer pension expense resulting from increased volume in the access services and mill services segments 
o changes in worldwide interest rates  particularly in the us and europe  could have a significant effect on the company s overall interest expense  as approximately of the company s borrowings are at variable interest rates as of december  in comparison to approximately at december  
the company manages the mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt to preserve adequate funding flexibility as well as control the effect of interest rate changes on consolidated interest expense 
mill services segment o to maintain pricing levels  a more disciplined steel industry has been adjusting production levels to bring inventories in line with current demand 
based on current market conditions and industry reports  the company expects global steel production to remain stable in  which would generally have a favorable effect on this segment s revenues 
o further consolidation in the global steel industry is probable 
should additional transactions occur involving some of the steel industry s larger companies that are customers of the company  it would result in an increase in concentration of revenues and credit risk for the company 
if a large customer were to experience financial difficulty  or file for bankruptcy protection  it could adversely impact the company s income  cash flows and asset valuations 
as part of its credit risk management practices  the company closely monitors the credit standing and accounts receivable position of its customer base 
further consolidation may also increase pricing pressure on the company and the competitive risk of services contracts which are up for renewal 
conversely  such consolidation may provide additional service opportunities for the company as the company believes it is well positioned competitively 
o energy related costs increased approximately million during compared with excluding increased costs due to acquisitions 
some of these costs were passed on to customers in the form of selling price increases 
given the volatility of such costs  the future effect on the company cannot be quantified 
o the company has been placing significant emphasis on improving operating margins of this segment 
margin improvements are most likely to be achieved through internal efforts such as global procurement initiatives  process improvement programs  maintenance best practices programs  and continued execution of the company s reorganization plan 
access services segment o both the international and domestic access services businesses experienced buoyant markets during and that is expected to continue in specifically  international and especially north american non residential construction activity continues at historically high volume levels 
additionally  new product line additions continue to benefit growth in north america 
engineered products and services all other category o international demand for the railway track maintenance services and equipment business s products and services is expected to be strong in the long term 
in addition  increased volume of higher margin contract services and manufacturing process improvements and efficiencies are expected to improve margins on a long term basis 
additionally  higher margin international equipment sales will continue to be pursued by this business 
o worldwide supply and demand for steel could have an adverse impact on raw material costs and the ability to obtain the necessary raw materials for most businesses in this category 
the company has implemented certain strategies and plans to help ensure continued product supply to our customers and mitigate the potentially negative impact that rising steel prices could have on operating income 
o the roofing granules and abrasives business is expected to continue to perform well long term  although increased energy costs could reduce operating margins 
this business is pursuing the use of more energy efficient equipment to help mitigate the increased energy related costs 
o due to a strong natural gas market and additional north american opportunities  demand for air cooled heat exchangers is expected to remain strong for gas technologies segment o in january  the company announced its intention to divest the gas technologies business 
this decision is consistent with the company s overall strategic focus on industrial services businesses
