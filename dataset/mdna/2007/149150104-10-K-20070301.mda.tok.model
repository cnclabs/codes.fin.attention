if during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware that a borrower may not be able to meet his or her contractual or payment obligations under a loan  then that loan is supervised more closely with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  the need for an additional allowance for loan losses  and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
under the bank s current policy a loan will be placed on a non accrual status if interest or principal is past due days or more  or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  any current year unpaid accrued interest is reversed against current income and any unpaid accrued interest from the prior year is reversed against the allowance for loan losses 
thereafter  any payment is generally first applied towards the principal balance 
depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and or the loan is well collateralized  and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of

table of contents competition the banking business in california and the other markets served by the bank  is highly competitive 
the bank competes for deposits and loans with other commercial banks  savings and thrift institutions  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
the bank also competes with other banks of similar size that are focused on servicing the same communities that are served by the bank 
in addition  the bank competes with other entities both governmental and private industry that are seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt and equity securities 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and administrative resources than the bank and may also offer services that are not offered directly by the bank  all of which results in greater and more intense competition for the bank 
in addition  current federal legislation encourages increased competition between different types of financial institutions and has encouraged new entrants to enter the financial services market 
competitive conditions are expected to continue to intensify as legislation is enacted which will have the effect of  among other things  i eliminating historical barriers that limited participation by certain institutions in certain markets  ii increasing the cost of doing business for banks  and or iii affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
technological factors  such as on line banking and brokerage services  and economic factors are also expected to increase competitive conditions 
to compete with other financial institutions in its primary service areas  the bank relies principally upon local promotional activities  personal contacts by its officers  directors  employees  and stockholders  extended hours on weekdays  saturday banking  sunday banking in certain locations  internet banking  an internet website www

table of contents regulation and supervision general the bancorp and the bank are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state regulatory agencies 
the following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion 
no assurance can be given that these statutes and regulations will not change in the future 
bank holding company regulation the bancorp is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act bhca and is registered as such with the federal reserve board 
a bank holding company is required to file with the federal reserve board annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its nonbanking subsidiaries 
it is also subject to supervision and examination by the federal reserve board 
examinations are designed to inform the federal reserve board of the financial condition and nature of the operations of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and to monitor compliance with the bhca and other laws affecting the operations of bank holding companies 
to determine whether potential weaknesses in the condition or operations of bank holding companies might pose a risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary banks  examinations focus on whether a bank holding company has adequate systems and internal controls in place to manage the risks inherent in its business  including credit risk  interest rate risk  market risk for example  from changes in value of portfolio instruments and foreign currency  liquidity risk  operational risk  legal risk  and reputation risk 
bank holding companies may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal reserve board for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the federal reserve board or any written agreement with the federal reserve board 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
bank holding companies are subject to capital maintenance requirements on a consolidated basis that are parallel to those required for banks 
see capital adequacy requirements below 
further  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
in addition  it is the federal reserve board s view that  in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its source of strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the federal reserve board s regulations  or both 
the source of strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies where a bank holding company s subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels 
in such a situation  the subsidiary bank will be required by the bank s federal regulator to take prompt corrective action 
the prompt corrective action regulatory framework is discussed below 
see prompt corrective action provisions below 
under the prompt corrective action program  the subsidiary bank will be required to submit to its federal regulator a capital restoration plan and to comply with the plan 
each parent company that controls the subsidiary bank will be required to provide assurances of compliance by the bank with the capital restoration plan 
however  the aggregate liability of such parent companies will not exceed the lesser of i of the bank s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and ii the amount necessary to bring the bank into compliance with the plan 
failure to restore capital under a capital restoration plan can result in the bank s being placed into receivership if it becomes critically undercapitalized 
a bank subject to prompt corrective action also may affect its parent bank holding company in other ways 
these include possible restrictions or prohibitions on dividends to the parent bank holding company by the bank  subordinated debt payments to the parent  and other transactions between the 
table of contents bank and the holding company 
in addition  the regulators may impose restrictions on the ability of the holding company itself to make distributions  require divestiture of holding company affiliates that pose a significant risk to the bank  and require divestiture of the undercapitalized subsidiary bank 
a bank holding company is generally required to give the federal reserve board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities  if the consideration to be paid  together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
a bank holding company is required to obtain federal reserve board approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if it would thereby directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock 
prior approval from the federal reserve is also required in connection with the acquisition of control of a bank or another bank holding company  or business combinations with another bank holding company 
the business activities and investments of bank holding companies are also regulated by the bhca 
bank holding companies  as a general rule  are prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not engaged in the business of banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks 
however  subject to prior approval or notification to the federal reserve board  bank holding companies are permitted to engage in activities that are so closely related to banking as to be deemed a proper incident thereto 
as a general rule  such closely related activities do not include underwriting or dealing in securities or underwriting of insurance 
more expansive non banking activities are permitted for bank holding companies that qualify as financial holding companies under the bhca  but the bancorp has not sought this status even though it qualifies to do so 
see section below entitled financial modernization act 
the bancorp is also a bank holding company within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
therefore  the bancorp and any of its subsidiaries are subject to examination by  and may be required to file reports with  the california department of financial institutions 
financial modernization act the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act became effective march  the financial modernization act 
it repealed two provisions of the glass steagall act section  which restricted the affiliation of federal reserve member banks with firms engaged principally in specified securities activities  and section  which restricted officer  director  or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person primarily engaged in specified securities activities 
in addition  it also contained provisions that expressly preempt any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations  primarily related to insurance 
the general effect of the law is to establish a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms  and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the bhca framework to permit a holding company system to engage in a full range of financial activities through a bank holding company that qualifies as a financial holding company 
financial activities are broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance  and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the federal reserve board  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities  or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
in order for the bancorp to engage in expanded financial activities permissible under the financial modernization act  it must elect to qualify as a financial holding company 
the bancorp currently meets the requirements to make this election  but its management has thus far decided not to do so  as the bancorp has no present intention to engage in the expanded range of financial activities permitted to financial holding companies 

table of contents bank regulation federal law mandates frequent examinations of all banks  with the costs of examinations to be assessed against the bank being examined 
the bank s primary federal regulator is the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic has substantial enforcement powers over the banks that it regulates 
civil and criminal penalties may be imposed on such institutions and persons associated with those institutions for violations of laws or regulations 
as a california commercial bank whose deposits are insured by the fdic  the bank is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the california department of financial institutions and the fdic  and must comply with applicable regulations of the federal reserve board 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the bank s business  including the making of periodic reports  its activities relating to dividends  investments  loans  borrowings  capital requirements  certain check clearing activities  branching  mergers and acquisitions and numerous other areas 
supervision  legal action  and examination by these agencies is generally intended to protect depositors  creditors  borrowers and the deposit insurance fund and generally is not intended for the protection of stockholders 
the activities of the bank are also regulated by state law 
california law authorizes the bank to engage in the commercial banking business  which generally encompasses lending  deposit taking  and all other kinds of banking business in which banks  including national banks  customarily engage in the united states 
in addition  california banks are authorized by state law to invest in subsidiaries that engage in real estate development and conduct certain real estate related activities including property management and real estate appraisal and in management consulting and data processing services for third parties 
such operating subsidiaries are not permitted by california law to engage in insurance activities 
however  federal law prohibits the bank and its subsidiaries from engaging in any banking activities in which a national bank acting as principal rather than agent cannot engage  unless the activity is found by the fdic not to pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund 
this prohibition does not extend to those activities in which the bank or a subsidiary of the bank is authorized under state law to engage as agent  advisor  custodian  administrator or trustee for its customer 
the fdic has found real estate development not to pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund if conducted within specified parameters 
in addition  under the financial modernization act  the bank can engage in expanded financial activities through specially qualified financial subsidiaries to the same extent as a national bank 
in order to form a financial subsidiary  the bank must be well capitalized and would be subject to the same capital deduction  risk management and affiliate transaction rules as apply to national banks 
generally  a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental thereto  even though they are not permissible for the national bank to conduct directly within the bank 
the definition of financial in nature includes  among other items  underwriting  dealing in or making a market in securities  including  for example  distributing shares of mutual funds 
the subsidiary may not  however  engage as principal in underwriting insurance other than credit life insurance  issue annuities  or engage in real estate development or investment or merchant banking 
presently  none of the bank s subsidiaries are financial subsidiaries 
the bank operates branches and or loan production offices in new york  illinois  massachusetts  texas  and washington 
while the california department of financial institutions remains the bank s primary state regulator  the bank s operations in these jurisdictions are subject to examination and supervision by local bank regulators  and transactions with customers in those states are subject to local laws  including consumer protection laws 
the bank also operates representative offices in taipei  shanghai  and hong kong 
the operations of these offices and limits on the scope of their activities are subject to local law in those jurisdictions in addition to regulation and supervision by the california department of financial institutions and the fdic 

table of contents deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures deposits  up to prescribed statutory limits  of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries 
previously  the fdic administered two separate insurance funds  the bank insurance fund bif  which generally insured commercial bank and state savings bank deposits  and the savings association insurance fund saif  which generally insured savings association deposits 
under the federal deposit insurance reform act of the fdi reform act  which was signed into law in february the bif and the saif were merged into a new combined fund  called the deposit insurance fund dif  effective march   the current  deposit insurance coverage cap has been indexed for inflation with adjustments every five years commencing january  deposit insurance coverage for retirement accounts has been increased to  per participant subject to adjustment for inflation  and a cap has been imposed on the level of the dif  providing for the payment of dividends when the dif grows beyond a specified threshold 
the fdic has also been given greater latitude over management of the dif s reserve ratio to help dampen sharp fluctuations in assessment rates 
pursuant to enabling regulations enacted in november of  the fdic has set the designated reserve ratio for at of estimated insured deposits 
the fdi reform act has revised the prior risk based system for assessing premiums  with the intention of more closely linking premiums to the risk posed by institutions to the dif 
the fdic will evaluate risk to the dif based on three primary factors supervisory ratings for all institutions  financial ratios for most institutions  and long term debt issuer ratings for large institutions that have such ratings 
as a result of these rules  it is contemplated that the assessment rates that took effect at the beginning of for nearly all of the industry will vary between five and seven cents for every of domestic deposits 
banks in existence on december   that paid assessments prior to that date or their successors are entitled to a one time credit against future assessments based on their past contributions to the bif 
as a result  most banks will have assessment credits that will initially offset all of their deposit premiums for the bank anticipates that it will be able to offset its deposit insurance premium for with an estimated assessment credit of million for premiums paid prior to in addition  banks must pay a fluctuating amount towards the retirement of the financing corporation bonds commonly referred to as fico bonds which had been issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
the current fico assessment rate as of january   for institutions insured by the deposit insurance fund dif is per of assessable deposit 
the fico assessments are adjusted quarterly and do not vary depending on an institution s capitalization or supervisory evaluations 
these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in capital adequacy requirements the bank as well as the bancorp is subject to capital adequacy regulations 
those regulations incorporate both risk based and leverage capital requirements 
these capital adequacy regulations define capital in terms of core capital elements  or tier capital  and supplemental capital elements  or tier capital 
tier capital is generally defined as the sum of the core capital elements less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on available for sale investment securities carried at fair value 
the following items are included as core capital elements i common shareholders equity  ii qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  including trust preferred securities but not in excess of of tier capital  and iii minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries 

table of contents supplementary capital elements include i allowance for loan and lease losses but not more than of an institution s risk weighted assets  ii perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not qualifying as core capital  iii hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt instruments  and iv term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock and related surplus 
the maximum amount of supplemental capital elements which qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital 
the minimum required ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk weighted assets  or the total risk based capital ratio  is  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital  and the minimum required ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets  or the tier risk based capital ratio  is 
risk based capital ratios are calculated to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under the risk based capital guidelines  the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as business loans 
as of december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
as of december   the bancorp s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was the risk based capital requirements also take into account concentrations of credit ie  relatively large proportions of loans involving one borrower  industry  location  collateral or loan type and the risks of non traditional activities those that have not customarily been part of the banking business 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards and authorize the regulators to review an institution s management of such risks in assessing an institution s capital adequacy 
the risk based capital regulations also include exposure to interest rate risk as a factor that the regulators will consider in evaluating a bank s capital adequacy 
interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and equity capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates 
while interest risk is inherent in a bank s role as financial intermediary  it introduces volatility to bank earnings and to the economic value of the institution 
since  the federal banking regulators have also required financial institutions with significant exposure to market risk to maintain adequate capital to support that exposure 
in september of  the federal banking agencies proposed revisions to the market risk capital rules to enhance the rules sensitivity to market risk and to require public disclosure of certain qualitative and quantitative market risk information 
financial institutions covered by this aspect of the capital rules are those with trading assets constituting or more of total assets  or billion or more  or such other institutions as the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency deems appropriate to include 
neither the bancorp nor the bank is currently subject to the market risk capital rules 
the bancorp and the bank are also required to maintain a leverage capital ratio designed to supplement the risk based capital guidelines 
banks and bank holding companies that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks and that are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of tier capital net of all intangibles to adjusted total assets of at least 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum  for a minimum of to 
pursuant to federal regulations  banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed  including the volume and severity of problem loans 
federal regulators may  however  set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant 
as of december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  and the bancorp s leverage capital ratio was  both ratios exceeding regulatory minimums 
the federal regulatory authorities risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision basel i 
in june  the basel committee on banking supervision published a new capital accord  referred to as basel ii  for adoption by those countries adhering to 
table of contents the overall basel framework 
basel ii emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements 
basel ii will become mandatory for us banks with over billion in assets or total on balance sheet foreign exposure of billion or more 
other banks can elect to be governed by basel ii 
basel ii would not apply to the bancorp or the bank  and management does not contemplate electing to calculate its risk based capital based on the basel ii capital framework 
in october  us banking regulators issued an advance rulemaking notice that contemplated modifications to the basel i risk based capital framework applicable to domestic banking organizations that are not required or do not elect to adopt basel ii 
this was followed by a rulemaking notice dated december   also proposing modifications to the basel i framework 
these proposed modifications to basel i are referred to as basel a 
basel a is designed to redress perceived competitive inequities between financial institutions using basel ii and those using basel i 
in principle  basel a would i expand the number of risk weight categories  ii allow the use of external credit ratings to risk weight certain exposures  iii expand the range of collateral and guarantors that qualify for a lower risk weight  iv use loan to value ratios to risk weight most residential mortgages  and v revise other provisions of the existing risk based capital requirements to increase the risk sensitivity of the risk based capital rules for those banks that will not use basel ii 
if implemented  basel a would likely apply to the bancorp and the bank 
prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action when a bank falls below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage capital ratio of  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage capital ratio of or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage capital ratio of less than or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage capital ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 
undercapitalized banks are required to submit capital restoration plans and  during any period of capital inadequacy  may not pay dividends or make other capital distributions  are subject to asset growth and expansion restrictions and may not be able to accept brokered deposits 
at each successively lower capital category  banks are subject to increased restrictions on operations 
dividends holders of the bancorp s common stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore under the laws of the state of delaware 
delaware corporations such as the bancorp may make distributions to their stockholders out of their surplus  or out of their net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and for the preceding fiscal year 
however  dividends may not be paid out of a corporation s net profits if  after the payment of the dividend  the corporation s capital would be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets 
the federal reserve board has advised bank holding companies that it believes that payment of cash dividends in excess of current earnings from operations is inappropriate and may be cause for supervisory action 
as a result of this policy  banks and their holding companies may find it difficult to pay dividends out of retained 
table of contents earnings from historical periods prior to the most recent fiscal year or to take advantage of earnings generated by extraordinary items such as sales of buildings or other large assets in order to generate profits to enable payment of future dividends 
further  the federal reserve board s position that holding companies are expected to provide a source of managerial and financial strength to their subsidiary banks potentially restricts a bank holding company s ability to pay dividends 
the bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company 
the bancorp receives income through dividends paid by the bank 
subject to the regulatory restrictions described below  future cash dividends by the bank will depend upon management s assessment of future capital requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
the powers of the board of directors of the bank to declare a cash dividend to its holding company is subject to california law  which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank s retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years less any distributions to shareholders made during such period 
where the above test is not met  cash dividends may still be paid  with the prior approval of the california department of financial institutions in an amount not exceeding the greatest of retained earnings of the bank  the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
the amount of retained earnings available for cash dividends to the bancorp immediately after december   is restricted to approximately million under this regulation 
bank regulators also have authority to prohibit a bank from engaging in business practices considered to be unsafe or unsound 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of a bank and other factors  that such regulators could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under certain circumstances  be an unsafe or unsound practice  even if technically permissible 
safety and soundness standards and enforcement actions the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines set forth managerial and operational standards relating to i internal controls and information systems  ii internal audit systems  iii loan documentation  iv credit underwriting  v  interest rate exposure  vi asset growth  vii asset quality  viii earnings and ix compensation and benefits 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet safety and soundness standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted or the deficiency is not corrected 
in addition to these measures and the prompt corrective action provisions  banks may be subject to potential actions by federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  termination of insurance of deposits  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
guidance on nontraditional mortgage products on september   the federal banking agencies issued final guidance on residential mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal or interest  including interest only mortgage loans  and payment option adjustable rate mortgages where a borrower has flexible payment options  including payments that have the potential for negative amortization 
the guidance does not apply to home equity lines of credit 
while acknowledging that innovations in mortgage lending can benefit some consumers  the federal banking agencies in their joint press release stated their concern that these and other practices described in the guidance 
table of contents can present unique risks that institutions must appropriately manage 
the guidance states that management should ensure that loan terms and underwriting standards are consistent with prudent lending practices  including consideration of a borrower s repayment capacity  recognize that many nontraditional mortgages are untested in a stressed environment and warrant strong risk management standards as well as appropriate capital and loan loss reserves  and ensure that borrowers have sufficient information to clearly understand loan terms and associated risks prior to making a product or payment choice 
it is uncertain at this time what effect the final guidance may have on financial institutions originating such residential mortgage products 
as of december   the bank retained loans with balance of million under reduced documentation programs and one loan with balance of  under a simultaneous second lien loan program 
no nontraditional residential mortgages were sold by the bank during guidance on real estate concentrations on december   the federal banking agencies issued a guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution 
the purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations 
the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies will be focusing their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk 
a bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan  or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent or more of the bank s capital  or total commercial real estate loans as defined in the guidance represent or more of the bank s total capital and the outstanding balance of the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased or more during the prior months 
the strength of an institution s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy 
at december   total commercial real estate loans as defined in the guidance were of the bank s total capital 
it is uncertain at this time what effect this guidance may have on the bank 
transactions with affiliates federal banking law imposes restrictions on extensions of credit by the bank to the bancorp or its nonbanking affiliates  the purchase by the bank of assets of  or securities issued by  the bancorp or its nonbanking affiliates  and the taking by the bank of securities issued by the bancorp as collateral for loans made by the bank 
such restrictions prevent the bancorp and its nonbanking affiliates from borrowing from the bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts 
further  these secured loans and investments by the bank to or in the bancorp  or to or in any nonbanking affiliate  are limited  individually  to of the bank s capital and surplus  and these secured loans and investments are limited  in the aggregate  to of the bank s capital and surplus 
california law also imposes certain restrictions with respect to transactions involving persons or entities controlling the bank  such as the bancorp  and requires that such transactions be approved in advance by the california department of financial institutions 
additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates may be imposed on the bank under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law discussed above 
see prompt corrective action provisions below 

table of contents loans to one borrower with certain limited exceptions  the maximum amount that a california bank may lend to any borrower at any one time including the obligations to the bank of certain related entities of the borrower may not exceed and unsecured loans may not exceed of the bank s shareholder equity  allowance for loan losses  and any capital notes and debentures of the bank 
extension of credit to insiders federal law place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank s or bank holding company s executive officers  directors  and principal shareholders ie  in most cases  those persons who own  control or have power to vote more than of any class of voting securities  any company controlled by any such executive officer  director  or shareholder  or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer  director  or principal shareholder 
loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with california s loan to one borrower limits described above  require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts  must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non insiders  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment  or present other unfavorable features 
a bank is also prohibited from paying an overdraft on an account of an executive officer or director  except pursuant to a written pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre authorized transfer of funds from another account of the executive officer or director at the bank 
in addition  the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a california bank as a group cannot exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving the community reinvestment act cra 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra further requires the agencies to take into account a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in measuring a bank s compliance with its cra obligations  the regulators utilize a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on the bank s actual lending  service  and investment performance  rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach activities  or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the fdic assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
in its most recently released public reports  from february  the bank received a satisfactory rating 
other consumer protection laws and regulations examination and enforcement have become intense  and banks have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with various consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities it serves 

table of contents in addition to the other laws and regulations discussed herein  the bank is subject to certain consumer and public interest laws and regulations that are designed to protect customers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth below is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the fair credit reporting act  the fair debt collection practices act  and the right to financial privacy act 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans  and providing other services 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the bank to various penalties  including but not limited to enforcement actions  injunctions  fines or criminal penalties  punitive damages to consumers  and the loss of certain contractual rights 
the americans with disabilities act  in conjunction with similar california legislation  has increased the cost of doing business for banks 
the legislation requires employers with or more employees and all businesses operating commercial facilities or public accommodations to accommodate disabled employees and customers 
the americans with disabilities act has two major objectives i to prevent discrimination against disabled job applicants  job candidates and employees  and ii to provide disabled persons with ready access to commercial facilities and public accommodations 
commercial facilities  such as the bank  must ensure that all new facilities are accessible to disabled persons  and in some instances may be required to adapt existing facilities to make them accessible 
interstate banking and branching federal law regulates the interstate activities of banks and bank holding companies and establishes a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
since june   a bank in one state has generally been permitted to merge with a bank in another state without the need for explicit state law authorization 
however  states generally were given the ability to prohibit interstate mergers with banks in their own state by opting out enacting state legislation applying equality to all out of state banks prohibiting such mergers prior to june  since  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies have been permitted to acquire banks located in any state  subject to two exceptions first  any state may still prohibit bank holding companies from acquiring a bank which is less than five years old  and second  no interstate acquisition can be completed by a bank holding company if the acquirer would control more than of the deposits held by insured depository institutions nationwide or or more of the deposits held by insured depository institutions in any state in which the target bank has branches 
a bank may establish and operate de novo branches in any state in which that bank does not maintain a branch if that state has enacted legislation to expressly permit all out of state banks to establish branches in that state 
bank secrecy act and usa patriot act the bank secrecy act bsa is a disclosure law that forms the basis of the federal government s framework to prevent and detect money laundering and to deter other criminal enterprises 
under the bsa  financial institutions such as the bank are required to maintain certain records and file certain reports regarding domestic currency transactions and cross border transportations of currency 
among other requirements  the bsa requires financial institutions to report imports and exports of currency in the amount of  or more and  in general  all cash transactions of  or more 
the bank has established a bsa compliance policy under which  among other precautions  the bank keeps currency transaction reports to document cash transactions in excess of  or in multiples totaling more than  during one business day  monitors certain potentially suspicious transactions such as the exchange of a large number of small denomination bills for 
table of contents large denomination bills  and scrutinizes electronic funds transfers for bsa compliance 
the bsa also requires that financial institutions report to relevant law enforcement agencies any suspicious transactions potentially involving violations of law 
the terrorist attacks in september impacted the financial services industry and led to the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  or the usa patriot act 
part of the usa patriot act is the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of  or imlafata 
pursuant to imlafata  an additional purpose was added to the bsa to assist in the conduct of intelligence or counter intelligence activities  including analysis  to protect against international terrorism 
imlafata also significantly expanded the role of financial institutions in combating money laundering 
in particular  it required financial institutions to establish anti money laundering programs  which  at a minimum  include internal policies  procedures  and controls designed to prevent the institution from being used for money laundering  the designation of a bsa compliance officer  ongoing employee training  and an independent audit program to test the effectiveness of the institution s anti money laundering programs 
the fdic and the other federal banking agencies promptly adopted regulations requiring each financial institution to establish comprehensive anti money laundering compliance programs designed to assure compliance with the bsa and otherwise meeting the statutory requirements for such programs set forth in imlafata 
in addition  these regulations required each financial institution to establish a customer identification program to be implemented as part of the institution s anti money laundering compliance program 
imlafata authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the heads of other government agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to banks  bank holding companies  and or other financial institutions 
these measures may include enhanced recordkeeping and reporting requirements for certain financial transactions that are of primary money laundering concern  due diligence requirements concerning the beneficial ownership of certain types of accounts  and restrictions or prohibitions on certain types of accounts with foreign financial institutions 
among its other provisions  imlafata requires each financial institution to i establish due diligence policies  procedures  and controls with respect to its private banking accounts and correspondent banking accounts involving foreign individuals and certain foreign banks and ii avoid establishing  maintaining  administering  or managing correspondent accounts in the united states of america for  or on behalf of  a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country 
in addition  imlafata contains a provision encouraging cooperation among financial institutions  regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals  entities  and organizations engaged in  or reasonably suspected of engaging in  terrorist acts or money laundering activities 
imlafata expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies within hours 
imlafata also requires the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing an application under the bhca or in connection with a potential bank merger under the bank merger act 
customer information security the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential  personal customer information 
the guidelines require each financial institution  under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof  to create  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 

table of contents privacy the bank is required under federal law to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non affiliate third parties 
in general  the statute requires a financial institution to i provide notice to customers about its privacy policies and practices  ii describe the conditions under which the institution may disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties  and iii provide a method for consumers to prevent the financial institution from disclosing that information to nonaffiliated third parties by opting out of that disclosure 
securities exchange act of the bancorp s common stock is publicly held and listed on nasdaq  and the bancorp is subject to the periodic reporting  information  proxy solicitation  insider trading  corporate governance and other requirements and restrictions of the securities exchange act of and the regulations of the securities and exchange commission promulgated hereunder and the listing requirements of nasdaq 
sarbanes oxley act the sarbanes oxley act of implemented legislative reforms applicable to companies with securities traded publicly in the united states of america 
the sarbanes oxley act is intended to address corporate and accounting fraud and contains provisions dealing with corporate governance and management  disclosure  oversight of the accounting profession and auditor independence 
although the bancorp has incurred and expects to continue to incur additional expenses in complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  it does not expect that compliance will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
audit requirements the bank is required to have an annual independent audit  alone or as a part of its bank holding company s audit  and to prepare all financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the bank or the bancorp is also required to have an audit committee comprised entirely of independent directors 
as required by nasdaq  the bancorp has certified that its audit committee has adopted formal written charters and meets the requisite number of directors  independence  and qualification standards 
in addition  because the bank has more than billion in total assets  it is subject to the fdic requirements for audit committees of large institutions 
as such  among other requirements  the bancorp must maintain an audit committee which includes members with banking or related financial management expertise  has access to its own outside counsel  and does not include members who are large customers of the bank 
the sarbanes oxley act of addresses accounting oversight and corporate governance matters 
management and the bancorp s independent registered public accounting firm are required to assess the effectiveness of the bancorp s internal control over financial reporting as of december  these assessments are included in item a  controls and procedures  below

table of contents impact of monetary policies the earnings and growth of the bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
as a result  the bank s performance is influenced by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and the policies of the regulatory agencies 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks from the federal reserve banks 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and deposits 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
environmental regulation in the course of the bank s business  the bank may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
the bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clear up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of any contaminated site  the bank may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if the bank ever becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities  its business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
other pending and proposed legislation other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the bancorp and the bank and the banking industry in general are pending  and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced  before the us congress  the california legislature  and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation  and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject the bancorp and the bank to increased regulation  disclosure  and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the bancorp or the bank would be affected thereby 
item a 
risk factors 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable loan losses 
actual loan losses in excess of the estimate could adversely affect our net income and capital 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the probable losses from our loan portfolio 
if actual losses exceed the estimate  the excess losses could adversely affect our net income and capital 
such excess losses could also lead to larger allowances for loan losses in future periods  which could in turn adversely affect net income and capital in those periods 
if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in the estimate or adverse developments arise with respect to our loans  future losses may occur  and increases in the allowance may be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance 
these agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and adversely affect our business 
the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by fluctuations in interest rates 
the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates  events over which we have no control  may have an adverse effect on net interest income 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels  which are also impacted by changes in interest rates  can significantly affect our assets and liabilities 
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations  which could in turn lead to an increase in non performing assets and net charge offs 
generally  the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the company do not change at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
even assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods of repricing may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates 
certain assets  such as fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
we seek to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates by structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
we use interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to assist us in estimating the optimal asset liability composition 
however  such management tools have inherent limitations that impair their effectiveness 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates

we have engaged in and may continue to engage in further expansion through mergers and acquisitions  which could negatively affect our business and earnings 
we have engaged in and may continue to engage in expansion through mergers and acquisitions 
there are risks associated with such expansion 
these risks include  among others  incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a bank acquired in a particular transaction  encountering greater than anticipated costs in integrating acquired businesses  facing resistance from customers or employees  and being unable to profitably deploy assets acquired in the transaction 
additional country and region specific risks are associated with transactions outside the united states  including in china 
to the extent we issue capital stock in connection with additional transactions  these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership 
our earnings  financial condition  and prospects after a merger or acquisition depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company 
we may be unable to integrate operations successfully or to achieve expected cost savings 
any cost savings which are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings 
inflation and deflation may adversely affect our financial performance 
the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation or deflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
conversely  deflation will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality 
virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general levels of inflation or deflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 

table of contents as we expand our business outside of california markets  we will encounter risks that could adversely affect us 
we primarily operate in california markets with a concentration of chinese american individuals and businesses  however  one of our strategies is to expand beyond california into other domestic markets that have concentrations of chinese american individuals and businesses 
in the course of this expansion  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these risks and uncertainties include increased operational difficulties arising from  among other things  our ability to attract sufficient business in new markets  to manage operations in noncontiguous market areas  and to anticipate events or differences in markets in which we have no current experience 
to the extent that we expand through acquisitions  such acquisitions may also adversely harm our business  if we fail to adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions 
for example  risks can include difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology  and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  use of cash resources  large write offs  and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets with finite lives 
our financial results could be adversely affected by changes in california tax law and changes in its interpretation relating to registered investment companies and real estate investment trusts 
our effective income tax rate was lower in and than in subsequent years due in large part to income tax benefits derived from a registered investment company subsidiary of the bank 
we had relied on the california tax law related to registered investment companies and on an outside tax opinion in creating this subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter of  a change in that law was enacted by the california legislature  which would deny such tax benefits from and after january  on december   the california franchise tax board ftb announced its position that certain tax deductions related to regulated investment companies as well as real estate investment trusts prior to january  would also be disallowed 
in december   we decided to deregister the registered investment company and  in february   we completed such deregistration 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  the company reversed the net state tax benefits recorded in the first three quarters of relating to the real estate investment trust reit that it formed as a subsidiary of the bank during the company did not record any tax benefits relating to the reit in the fourth quarter of and did not record any such benefits in   or as previously disclosed  on december   the california franchise tax board ftb announced its intent to list certain transactions that in its view constitute potentially abusive tax shelters 
included in the transactions subject to this listing were transactions utilizing regulated investment companies rics and real estate investment trusts reits 
as part of the notification indicating the listed transactions  the ftb also indicated its position that it intends to disallow tax benefits associated with these transactions 
while the company continues to believe that the tax benefits recorded in three prior years with respect to its regulated investment company were appropriate and fully defensible under california law  the company has deemed it prudent to participate in voluntary compliance initiative option  requiring payment of all california taxes and interest on these disputed through tax benefits  and permitting the company to claim a refund for these years while avoiding certain potential penalties 
the company retains potential exposure for assertion of an accuracy related penalty should the ftb prevail in its position in addition to the risk of not being successful in its refund claims 
as of december   the company reflected a million net state tax receivable for the years   and after giving effect to reserves for loss contingencies on the refund claims  or an equivalent of million after giving effect to federal tax benefits 
the ftb is currently in the process of reviewing and assessing our refund claims for taxes and interest for tax years through the company does not expect that its refund claims related to its regulated investment company will more likely than not be realized and consequently  expects to include the million after tax amount related to its refund claim in its

adverse economic conditions in california and other regions where the bank has operations could cause us to incur losses 
our banking operations are concentrated primarily in southern and northern california  and secondarily in new york  texas  massachusetts  washington  and illinois 
adverse economic conditions in these regions could impair borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  and erode the value of loan collateral 
these events could increase the amount of our non performing assets and have an adverse effect on our efforts to collect our non performing loans or otherwise liquidate our non performing assets including other real estate owned on terms favorable to us 
real estate securing our lending activities is also principally located in southern and northern california  and to a lesser extent  in new york  texas  massachusetts  washington  and illinois 
the value of such collateral depends upon conditions in the relevant real estate markets 
these include general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  real estate tax rates  the cost of operating the properties  governmental regulations and fiscal policies  acts of nature including earthquakes  flood and hurricanes which may result in uninsured losses  and other factors beyond our control 
the risks inherent in construction lending may adversely affect our net income 
the risks inherent in construction lending may adversely affect our net income 
such risks include  among other things  the possibility that contractors may fail to complete  or complete on a timely basis  construction of the relevant properties  substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing  market deterioration during construction  and lack of permanent take out financing 
loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because such properties have no operating history 
in these loans  loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion of construction  and the estimated operating cash flow to be generated by the completed project 
there is no assurance that such properties will be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower 
such consideration can affect the borrowers ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral 
our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not insure the value of the real property collateral 
in considering whether to make a loan on or secured by real property  we generally require an appraisal of such property 
however  the appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made 
if the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property  we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property 
we face substantial competition from larger competitors 
we face substantial competition for deposits and loans  as well as other banking services  throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry 
this may cause our cost of funds to exceed that of our competitors 
such banks and financial institutions have greater resources than us  including the ability to finance advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to regions of higher yield and demand 
by virtue of their larger capital bases  such institutions have substantially greater lending limits than us and perform certain functions  including trust services  which are not presently offered by us 
we also compete for loans and deposits  as well as other banking services  with savings and loan associations  finance companies  money market funds  brokerage houses  credit unions and non financial institutions 

table of contents adverse effects of banking regulations or changes in banking regulations could adversely affect our business by increasing our expenses  limiting our activities  or altering the competitive balance 
we are regulated by significant federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers or which serve other public policies and not for the benefit of our stockholders 
in the past  our business has been materially affected by such regulation and supervision 
this trend is likely to continue in the future 
laws  regulations  or policies currently affecting us may change at any time 
regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of existing laws and regulations 
it is impossible to predict the competitive impact that any such changes would have on commercial banking in general or on our business in particular 
such changes may  among other things  increase the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities  or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
adverse economic conditions in asia could adversely affect our business 
a substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to asia and  as a result  we are likely to feel the effects of adverse economic and political conditions in asia 
us and global economic policies  military tensions  and unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the asian economies 
if economic conditions in asia deteriorate  we could  among other things  be exposed to economic and transfer risk  and could experience an outflow of deposits by those of our customers with connections to asia 
transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity 
this may adversely impact the recoverability of investments with or loans made to such entities 
adverse economic conditions in asia  and in china or taiwan in particular  may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of our customers who operate in this region 
statutory restrictions on dividends and other distributions from the bank may adversely impact us by limiting the amount of distributions the bancorp may receive 
a substantial portion of the bancorp s cash flow comes from dividends that the bank pays to us 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends that the bank can pay without regulatory approval 
in addition  if the bank were to liquidate  the bank s creditors would be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of the bank to satisfy their claims against the bank before bancorp  as a holder of the equity interest in the bank  would be entitled to receive any of the assets of the bank 
our need to continue to adapt to our information technology systems to allow us to provide new and expanded services could present operational issues and require significant capital spending 
as we continue to offer internet banking and other on line services to our customers  and continue to expand our existing conventional banking services  we will need to adapt our information technology systems to handle these changes in a way that meets constantly changing industry and regulatory standards 
this can be very expensive and may require significant capital expenditures 
in addition  our success will depend  among other things  on our ability to provide secure and reliable services  anticipate changes in technology  and efficiently develop and introduce services that are accepted by our customers and cost effective for us to provide 
systems failures  delays  breaches of confidentiality and other problems could harm our reputation and business 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws  and rights agreement could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws  and rights agreement between us and american stock transfer and trust company  as rights agent  could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
these provisions include authorized but unissued shares of preferred and common stock that may be issued without stockholder approval  three classes of directors serving staggered terms  preferred share purchase rights that generally become exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a 
table of contents tender offer for or more of our common stock  special requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for director  and super majority voting requirements in certain situations including certain types of business combinations 
terrorist attacks could adversely affect us 
any terrorist attacks and responses to such activities could adversely affect the company in a number of ways  including  among others  an increase in delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults that could result in a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses

actual results in any future period may vary from the past results discussed in this report 
given these risks and uncertainties  we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements  which speak as of the date hereof 
we have no intention and undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement or to publicly announce the results of any revision of any forward looking statement to reflect future developments or events 
the financial information presented herein includes the accounts of the company  its subsidiaries  including the bank  and the bank s consolidated subsidiaries 
all material transactions between these entities are eliminated 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 

table of contents management believes the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounting for the allowance for loan losses the determination of the amount of the provision for loan losses charged to operations reflects management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in economic and business conditions  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans  changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management  changes in the volume and severity of past due  nonaccrual and adversely classified or graded loans  changes in the quality of the loan review system  changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and the effect of competition  legal and regulatory requirements  and other external factors 
the nature of the process by which the bank determines the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the bank s control  including the performance of the bank s loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  or defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses in future periods 
the total allowance for loan losses consists of two components specific allowances and general allowances 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  the bank employs two primary methodologies  the classification migration methodology and the individual loan review analysis methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of the bank s allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  trends in the non performing non accrual loans  loan delinquencies  the volume of the portfolio  peer group comparisons  and federal regulatory policy for loan and lease losses 
other significant factors of portfolio analysis include changes in lending policies underwriting standards  portfolio composition  and concentrations of credit  and trends in the national and local economy 
with these above methodologies  the specific allowance is for those loans internally classified and risk graded as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
additionally  the bank s management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
allowances for other risks of probable loan losses have been included in the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the bank has set aside funds to cover the risk factors of higher energy prices on the ability of its borrowers to service their loans 
accounting for acquisitions accounting for acquisitions of other financial institutions involves significant judgments and assumptions by management  which has a material impact on the carrying value of fixed rate loans and borrowings and the determination of the core deposit intangible asset and goodwill 
except for the resolution of any pre acquisition income tax uncertainties  no additional fair value adjustments can be made after the end of the allocation period of one year 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain 
table of contents investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income loss 
investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income reported for financial statement purposes  and differs from the amount of taxes currently payable  since certain income and expense items are reported for financial statement purposes in different periods than those for tax reporting purposes 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
on december   the california franchise tax board ftb announced its intent to list certain transactions that in its view constitute potentially abusive tax shelters 
included in the transactions subject to this listing were transactions utilizing regulated investment companies rics and real estate investment trusts reits 
as part of the notification indicating the listed transactions  the ftb also indicated its position that it intends to disallow tax benefits associated with these transactions 
while the company continues to believe that the tax benefits recorded in three prior years with respect to its regulated investment company were appropriate and fully defensible under california law  the company has deemed it prudent to participate in voluntary compliance initiative option  requiring payment of all california taxes and interest on these disputed through tax benefits  and permitting the company to claim a refund for these years while avoiding certain potential penalties 
the company retains potential exposure for assertion of an accuracy related penalty should the ftb prevail in its position in addition to the risk of not being successful in its refund claims 
as of december   the company reflected a million net state tax receivable for the years   and after giving effect to reserves for loss contingencies on the refund claims  or an equivalent of million after giving effect to federal tax benefits 
the ftb is currently in the process of reviewing and assessing our refund claims for taxes and interest for tax years through the company does not expect that its refund claim related to its regulated investment company will more likely than not be realized and consequently  expects to include the million after tax amount related to its refund claim in its cumulative effect adjustment for interpretation no 
as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the january  effective date of interpretation no

risk elements of the loan portfolio non performing assets non performing assets include loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and other real estate owned 
the company s policy is to place loans on non accrual status if interest and principal or either interest or principal is past due days or more  or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any current year unpaid accrued interest is reversed against current income and any unpaid accrued interest from prior year is reversed against the allowance for loan losses 
thereafter  any payment is generally first applied towards the principal balance 
depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and or the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
management reviews the loan portfolio regularly for problem loans 
during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of the loan agreements 
such loans are placed under closer supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  the need for an additional allowance for loan losses  and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
our non performing assets increased million  or  to million at year end compared to million at year end the increase in non performing assets was primarily due to a million increase in other real estate owned  a million increase in non accrual loans  including million in loans acquired from new asia bank  and a million increase in accruing loans past due days or more as a result of one loan which was renewed after december   and which is expected to be paid off in full by march  as a percentage of gross loans plus other real estate owned  our non performing assets increased to at year end from at year end the non performing loan coverage ratio  defined as the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans  decreased to at year end  from at year end

troubled debt restructurings a troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructure of a loan when the lender  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower 
the concessions may be granted in various forms  including reduction in the stated interest rate  reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest  and extension of the maturity date 
troubled debt restructurings  excluding those on non accrual status  decreased million to million from a single borrower at december   compared to million at december  at december   the restructured loans were performing under their revised terms 
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on current circumstances and events 
the assessment for impairment occurs when and while such loans are on non accrual  or the loan has been restructured 
those loans less than our defined selection criteria  generally the loan amount less than  are treated as a homogeneous portfolio 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are not collateral dependent  we measure the impairment based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s 
table of contents effective interest rate 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are collateral dependent  we measure the impairment by using the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral 
if the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded amount of the loan  we then recognize impairment by creating or adjusting an existing valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses

allowance for loan losses the bank s maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered to be equal to the estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
with this risk management objective  the bank s management has an established monitoring system that is designed to identify impaired and potential problem loans  and to permit periodic evaluation of impairment and the adequacy level of the allowance for loan losses in a timely manner 
in addition  our board of directors has established a written loan policy that includes a loan review and control system which it believes should be effective in ensuring that the bank maintains an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process  including quarterly evaluations  and determines whether the allowance is adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the provision for loan losses is based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectibility when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
the nature of the process by which the bank determines the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the bank s control  including the performance of the bank s loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates  and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
identified credit exposures that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts  if any  are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  or defaults  and a

the following table sets forth the information relating to the allowance for loan losses  charge offs  and recoveries for the past five years allowance for loan losses amount outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year provision reversal for loan losses charge offs commercial loans real estate loans installment loans and other loans total charge offs recoveries commercial loans real estate loans installment loans and other loans total recoveries allowance from acquisitions balance at end of year average loans outstanding during year ended ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding during the year provision for loan losses to average loans outstanding during the year allowance to non performing loans at year end allowance to gross loans at year end our allowance for loan losses consists of the following specific allowance for impaired loans  we provide specific allowances based on an evaluation of impairment  and for each criticized loan  we allocate a portion of the general allowance to each loan based on a loss percentage assigned 
the percentage assigned depends on a number of factors including loan classification  the current financial condition of the borrowers and guarantors  the prevailing value of the underlying collateral  charge off history  management s knowledge of the portfolio  and general economic conditions 
general allowance the unclassified portfolio is segmented on a group basis 
segmentation is determined by loan type and by identifying risk characteristics that are common to the groups of loans 
the allowance is provided to each segmented group based on the group s historical loan loss experience  the trends in delinquency and non accrual  and other significant factors  such as national and local economy  trends and conditions  strength of management and loan staff  underwriting standards  and the concentration of credit 

table of contents the total allowance for loan losses consists of the above two components specific and general 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  the bank employs two primary methodologies  the classification migration methodology and the individual loan review analysis methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of the bank s allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  trends in the non performing non accrual loans  loan delinquencies  the volume of the portfolio  peer group comparisons  and federal regulatory policy for loan and lease losses 
other significant factors of portfolio analysis include changes in lending policies underwriting standards  portfolio composition  and concentrations of credit  and trends in the national and local economy 
with these above methodologies  the specific allowance is for those loans internally classified and risk graded as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
additionally  the bank s management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
the table set forth below reflects management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to the total loans as of the dates indicated allocation of allowance for loan losses as of december  amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans dollars in thousands type of loans commercial loans residential mortgage loans and equity lines commercial mortgage loans real estate construction loans installment loans other loans total the increase in the allowance allocated to commercial loans resulted from the increase in the level of non accrual and problem loans during commercial loans by collateral type comprised of impaired loans and of non accrual loans and of loans over days still on accrual status at december  commercial loans also comprised of impaired loans  of non accrual loans  and of loans over days still on accrual status at december  allowance allocated to residential mortgage loans and equity lines also increased from million at december   to million at december   due to the increase in loan volume in this category 
the increase in the allowance allocated to commercial real estate mortgages from million at december   to million at december   was due to the strong growth in commercial real estate mortgages during loan losses have been nominal during the past five years in this category 
the overall allowance decreased to 
table of contents of total commercial real estate mortgages at december   compared to of total commercial real estate mortgages at december  due to improved credit quality 
the allocated allowance for construction loans was million  or  of construction loans at december   compared to million  or  of construction loans at december  primarily as the result of the growth in the construction loan portfolio 
at december   two construction loans totaling million were on non accrual status and three construction loans totaling million were past due days and still accruing interest 
at december   there were no construction loans on non accrual status and no construction loan was past due days and still accruing interest 
allowances for other risks of probable loan losses amounting to million as of december   compared to million as of december   have been included in the allocations above 
at december   the bank has set aside funds to cover the risk factors of higher energy prices on the ability of its borrowers to service their loans 
during  management determined the other component of other portfolio risk identified at december   the lifting of textile quotes on chinese manufacturers and the impact of the increased competition on the bank s borrowers in the textile industry  was no longer required since this portfolio risk has now been captured in the bank s loan grading system

liquidity liquidity is our ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet maturing financial obligations and customer credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented in the marketplace 
our principal sources of liquidity are growth in deposits  proceeds from the maturity or sale of securities and other financial instruments  repayments from securities and loans  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and advances from the fhlb 
at year end  our liquidity ratio defined as net cash  short term and marketable securities to net deposits and short term liabilities increased to  compared to at year end to supplement its liquidity needs  the bank maintains a total credit line of million for federal funds with three correspondent banks as well as master agreements with brokerage firms for the sale of securities subject to repurchase 
the bank is also a shareholder of the fhlb  which enables the bank to have access to lower cost fhlb financing when necessary 
at december   the bank had an approved credit line with the fhlb of san francisco totaling billion 
the total advances outstanding with the fhlb of san francisco at december   were million 
advances from fhlb are non callable and bear fixed rates of interest 
these borrowings are secured by loans and securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity can also be provided through the sale of liquid assets  which consist of federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and securities available for sale 
at december   such assets at fair value totaled billion  with million pledged as collateral for borrowings and other commitments 
the remaining million was available as additional liquidity or to be pledged as collateral for additional borrowings 
approximately of our time deposits mature within one year or less as of december  management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the keen competition in the bank s marketplace 
however  based on our historical runoff experience  we expect the outflow will not be significant and can be replenished through our normal growth in deposits 
management believes all the above mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity for the next twelve months to the bank to meet its operating needs 

table of contents the bancorp obtains funding for its activities primarily through dividend income contributed by the bank  proceeds from the issuance of the bancorp common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan and exercise of stock options 
dividends paid to the bancorp by the bank are subject to regulatory limitations 
the business activities of the bancorp consist primarily of the operation of the bank with limited activities in other investments 
management believes the bancorp s liquidity generated from its prevailing sources is sufficient to meet its operational needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the principal market risk to the company is the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities  due to the fact that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not re price at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we monitor and manage our interest rate risk through analyzing the re pricing characteristics of our loans  securities  and deposits on an on going basis 
the primary objective is to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our earnings  and ultimately the underlying market value of equity  while structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
management uses certain basic measurement tools in conjunction with established risk limits to regulate its interest rate exposure 
due to the limitation inherent in any individual risk management tool  we use a simulation model to measure and quantify the impact to our profitability as well as to estimate changes to the market value of our assets and liabilities 
we use a net interest income simulation model to measure the extent of the differences in the behavior of the lending and funding rates to changing interest rates  so as to project future earnings or market values under alternative interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk arises primarily through the company s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates  and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
the net interest income simulation model is designed to measure the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value  defined as net present value of assets and liabilities  under immediate rising or falling interest rate scenarios in basis points increments 
although the modeling is very helpful in managing interest rate risk  it does require significant assumptions for the projection of loan prepayment rates on mortgage related assets  loan volumes and pricing  and deposit and borrowing volume and pricing  that might prove inaccurate 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income  or precisely predict the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rates changes  the differences between actual experience and the assumed volume  changes in market conditions  and management strategies  among other factors 
the company monitors its interest rate sensitivity and attempts to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by a change in interest rates 
we establish a tolerance level in our policy to define and limit interest income volatility to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
when the net interest rate simulation projects that our tolerance level will be met or exceeded  we seek corrective action after considering  
table of contents among other things  market conditions  customer reaction  and the estimated impact on profitability 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by  and if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by 
conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by  and if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by 
our simulation model also projects the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities 
we have established a tolerance level to value the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities in our policy to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities would decrease by  and conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our assets and liabilities would increase by  which is just slightly in excess of our policy limit of 

table of contents quantitative information about interest rate risk the following table shows the carrying value of our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  as well as the instruments total fair values at december   and for assets  expected maturities are based on contractual maturity 
for liabilities  we use our historical experience and decay factors to estimate the deposit runoffs of interest bearing transactional deposits 
we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet commitments to extend credit  letters of credit  and bill of lading guarantees represent the contractual unfunded amounts 
off balance sheet financial instruments represent fair values 
the results presented may vary if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used

however  the company enters into financial derivatives in order to seek mitigation of exposure to interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we believe that these transactions  when properly structured and managed  may provide a hedge against inherent interest rate risk in the company s assets or liabilities and against risk in specific transactions 
in such instances  the company may protect its position through the purchase or sale of interest rate futures contracts for a specific cash or interest rate risk position 
other hedge transactions may be implemented using interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements  and options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we seek to analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies 
all hedges will require an assessment of basis risk and must be approved by the bank s investment committee 
the company follows sfas no 
which established accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives  including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the 
table of contents recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and if so  the type of hedge 
fair value is based on dealer quotes  or quoted prices from instruments with similar characteristics 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reflected in current earnings  together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item if there is a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged 
if there is not a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged  then only the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
on march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution in the notional amount of million for a period of five years 
the interest rate swap was for the purpose of hedging the cash flows from a portion of our floating rate loans against declining rates 
the purpose of the hedge was to provide a measure of stability in the future cash receipts of such loans over the term of the swap agreement 
this agreement matured on march  amounts received on the cash flow hedge interest rate swap were reclassified into earnings upon receipt of interest payments on the underlying loans  including million in and million in in  the bank entered into million of interest rate swaps that were scheduled to terminate in and could be terminated after two years at the election of the counterparty swaptions to mitigate risks associated with changes to the fair value of a like amount of fixed rate certificates of deposit five year cds that had similar call features 
for the first two years of the swaps  the bank was to receive interest at a weighted average fixed rate of and was to pay interest at a rate of libor less basis points 
if the swaps were not terminated in  then the bank would receive interest at a weighted average rate of and paid interest at a rate of libor less basis points for the last three years of the swap term 
all of these interest rate hedges were initially designated as fair value hedges against a like amount of five year cds and the bank expected a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the five year cds 
however  at december   there was a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the five year cds for only one group of five year cds with a principal amount of million and an unrealized gain of million 
the unrealized loss on the interest rate swaps and the unrealized gain on the million of five year cds have been recorded in income for the unrealized pre tax loss on the ineffective interest rates swaps at december   of  has been recorded in income for and the related unrealized gain on the five year cds with ineffective hedges was reversed from income as of december  for the year ended december   interest expense on certificates of deposit was reduced by million as a result of these interest rate swaps 
on january   the bank terminated these interest rates swaps by making a cash payment of  and recording a pre tax loss of  which reflected the increase in the fair value during in  the bank entered into million of interest rate swaps that were scheduled to terminate in and could be terminated after one year at the election of the counterparty to mitigate risks associated with changes to the fair value of a like amount of fixed rate certificates of deposit three year cds that had similar call features

all of these interest rate hedges were initially designated as fair value hedges against a like amount of three year cds and the bank expected a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the three year cds 
however  at december   the fair value of these interest rate swaps  which did not have a highly effective

for the initial term of the swaptions  the bank received interest at a weighted average fixed rate of and paid interest at a rate of libor less basis points 
if the swaptions were not terminated by the counterparty in  then the bank would receive interest at a weighted average rate of and pay interest at a rate of libor less basis points for the last two years of the swap term
