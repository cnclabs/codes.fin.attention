item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a 
general the primary objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of the wilber corporation and its subsidiary for each of the years in the three year period ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes presented in part ii  item  of this document 
our financial performance is heavily dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on our loans and investment securities less the interest paid on our deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  investment securities gains losses  service charges and penalty fees on deposit accounts  fees collected for trust and investment services  insurance commission income  the increase on the cash surrender value on bank owned life insurance  other service fees and other income 
our non interest expenses consist of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing  professional fees  other miscellaneous expenses and taxes 
results of operations are also influenced by general economic conditions particularly changes in interest rates  competitive conditions  government policies  changes in federal or state tax law  and the actions of our regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies 
management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
while management s current evaluation of the allowance for loan losses indicates that the allowance is adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the allowance would need to be increased 
for example  if historical loan loss experience significantly worsened or if current economic conditions significantly deteriorated  additional provisions for loan losses would be required to increase the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the assumptions and estimates used in the internal reviews of the company s non performing loans and potential problem loans have a significant impact on the overall analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management has concluded that the evaluation of collateral values was reasonable under the circumstances for each of the reported periods  if collateral valuations were significantly lowered the company s allowance for loan losses would also require an additional provision for loan losses 
our policy on the allowance for loan losses is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of the allowance for loan losses is included in part ii  item ca  of this document 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in note of the consolidated financial statements provided in part ii  item  of this document to obtain a better understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  management has not completed its evaluation of the impact of this standard  however  the company does not expect adoption of sfas to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the financial accounting standard s board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  postretirement benefits associated with split dollar life insurance 
eitf will require that the postretirement aspects of an endorsement type split dollar life insurance arrangement be recognized as a liability by the employer and that the obligation is not effectively settled by the purchase of life insurance 
companies adopting the eitf will be able to choose between retrospective application to all prior periods or treating the application of eitf as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings or to other components of equity or net assets in the balance sheet 
eitf will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we currently have sixteen split dollar life insurance arrangements with past  current and retired executives of the bank that will be subject to eitf we are currently evaluating the potential impact of eitf in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those years 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands the related disclosure requirements 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement 
k 
index in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no  accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of fin are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard 
tax positions must meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date in order for the related tax benefits to be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  this statement was issued to simplify the accounting for servicing rights and to reduce the volatility that results from using different measurement attributes 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which eliminates the exemption from applying sfas to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless of the form of the instruments 
sfas also allows the election of fair value measurement at acquisition  at issuance  or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a remeasurement event 
adoption is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after september  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

performance overview for period ended december  during several of our key performance measures decreased significantly  as compared to net income  earnings per share  return on assets  and return on equity all decreased between the periods ended december   and december  specifically  net income decreased from million in to million in  a thousand  or decrease 
earnings per share  return on assets  and return on equity decreased from   and  respectively  in  to   and  respectively  in throughout we operated in a difficult interest rate environment 
the treasury yield curve was flat to inverted throughout the year  a condition which reduced our ability to improve net interest income 
although we believe we managed our asset and liability portfolios effectively throughout  net interest income decreased thousand or between and we recorded net interest income of million in  as compared to million in non interest expense increased million or between and due to several factors  including significant increases in salaries expense  occupancy expense  professional fees and other miscellaneous expense 
we recorded approximately thousand of unanticipated non interest expense in due to fixed asset losses and recovery costs associated with a regional flood that impacted our primary market area during the second quarter 
two of our branch offices  namely our sidney  ny branch and our walton  ny branch  were severely damaged in the flood  causing us to operate from temporary banking facilities throughout the third and fourth quarter of the expenses associated with the flood principally affected our occupancy and other miscellaneous expense categories 
occupancy expense increased thousand or between and other miscellaneous expense increased thousand or between and professional fees also increased substantially between and we recorded professional fees of thousand in  as compared to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
during we incurred thousand of professional fees to execute a self tender offer for the company s common stock 
in addition  in we engaged a third party accounting and auditing firm to manage our internal audit function 
this increased our professional fees thousand between and salaries increased thousand or between periods  from million in to million in during we increased the base salaries for many of our existing employees  created several new positions due to our expansion efforts  recorded an increase in our executive deferred compensation expense  and increased incentive and commission payments for operating and sales staff 
the decrease in net interest income and increase in non interest expense were partially offset by an improvement in non interest income between the periods 
non interest income increased thousand or between and  k 
index from million in to million in the increase was principally driven by an increase in trust fees and other income 
during our total assets did not grow significantly 
specifically  total assets increased from million at december  to million at december   a million or increase 
the lack of significant asset growth can be attributed to a few factors  including  but not limited to  the lack of significant population growth in the markets we serve  the repayment of long term borrowings throughout and the execution of a self tender offer for the company s common stock during the second quarter 
between december  and december  some of our asset quality measures improved  while others worsened 
the level of non performing loans decreased from million or of loans outstanding at december  to million or of loans outstanding at december   a million or basis point decrease 
conversely  the level of potential problem loans increased from million or of loans outstanding at december  to million or of loans outstanding at december   a million increase 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing  but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower or related borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as non performing at some time in the future 
net loan charge offs increased from million in to million in during the first quarter of  we recorded charge offs totaling million 
this compares to thousand in net charge offs for the remaining three quarters of during the first quarter of  we recorded a thousand charge off on two loans to one of our large commercial borrowers 
we specifically allocated thousand in the allowance for loan losses for anticipated losses on these two loans to this borrower during prior periods 
the allowance for loan losses and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans did not change significantly between december  and december  the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total loans at december   as compared with million or of total loans at december  the company s management believes the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december   to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio

financial condition a 
comparison of financial condition at december   and december please refer to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item  of this document 
asset composition our assets are comprised of earning and non earning assets 
earning assets include our investment securities  loans  interest bearing deposits at other banks and federal funds sold 
non earning assets include our real estate and other assets acquired as the result of foreclosure  facilities  equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  non interest bearing deposits at other banks and cash 
we generally maintain to of our total assets in earning assets 
during the composition of our assets did not change significantly 
the total loans to total assets ratio was at december   as compared to at december  total assets during  our total assets increased slightly  from million at december   to million at december   a million or increase 
during we repaid maturing borrowings as they came due  which curbed growth in total assets 
throughout most of the yield curve was flat to inverted 
this interest rate environment reduced the bank s ability to earn spread on borrowed funds  which prompted management to repay rather than renew long term borrowings during in addition  during we repurchased  shares of our common stock into treasury 
this reduced total shareholders equity and total assets by million 
in spite of these decreases  total assets increased million between december  and december  due primarily to a million increase deposits and the related investment of those deposits into earning assets 
k 
index investment securities our investment securities portfolio consists of trading  available for sale  and held to maturity securities 
the following table summarizes our trading  available for sale  and held to maturity investment securities portfolio for the periods indicated 
summary of investment securities at december  amortized cost estimated fair value amortized cost estimated fair value amortized cost estimated fair value in thousands trading available for sale us treasuries obligations of us government corporations and agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds mortgage backed securities corporate bonds equity securities total available for sale held to maturity obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds mortgage backed securities total held to maturity these securities are held by the company for its non qualified executive deferred compensation plan 
between december  and december   our investment securities portfolio including trading  available for sale  and held to maturity increased thousand or 
during we received proceeds from sales and maturities of securities totaling million versus new purchases of million 
proceeds from the sale or maturity of the investment securities portfolio were generally used to purchase new investment securities 
we modestly decreased the level of available for sale investment securities and increased our holdings of held to maturity securities during to fully collateralize an increase in our municipal deposit liabilities 
during we continued to maintain a concentration in mortgage backed securities 
these include both mortgage pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
at the end of  our mortgage backed securities portfolio comprised of the carrying value of our investment securities portfolio 
this compares to and at the end of and  respectively 
although our mortgage backed securities are guaranteed by us government agencies  they are susceptible to prepayment risk 
in the event  residential mortgage interest rates were to drop significantly  the yield on our mortgage backed securities would also decline 
when mortgage rates are low  homeowners often refinance their existing mortgage loans or purchase new homes 
this increases the amount of principal payments we receive on our mortgage backed securities  which  in turn  increases the amount of net amortization expense we record as an offset to interest income  thereby decreasing the yield on the securities 
the estimated fair value of the investment portfolio is largely dependent upon the interest rate environment at the time the market price is determined 
as interest rates decline  the estimated fair value of bonds generally increases  and conversely  as interest rates increase  the estimated fair value of bonds generally decreases 
at december   the net unrealized loss on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million 
by comparison  at december   the net unrealized loss on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million 
although there was a slight increase in the level of interest rates between december  and december  and approximately million of investment securities portfolio turnover  the level of net unrealized loss on the available k 
index for sale investment securities portfolio did not change significantly due to a reduction in the aggregate balance of the portfolio 
the amortized cost of the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million at december  versus million at december  the net unrealized loss on the available for sale investment securities portfolio as a percent of the amortized cost was at december  versus at december the following table sets forth information regarding the carrying value  weighted average yields and anticipated principal repayments of the bank s investment securities portfolio as of december  all amortizing security principal payments  including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage pass through securities  are included based on their expected average lives 
callable securities  primarily callable agency securities  and municipal bonds are assumed to mature on their maturity date 
available for sale securities are shown at fair value 
held to maturity securities are shown at their amortized cost 
the yields on debt securities shown in the table below are calculated by dividing annual interest  including accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums  by the amortized cost of the securities at december  yields on obligations of states and municipalities exempt from federal taxation were not tax effected

this compares to years at december  these estimates were provided by a third party investment securities analyst and are used to provide comparisons with other companies in the banking industry 
the estimates were based upon the projected cash flows to the most likely call date of our investment securities portfolio taking into consideration the unique characteristics of the individual securities held by us 
our estimate may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to our concentration in mortgage backed securities 
the credit quality of our debt securities is strong 
at december   of the securities held in our available for sale and held to maturity investment securities portfolio were rated a or better by moody s credit rating services  were rated aaa 
this compares to and  respectively  for the period ended december  at december  we held million of equity securities including million in fhlbny stock  a million equity interest in a small business investment company  meridian venture partners ii  l 
p  thousand of common stock holdings of other banking institutions  thousand of federal reserve bank of new york stock  thousand in new york business development corporation stock  and thousand in a money market mutual fund 
by comparison  at december   equity securities totaled million at estimated fair value 
the decrease in the estimated fair value of equity securities between the periods totaling thousand was due to a thousand decrease in the common stock of other banking institutions primarily due the sale of securities during  a thousand return of capital on the bank s investment in meridian venture partners ii  lp  a thousand decrease in fhlbny stock due to a decrease in our capital stock requirements  and a thousand decrease in the money market mutual fund balance 
k 
index time deposits with other banks and federal funds sold at december  our time deposits with other banks and federal funds sold totaled million 
this compares to million at december  during  million of certificates of deposit we maintained at other financial institutions matured  decreasing our time deposit at other banks from million at december  to thousand at december  in the normal course of business  we sell and purchase federal funds to and from other banks to meet our daily liquidity needs 
because the funds are generally an unsecured obligation of the counter party  we only sell federal funds to well capitalized banks that carry strong credit ratings 
given the daily fluctuation in our federal funds sold position throughout the year  it is appropriate to compare the annual average federal funds sold positions rather than the positions at the end of the periods 
during our average federal funds sold position was million 
by comparison  during our average federal funds sold position was million 
loan portfolio general 
the total loan portfolio increased by million or during total loans outstanding at december   were million  as compared to million at december  although total loans did not grow significantly in  we continued to be aggressive in seeking out new loan opportunities  particularly for small business and commercial real estate loans in our new markets  including kingston  ny  syracuse  ny and binghamton  ny 
the following table summarizes the composition of our loan portfolio over the prior five year period 
distribution of loans table at december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total loans less allowance for loan losses net loans includes loans secured by family residential dwellings  family residential dwellings  home equity loans and residential construction loans 
includes commercial and industrial loans  agricultural loans and obligations other than securities and leases of states and political subdivisions in the united states during the prior five year period the composition of our loan portfolio has generally shifted from one with a modest concentration in residential real estate to one with a modest concentration in commercial real estate 
at december   commercial real estate loans comprised or million of our total loan portfolio 
this compares to or million at december  throughout the five year period covered in the table above  we concentrated our efforts on hiring commercial lenders in large  more densely populated markets  including johnson city  kingston and syracuse  new york 
during the same period  the yields on residential real estate loans were near historical lows 
although we continued to originate residential real estate loans throughout the five year period  we principally did so as an agent for a large super regional bank that could package the loans into investment securities and sell them into the secondary mortgage market 
in the first quarter of  we expect to acquire provantage funding corporation  a new york state licensed mortgage bank 
although we expect provantage to provide us access to small business and commercial real estate loan opportunities in the capital district of new york albany  schenectady and saratoga counties  we anticipate that our residential real estate loan portfolio will increase significantly in prior to our acquisition  provantage has originated between and million in residential real estate loans per annum  most of which we will retain for our own portfolio 
k 
index during our consumer loan portfolio decreased million or 
although we were successful in expanding our automobile dealer network in recent years in an effort to increase the volume of indirect automobile loans  higher interest rates and a reduced level of used automobile sales in our primary market have curbed loan demand 
at december   our indirect automobile loan portfolio was comprised of  accounts  totaling million 
this compares to  accounts and million at december   a net decrease in accounts and a net decrease in indirect automobile loan volume outstanding 
the following table sets forth the amount of loans maturing and repricing in our portfolio 
the full principal amount outstanding of adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which the interest rate is next scheduled to adjust 
similarly  the full principal amount outstanding of fixed rate loans are shown based on their final maturity date

commitments and lines of credit 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including bond financing and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
since most of the standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december  and december  standby letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and december  the fair value of the bank s standby letters of credit was not significant 
the following table summarizes the expirations of our standby letters of credit as of december  k 
index standby letters of credit expiration table commitment expiration of standby letters of credit dollars in thousands within one year after one but within three years after three but within five years five years or greater total in addition to standby letters of credit  we have issued lines of credit and other commitments to lend to our customers 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
these include home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans  commercial letters of credit  and other personal and commercial lines of credit 
at december  and december  we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments of million and million  respectively  representing a million or increase period over period 
the increase in the unfunded loan commitments was primarily due to growth in the unused portion of commercial lines of credit 
k 
index asset quality and risk elements general 
one of our key objectives is to maintain strong credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
the following narrative provides summary information and our experience regarding the quality and risk elements of our loan portfolio 
delinquent loans 
at december   we had million of loans that were or more days past due excluding non performing loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
by comparison  at december  we had million of loans that were or more days past due excluding non performing loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
the increase in delinquent loans between the periods was principally due to an increase in delinquency on a few large commercial real estate loans 
although the level of delinquent loans increased between december  and december   management considers the level of delinquent loans to be manageable and within its target level of less than of total loans outstanding 
non accrual  past due and restructured loans 
the following chart sets forth information regarding non performing assets for the periods stated 
table of non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands loans in non accrual status residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total non accruing loans loans contractually past due days or more and still accruing interest troubled debt restructured loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans includes loans secured by family residential dwellings  family residential dwellings  home equity loans and residential construction loans 
includes commercial and industrial loans  agricultural loans and obligations other than securities and leases of states and political subdivisions in the united states 
total non performing loans  including non accruing loans  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  and troubled debt restructured loans decreased million between december  and december   from million to million 
during the first quarter of  a million commercial real estate loan in non accrual status was paid off in full by a related party of the borrower 
in addition  during the first quarter of  an thousand loan  previously recorded as a troubled debt restructured loan  was removed from troubled debt status 
at december   the loan was performing and yielding a market rate 
and finally  during the first quarter  we charged off a thousand loan to one of our large commercial borrowers  which was previously on non accrual status 
the decrease in non performing loans was offset by the addition of six commercial real estate loans totaling million  two residential real estate loans totaling thousand and one commercial loan with a thousand balance being placed on non accrual status during other real estate owned and repossessed assets 
other real estate owned oreo consists of properties formerly pledged as collateral on loans  which have been acquired by us through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
oreo is carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the real estate  less estimated costs to sell 
at both december  and december  we held insignificant amounts of oreo property totaling thousand at december  and thousand at december  k 
index potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing  but where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as non performing at some time in the future 
potential problem loans are typically loans classified by our loan rating system as substandard 
potential problem loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a rating upgrade of loans previously classified as substandard or a rating downgrade of loans previously carried in a higher credit classification 
in addition  we hold an amount of commercial and commercial real estate loans with balances in excess of million 
we have identified through normal credit review procedures potential problem loans totaling million or of total loans outstanding at december  by comparison  at december   potential problem loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding 
the increase in potential problem loans from the period ended december  to the period ended december   was primarily due to a decline in the financial condition of several large commercial borrowers during management cannot predict economic conditions or other factors which may impact each potential problem loan 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on non accrual status  become restructured  or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses 
loan concentrations 
we classify our loan portfolio by industry to determine and monitor the level of our loan concentrations 
we generally consider industry concentrations when the total loan obligation outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments to the industry exceeds of the company s capital 
at december  this was approximately million 
we also review geographic concentration and economic trends within each industry concentration to further segment and analyze the risk 
the following narrative summarizes our concentrations of credit 
at december  we had one hundred ten loans to companies in the manufacturing sector with total loan obligations of million 
nine of the borrowers in this sector have aggregate credit facilities in excess of million  totaling approximately million 
nine of the credit facilities provided to businesses within the manufacturing industry have either been placed on non accrual status  identified as a potential problem loan  or identified as a special mention loan requiring special monitoring 
for this reason we have increased our monitoring efforts of borrowers in the manufacturing sector by requiring semi annual or more frequent in some cases credit performance reviews 
at december  we had million of total loan obligations secured by commercial rental properties or to commercial real estate developers 
we have eight borrowers within this area of concentration with total loan obligations in excess of million 
the aggregate amount of loans outstanding to these eight borrowers at december  was approximately million 
all of these loans were in compliance with contractual payment terms at december  the remaining portfolio was comprised of approximately eighty loans and spread amongst a diverse group of properties and borrowers 
at december  we had million of total loan obligations secured by residential rental properties 
there are approximately loans in this portfolio with an average loan size of thousand 
criticized loans within this portfolio total approximately million to four borrowers and include two relationships that are secured by mobile home parks 
the geographic location of this portfolio is diverse 
at december  we had outstanding million of total loans obligations to borrowers who operate in the hotel motel industry 
there are forty four loans to the hotel motel industry with ten relationships exceeding million 
the hotel motel properties that we finance are geographically dispersed throughout our market area and the broader statewide region 
all of these loans were performing at december  at december  we had million of total loan obligations automotive and other vehicle dealerships 
these obligations are comprised of about twenty borrowers  including eight borrowers with dealer floor plan lines totaling million 
due to the significant risk posed by dealer floor plan lending  management monitors the dealer floor plan loans by conducting inventory reviews on a monthly basis 
at december   there were two criticized borrowers within this area of industry concentration with million in aggregate obligations

the allowance for loan losses at december  was million or of gross loans outstanding 
this compares to million or of loans outstanding at december  during  net charge offs on loans totaled million 
this compares to million of net charge offs in  a thousand or net increase between the periods 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a thousand charge off on two loans to one of our large commercial borrowers 
prior to the first quarter of  we allocated thousand in the allowance for loan losses for the potential losses on these loans due to the weakened financial condition of the borrower 
during the first quarter of  we determined that a significant portion of the gross loans outstanding to this borrower were non collectible  and therefore  charged off thousand to the allowance for loan losses 
we recorded million in the provision for loan losses during this compares to million in  a thousand or decrease 
the provision for loan losses did not change significantly between the periods due to the improvement of some credit quality factors offset by the deterioration of others 
in particular  during we experienced a significant increase in potential problem loans and delinquency 
this was offset by a decrease in non performing loans and a reduction in net charge offs during the last three quarters of the year 
management and the board of directors deemed the allowance for loan losses as adequate at december  and december  allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
we allocate our allowance for loan losses among the loan categories indicated in the following table 
this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future charge offs  ii likely proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories  or iii likely amounts of future charge offs 
additionally  since management regards the allowance for loan losses as a general balance  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories

other non earning assets and bank owned life insurance cash and due from banks 
in order to operate the bank on a daily basis  it is necessary for us to maintain a limited amount of cash at our teller stations and within our vaults and atms to meet customers demands 
in addition  we always maintain an amount of check and other presentment items in the process of collection or float 
we are also required to maintain a clearing reserve balance at the federal reserve bank of new york and minimum target balances at our correspondent banks 
at december   we maintained million or of total assets in these categories of non earning assets 
this compares to million or of total assets at december  premises and equipment 
the net book value of premises and equipment decreased thousand or  from million at december   to million at december  during the fourth quarter of  we sold our norwich town branch building and equipment to the landowner and building tenant  pursuant to a buy out option in the master lease agreement with the landowner  which reduced premises and equipment net by thousand 
bank owned life insurance 
the cash surrender value of the life insurance at december  was million  as compared to million at december  the increase was attributable to an increase in the cash surrender value of the policies between the periods totaling thousand 
the policies are issued by four life insurance companies who all carry strong financial strength ratings 
the policies are issued on the lives of the bank s senior management

other assets decreased by thousand or  from million at december  to million at december  other assets are comprised of other real estate owned  interest receivable  prepaid dealer reserve  pension plan asset  computer software  net deferred tax assets  deferred taxes on investment securities  other assets  other prepaid items  and other accounts receivable 
several factors contributed to the net decrease in other assets between the periods 
however  the largest contributing factor to the net decrease in other assets was the k 
index significant decrease in our pension asset 
under new accounting standards effective in the fourth quarter of  for public companies  the wilber corporation was required to recognize previously unrecognized portions of their pension obligations through the balance sheet 
the net impact of this new accounting standard was a net reduction in our other assets totaling thousand

at december  deposits represented of our total liabilities  compared to at december  at december  our total deposits were million 
this compares to million at december   a million or increase 
the increase in total deposits between december  and december  was primarily attributable to a million net increase in our certificates of deposit over

summary 
net income for was million 
this was thousand or less than net income of million 
earnings per share were in  as compared to in  a decrease between the periods 
our return on average assets declined from in to in similarly  our return on average shareholders equity also declined from in to in a decrease in net interest income and an increase in non interest expense were partially offset by a slight decrease in the provision for loan losses  an increase in non interest income and a decrease in income taxes between the periods 
throughout the yield curve was flat to inverted 
this poor interest rate climate made it difficult for us to increase net interest income  particularly when earning assets were not growing significantly 
like most community banks  our bank earns some portion of its income by mismatching short term liabilities with longer term earning assets 
our net interest income decreased thousand or  from million in to million in during  the yield on our loan portfolio increased significantly as our variable rate loans repriced at higher interest rates due to increases in short term interest rates during the first half of the year 
the increase in loan yields was offset by significant increases in interest expense on time and other deposit accounts and money market accounts 
the increase in short term interest rates drove up the cost of time accounts  particularly certificates of deposit  and caused a shift of non maturity deposit balances from low cost savings and now accounts to higher cost money market accounts 
between and  interest income on loans increased million  while the interest expense on money market and time and other deposit accounts increased million 
during non interest expense increased significantly 
we incurred million of non interest expense in  as compared to million in  a million or increase 
during the second quarter of our market area was affected by a regional flood  which substantially damaged two of our branch offices  namely our sidney  new york and walton  new york branch offices 
the damages  related clean up and recovery charges caused us to record approximately thousand of unanticipated non interest expense 
salaries expense increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase 
in we raised employee salaries and commission payments for additional responsibilities and performance 
we also increased staff to meet our regulatory compliance obligations and satisfy our expansion efforts 
professional fees also increased significantly between the periods  from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
the company s common stock self tender offer in the second quarter of and the outsourcing of our internal audit function were the primary contributors to the increase 
the negative impact of a poor interest rate environment  the regional flood and the increase in salaries expense  was partially mitigated by an increase in non interest income 
non interest income increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase 
the increase was attributable to several factors  including a thousand increase in trust fees and a thousand increase in other income between the periods 
the decrease in income before tax between and reduced income tax expense 
we recorded million of income taxes in  versus million in a thousand or decrease 
net interest income 
net interest income is our most significant source of net revenue net interest income plus non interest income

the net interest margin  also known as the net yield on average interest earning assets  represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
between and  net interest income decreased thousand or 
this decrease was due to a significant increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities principally deposit funding offset  in part  by increases in interest income on earning assets principally loans 
k 
index in june the federal open market committee raised the target federal funds rate from to 
this represented the seventeenth consecutive basis point increase in the target federal funds rate over a year period 
these actions  coupled with modest inflation expectations and a strong international appetite for us treasury securities resulted in a very flat and at times inverted yield curve throughout  an interest rate environment which made it difficult for us to maintain or improve net interest margin 
historically  a portion of our net interest income has been earned from mismatching long term earning assets with short term interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  the higher interest rates during curbed the demand for new loans  which limited our ability to improve interest income 
average loans outstanding increased only modestly between and specifically  average loans outstanding increased million or between the periods  from million in to million in between and  total interest and dividend income increased million or  from million in to million in most of the increase was due to an increase in the average yield on loans 
between and  the weighted average yield on the loan portfolio increased basis points  from to 
this contributed million of additional interest income between comparable periods 
this represents of the net increase in interest income between and during and  the prime rate  the primary index rate for our variable rate loans  increased significantly 
at january   the prime rate was  as compared to at december   a basis point increase during the two year period 
the increase in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  between the periods also increased our average yield on federal funds sold from in to in and our average yield on our investment securities portfolio from in to in the increase in the federal funds interest rate and the shorter average maturity on our deposit liabilities prompted us to increase the amount of federal funds sold during we maintained million of average federal funds sold in  as compared to million in the net increase in interest income due to a higher federal funds rate and improved investment securities yields contributed an additional thousand of interest income between the periods 
interest income on federal funds sold increased thousand between the periods  from thousand in to thousand in  while interest income on our securities portfolio increased thousand  from million in to million in these increases in interest income were offset by a decrease in the average volume and average yield on interest bearing deposits held at other banks 
during and  we had several certificates of deposit at other financial institutions mature 
this caused a decrease in the average balance and average rate in this category of earning assets from million and in to million and in  respectively 
although there was a modest decrease in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities between and  the shift from lower cost deposits to higher cost deposits raised the average cost of interest bearing liabilities from in to in and increased interest expense million or 
interest expense for was million  as compared to million in between the comparable periods and there was a general increase in the level of interest rates 
this prompted us  as well as our competitors  to raise the interest rate paid on interest bearing deposit accounts  particularly the more interest sensitive deposit accounts  such as money market accounts and time accounts 
between the periods we recorded a million net increase in the cost of interest bearing deposit liabilities due to increase in interest rates 
in addition  due to the higher interest rates  our customers increased the amount of deposits held in money market and time and other deposit accounts 
the increased volume in these accounts contributed an additional million of interest expense between comparable periods 
the flat to inverted yield curve that persisted throughout effectively eliminated wholesale leverage opportunities and reduced the economic benefit of borrowing funds throughout the year  causing us to reduce borrowings and  in turn  our earning assets 
during our total borrowings averaged million 
this compares to average borrowings of million during  a million or decrease between the periods 
the decrease in average borrowings  offset by an increase in borrowing rates  resulted in a net decrease in interest expense on borrowings of thousand between the periods 
at december  the treasury yield curve was slightly inverted 
the day treasury bill was yielding and the year treasury note was yielding 
this interest rate environment inhibits our ability to earn net interest income  since banks typically earn net interest income by procuring short term deposits and borrowings and investing those proceeds in longer term loans and investments 
this practice  which is sometimes referred to as mismatching assets and liabilities  typically allows banks to enhance their interest spread  which generates net interest income 
if this interest rate environment persists  it may negatively impact our ability to increase net interest income for several quarters prospectively

k 
index net interest income was million in this compares to million in  a thousand or decrease between comparable periods 
although the decrease in net interest income between comparable periods was not drastic  several components of interest income and interest expense changed significantly between the periods due to both rate and volume factors 
interest income increased million between the periods due principally to an increase in the rate on earning assets 
as interest rates rose between and the yield on federal funds sold  securities  and loans all increased 
together  the rate improvement on these three categories of earning assets contributed an additional million of interest income between comparable periods 
this was offset by a thousand decrease in interest income on interest bearing deposits due to a change in rate between the periods 
between and the average yield on our loan portfolio increased basis points  from in to in this increase contributed million of additional interest income during or of the total increase in interest income due to rate between the periods 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate 
as the prime rate increased during and the first six month of  the yield on our variable rate loan portfolio climbed 
the million net improvement in interest income on earning assets due to a change in rate between the periods was offset  in part  by a thousand net reduction in interest income due to a decrease in the average volume of earning assets 
during  our average earning assets were million  which compares to million during the average volume of interest bearing deposits and securities decreased between the comparable periods  while the average volume of federal funds sold and loans increased slightly 
the decrease in the average volume of interest bearing deposits and securities reduced interest income by thousand between comparable periods 
this was offset  in part  by a thousand increase in interest income between comparable periods due to an increase in the average volume of federal fund sold and loans outstanding 
the million increase in interest income between and was offset by a million increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  million due to the increase in rate and thousand due to the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities 
the interest expense recorded on our most interest sensitive liabilities  including time and other deposits accounts and money market accounts  increased due to both an increase in volume and an increase in rate 
specifically  interest expense on time and other deposit accounts and interest expense on money market accounts increased million and million  respectively  over the comparable periods 
between the comparable periods  we raised the interest rates paid on our certificates of deposit to remain competitive within our market 
this drove up the cost of time and other deposit accounts resulting in a million increase in interest expense due to changes in rate 
the remaining increase in interest expense on time and other deposit accounts between the periods totaling thousand was due to an increase in volume as depositors transferred their monies from low rate interest bearing deposit or demand deposit accounts to higher yield certificates of deposit 
money market accounts experienced similar results 
as interest rates increased between the periods  we raised the interest rates paid on our money market deposits  which increased interest expense thousand on a comparable period basis 
the higher interest rates attracted additional deposits  which resulted in an increase in interest expense due to a change in volume of thousand 
the average cost of our money market deposit accounts increased basis points between comparable periods  from in to in  while the average volume of money market deposit accounts increased from million to million over the same periods 
as short term interest rates increased rapidly between the periods  we only modestly increased the interest rate on our now account deposits 
this caused some of our customers with now account deposits to either move their monies to another institution or transfer their now account funds to a higher rate deposit account 
this decreased the average volume of now accounts between the periods from million in to million in the decrease in the average volume of now account deposits reduced interest expense by thousand between comparable periods 
this was offset  however  by a thousand increase in interest expense on now account deposits due to a basis point increase in the average rate paid between the periods 
in spite of rising interest rates between periods  we modestly reduced the average rate paid on our savings accounts from in to in the low interest rate being offered on savings accounts caused depositors to reduce their savings deposits and decreased the average volume of savings deposits between the periods 
the interest expense recorded on savings accounts decreased thousand between and  thousand due to a decrease in average volume and thousand due to a decrease in rate 
the interest expense on borrowings decreased thousand between and due principally to the repayment of borrowed funds 
between the comparable periods  the average volume of borrowings decreased by million  resulting in a thousand decrease in interest expense due to changes in volume 
this was offset  in part  by a thousand increase in interest expense on borrowings between comparable periods due to higher interest rates 
k 
index provision for loan losses 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million in  as compared to million in  a thousand decrease 
during some of our credit quality measures worsened  while others improved 
in particular  between the periods we experienced a significant increase in potential problem loans 
during the first quarter of  we downgraded some of our large commercial credits  which increased the level of potential problem loans from million or of loans outstanding at december  to million or of loans outstanding at march  at december  this level remained high at million or of loans outstanding 
in addition  loans to days delinquent totaled million or of loans outstanding at december  this increased to million or of loans outstanding at december  additional increases in the provision for loan losses were mitigated by a decrease in non performing loans between december  and december  and a declining level of net charge offs during the last three quarters of non performing loans decreased from million or of loans outstanding at december  to million or of loans outstanding at december  although net charge offs increased thousand or between comparable twelve month periods  the trend during the last three quarters of were favorable 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a thousand charge off of one borrower s loans with us  for which an allowance for loan losses had been previously allocated 
this comprised of our net charge offs 
during the last three quarters of  we recorded net charge offs of thousand 
this compares to million of net charge offs during the last three quarters of non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  commissions income  investment security gains losses  income on bank owned life insurance  other service fees  and other income 
non interest income increased thousand or in  from million in to million in the net increase in non interest income on a comparable period basis was due to net increases in trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  net investment securities gains  bank owned life insurance income and other income  offset  in part  by a decrease in commission income and other services fees 
trust fees increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase between the periods 
during  executor and account closing fees increased thousand or due to the closing of several large estates and accounts 
executor and account closing fees totaled thousand in  as compared to thousand in fees on retained trust  investment management and custodial accounts remained relatively unchanged year over year 
during we recorded million of service charges on deposit accounts 
this compares to million during  a thousand or increase 
during the third quarter of we reduced or eliminated select demand deposit and now account service charges to retain and attract new transaction accounts 
the decrease in service fees on these accounts between comparable periods was offset by a thousand increase in atm fees between the comparable periods 
during we raised the fee we charge non customers to use our atm network 
the increase in this fee was the primary reason our atm fees increased during during we recognized net investment securities gains of thousand 
this compares to thousand during  a thousand or increase between the periods 
the increase in net investment securities gains between the periods was due to two factors an thousand increase in gains of trading securities  offset by a thousand decrease in gains on the sale and maturity of available for sale investment securities 
during we recorded a net gain of thousand on our trading securities portfolio 
this compares to a thousand net gain in our trading securities portfolio consists of equity and debt securities held for the company s executive deferred compensation plan 
the securities held by this plan performed better in than in during we received proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale investment securities totaling million 
this generated net investment securities gains of thousand 
by comparison  during we received proceeds from the sale and maturity of available for sale investment securities totaling million  which generated net investment securities gains of thousand 
we hold life insurance policies on the lives of sixteen active and former executives of the company 
the cash surrender value of these policies totaled million at december  although we did not purchase any additional policies in  the income on these policies increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase due to a modest increase in the net crediting amount provided by our insurance carriers 
other income is comprised of numerous types of fee income  including investment services  lease income  safe deposit box income  title insurance agency income  rental of bank real estate  and distributions from two insurance trusts  in which the bank participates 
other income increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand k 
index or increase 
the increase between the periods was due to several factors 
in the second quarter of  we recorded thousand of other income due to the unanticipated recovery on a defaulted investment security 
between comparable periods we recorded a thousand increase in investment services income due to increased investment service sales 
during the third quarter of  we sold a small parcel of land and house adjacent to one of our branch offices generating a thousand gain on the sale 
and finally  during the fourth quarter we received a thousand net incentive payment from our atm network provider to convert our atm network 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in certain components of other income  including a thousand decrease in rental income and a thousand decrease in income from a title insurance agency in which we hold an ownership interest 
other service fees are comprised of numerous types of fee income including merchant credit card processing fees  residential mortgage commissions  official check and check cashing fees  travelers check sales  wire transfer fees  letter of credit fees  and other miscellaneous service charges commissions and fees 
other service fees decreased thousand or between and the decrease in other service fees between the periods was principally due to the decrease in residential mortgage commissions 
we originate residential mortgage loans as an agent for a super regional bank located in the southeastern united states 
during the regional housing market slowed and mortgage interest rates increased 
due to these factors we originated less mortgages under our agency arrangement during  as compared to as a result  during we recorded thousand of residential mortgage commissions  as compared to thousand in  a thousand or decrease 
our commission income is generated from the bank s insurance agency subsidiary  mang wilber llc 
during we recorded thousand of commission income 
this compares to thousand in an increase in commission income from our oneonta  new york and walton  new york locations was offset by a significant decrease in commission income from our specialty lines agency located in clifton park  new york 
non interest expense 
non interest expense is comprised of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing expense  professional fees  and other miscellaneous expense 
total non interest expense increased million or on a comparable period basis  from million in to million in between comparable periods  most categories of non interest expense increased with the exception of employee benefits cost and advertising and marketing expense 
salaries expense increased thousand or between the comparable periods  from million in to million in the increase between periods was due to increases in all three components of salary expense  namely base salaries and overtime  commission and incentive amounts and deferred compensation expense 
base salaries and overtime increased thousand or between the periods  from million in to million in  due to an increase in staff and general increases in base salary amounts 
commission and incentive payments increased thousand between the periods  from thousand in to thousand in and finally  the salaries expense related to the company s executive deferred compensation plan increased thousand between the periods  from thousand in to thousand in due principally to the improved performance of the investments held for the benefit of the deferred compensation accounts 
we recorded employee benefits expense of million in this compares to million in the net decrease in employee benefits expense between comparable periods totaling thousand or  was due to several factors 
in the first quarter of  we froze our defined benefit pension plan and began making employer contributions to our k retirement plan 
due principally to the curtailment charge on the frozen defined benefit plan  we recorded a net increase in retirement benefits expense defined benefit pension expense and k retirement expense of thousand between comparable periods 
retirement benefits expense increased from thousand in to thousand in fica expense  group life insurance  group disability insurance  unemployment insurance  workers compensation and employee education expense each increased between comparable periods  combining for an additional thousand of benefits expense 
the increase in these costs were offset by a thousand decrease in other benefits due  principally  to a reduction in the amount recorded to fund the company s supplemental executive retirement plan for two retired executives 
in addition  our group health insurance expense decreased thousand between comparable periods due to favorable claims experience 
occupancy expense increased thousand or between and occupancy expense totaled million in  as compared to million in the increase was substantially due to a regional flood  which caused us to temporarily close our walton and sidney  new york branch offices  while a third office  our main office  was modestly damaged due to water intrusion 
we incurred significant costs in to clean up each of these offices 
in addition  we entered into two lease agreements with a third party  to rent bank in a box temporary banking facilities in the walton and sidney markets 
k 
index computer service fees increased thousand or between and we recorded thousand of computer service fees in  as compared to thousand in the increase between the periods can be primarily attributed to a core computer system conversion completed during the third quarter of we converted our proprietary core computer operating system to a system more widely used throughout the banking industry 
to operate the new system we entered into various software licensing agreements and maintenance contracts with several hardware and software computer system vendors  resulting in an increase in computer service fees 
furniture and equipment expense also increased thousand or between periods  from thousand in to thousand in the increase was primarily due to an increase in expenditures on computer equipment related to the core system conversion 
professional fees increased thousand or between comparable periods  from thousand in to thousand in the increase in professional fees was due to a couple of significant factors 
in april we announced a self tender offer for the company s common stock 
to complete the offer we recorded thousand of legal and other professional fees 
in addition  in we engaged a regional accounting firm to perform our internal audit function 
this increased professional fees thousand over comparable periods 
these increases were reduced by a thousand net decrease in other components of legal and professional fees

in net interest income increased thousand 
this was principally due to an increase in both the volume and the yield on the loan portfolio 
this improvement was offset by a million increase in non interest expense 
in we incurred significant increases in most components of non interest expense due to expansion activities  the core computer system conversion  and significant regulatory compliance efforts  including sarbanes oxley act compliance and bank secrecy act anti money laundering compliance 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded thousand in the provision for loan losses to increase the allowance for loan losses to a level that reflected the estimated embedded losses in the portfolio 
the substantial increase in the provision for loan losses during the fourth quarter of was principally due to the significant decline in the financial condition of one of our large commercial borrowers and increase in net charge offs 
in we recorded million of investment securities gains due principally to the sale of million of available for sale investment securities 
low interest rates through the period allowed us to sell investment securities at substantial gains to their book value 
during interest rates increased  which reduced the level of investment securities gains on available for sale securities 
as a result  during we sold million of available for sale investment securities and recorded thousand of net investment securities gains 
our return on average assets declined from in to in similarly  our return on average shareholders equity also declined from in to in in average assets and average shareholders equity increased  while net income declined  resulting in a lower return on average assets and lower return on average equity

this compares to and  respectively  for the asset and yield summary table  rate and volume table in item da above  the comparative interest rate table that follows  and the associated narrative provide detailed net interest income information and analysis that are important to understanding our results of operations 
net interest income increased thousand or in during national interest rates increased see comparative interest rate table below for an quarter history of interest rates 
these changes  particularly the changes to the national prime rate of interest eight basis point increases totaling basis points  helped increase the average yield on loans from in to in during we maintained approximately million in variable rate loans 
the substantial majority of these variable rate loans were indexed to the national prime rate  which contributed to the improved yield on these assets 
the interest income on our loan portfolio increased from million in to million in  a million or increase 
also during the year  we increased the average dollar volume of loans outstanding through our loan production efforts and the acquisition of two hsbc bank usa  n 
a branch offices hsbc 
during our loans outstanding averaged million  as compared to million during  a million or increase 
in addition to increases in interest income on loans  during we recorded an increase in the interest income on our investment securities 
although our average volume of securities decreased during  as loans grew and we repaid borrowings  we recorded a thousand increase in interest income on securities over during  due to the very low interest rate environment  we recorded million in net amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investments 
this decreased to million in within our investment securities portfolio  we maintained a concentration of mortgage backed securities 
many of these securities were purchased at premiums to their par value 
as homeowners refinanced and prepaid their mortgages during due to the low interest rate environment  we received prepayments on these securities  which required us to record substantial amounts of amortization on the premiums 
during the level of homeowner refinancing decreased due to higher residential mortgage interest rates  resulting in a decrease in the amount of amortization recorded on this portfolio 
our yield on investment securities was in  versus in k 
index the rising interest rate environment during and the hsbc branch office acquisition substantially increased the interest expense on our most interest rate sensitive deposits  namely money market and time and other deposit accounts 
during the interest expense on these two categories of deposits increased million  from million in to million in throughout our competitors raised their deposit interest rates due to the higher national interest rate environment 
to remain competitive and retain our customer s deposit accounts  we also raised our deposit rates 
this rate increase  coupled with the hsbc branch acquisition and slight increases in less interest sensitive savings and now account interest rates  our total cost of interest bearing liabilities increased from in to in  a basis point increase 
at december  the treasury yield curve was very flat 
the six month treasury bill was yielding and the ten year treasury notes were yielding 
this flat interest rate environment inhibited our ability to earn net interest income  since banks typically earn net interest income by procuring short term deposits and borrowings and investing those proceeds in longer term loans and investments 
this practice  which is sometimes referred to as mismatching assets and liabilities  typically allows banks to enhance their interest spread  which generates net interest income

as mentioned above  we maintained an average variable rate loan portfolio of approximately million throughout as interest rates climbed during the interest rates and resultant yields on these loans increased 
in addition  during as loans matured or were repaid  they were replaced by new loans at higher rates of interest 
due to these factors  the amount of interest income recorded on loans due to changes in rate contributed an additional million to interest income between and the increase in the average volume of loans outstanding between and due to our hsbc branch acquisition and our loan production efforts contributed an additional million toward interest income between the periods 
during we recorded million of interest income on investment securities  as compared to million during  a thousand increase 
during  the yield on the investment securities portfolio improved primarily because we recorded a decrease in the net amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investments between the periods 
the increase in interest income on investment securities between the periods due to rate was thousand 
this was offset by a thousand decrease in interest income on investments securities due to a decrease in the average volume of investment securities outstanding between the periods 
during we recorded thousand of interest income from interest bearing deposits held at other banks 
this compares with thousand in  an thousand decrease 
during the course of and  million of fdic insured certificates of deposit that were originally acquired during and in connection with an interest rate arbitrage wholesale leverage strategy matured 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of we acquired million of fdic insured certificates of deposit as part of a wholesale leverage strategy consummated in connection with the k 
index hsbc branch acquisition 
the certificates of deposit acquired in the fourth quarter of were acquired at a much lower rate of interest than the certificates that had matured in connection with the interest arbitrage wholesale leverage strategy 
these activities resulted in a thousand decrease in interest income due to rate and a thousand increase in interest income due to an increase in the average volume between the periods 
during we maintained an average balance in our federal funds sold account of million  compared to million during in addition  throughout and the federal open market committee raised the target federal funds rate by basis points thirteen basis point increases 
due to these changes  interest income on federal funds sold increased thousand between and  thousand due to an increase in rate and thousand due to the increase in volume of federal funds sold 
during the interest expense on all categories of our interest bearing deposits increased relative to the most significant increases between the periods were recorded on our most interest sensitive deposits  namely time and other deposit accounts and money market accounts 
this was due to both the rapidly rising short term interest rates throughout both periods and the hsbc branch acquisition consummated during the first quarter of the total increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits due to rate was million 
this compares to a net increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits due to volume of thousand 
between the periods  the average volume of savings  money market  and time accounts increased  while the average volume of now accounts decreased 
the decrease in now account volumes was principally due to a decrease in deposit balances in our electronic money management account  a consumer oriented deposit account 
the increase in the average volume of savings  money market and time accounts was principally due to the hsbc branch acquisition 
the total interest expense on our borrowings decreased from million in to million in  a thousand decrease 
during we repaid million of long term borrowings 
most of these borrowings were borrowed in periods when borrowing costs were greater than the rates that prevailed during although we re borrowed million of long term borrowings during  the rates of interest on these borrowings were lower than the rates of borrowings we repaid 
provision for loan losses 
during we recorded a provision for loan losses of million  or of average total loans outstanding  compares to million  or of average total loans outstanding in the increase was due to a decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio between periods 
during  net loan charge offs increased thousand or  from thousand or of average total loans outstanding in to million or of average total loans outstanding in similarly  during we experienced an increase in the level of our non performing loans 
at december  we had million of non performing loans outstanding versus million at december  this was a million or increase between the periods 
non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  commission income  investment security gains losses  income on bank owned life insurance  other service fees  and other income 
non interest income decreased modestly from million in to million in this represents a thousand or decrease 
increases in trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  other service fees  and other income  were negatively offset by a significant decrease in net investment security gains  a modest decrease in commission income and a slight decrease in bank owned life insurance income 
total trust fees increased during specifically  during we recorded total trust fees of million  as compared to million in  a thousand or increase 
the increase in trust fees between the periods was due to an increase in non recurring estate administration commissions and trust account termination fees  as well as an increase in general service fees on trust  custodial  and investment management accounts 
during we revised our trust account fee schedule 
accordingly  the increased fees imposed by the revised fee schedule impacted all of  as opposed to only a portion of fiscal in we recorded thousand in trust estate closing fees  as compared to thousand in service charges on deposit accounts increased from million in to million in  a thousand or increase 
during the second half of  we increased certain penalty charges on checking accounts  the impact of which was recognized for the full year of versus only for a portion of in addition  due to the hsbc branch acquisition in the first quarter of  the number of demand deposit accounts upon which we were able to assess service charges increased year over year 
our commission income is generated from the bank s insurance agency subsidiary  mang wilber llc 
during we recorded thousand of commission income  as compared to thousand in  a thousand or decrease 
during our agency did not renew coverage on several large commercial property and casualty insurance accounts due to competitive factors 
in addition  the agency s personal lines property and casualty book of business did not grow substantially between periods 
these two factors resulted in a net decrease in commission income 
k 
index during  we recognized net pre tax investment securities gains of thousand 
this was a thousand or decrease  as compared to  when we recorded million in net pre tax investment securities gains 
during we sold million of available for sale investment securities and an additional million in available for sale and held to maturity securities matured or were called 
by comparison  during we sold million of available for sale investment securities and had an additional in available for sale and held to maturity securities mature or be called 
the principal cash flows from matured  called  and sold investment securities and the realized gains generated from those principal cash flows were greater in than in due to historically low interest rates experienced during the income related to the increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance decreased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or decrease 
during the insurance companies that underwrote our bank owned life insurance decreased the crediting rates to their policyholders because the yields on their investment securities portfolios generally declined during and as a result of the low interest rate environment 
other service fees are comprised of numerous types of fee income  including merchant credit card processing fees  residential mortgage commissions  official check and check cashing fees  travelers check sales  wire transfer fees  letter of credit fees  and other miscellaneous service charges  commissions  and fees 
other service fees increased substantially year over year 
during we recorded thousand in other service fees  versus thousand in  a thousand or increase 
the substantial majority of the increase in other services fees in was due to a substantial increase in mortgage commission income year over year 
during we increased our marketing efforts and streamlined our mortgage origination process to increase the volume of mortgages we originate as agent for a large regional bank based in the southeast 
these efforts  coupled with the low mortgage rates prevalent during most of  increased our mortgage origination fees by thousand  from thousand in to thousand in other income is comprised of numerous types of fee income  including investment services  lease income  safe deposit box income  title insurance agency income  rental of foreclosed real estate  and distributions from two insurance trusts  in which the bank participates 
other income increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
during  we recorded thousand of investment services income  as compared to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
during  we hired a financial planning and investment management specialist and licensed eight additional employees to sell investment services 
the fee income improvements experienced in were the result of additional mutual fund  annuity  and investment securities sales generated by these employees 
in addition  during we recorded a thousand increase in other income due to the improved performance in a title insurance agency in which we hold an ownership interest 
during we recorded thousand of other income due to the title agency  as compared to thousand in this improvement was offset by a thousand decrease in the amount distributed from a credit life insurance trust in which we participate through our membership in the new york bankers association 
during we received a thousand distribution from this credit life insurance trust  versus thousand in non interest expense 
non interest expense is comprised of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing expense  professional fees  and other expense 
total non interest expense increased from million in to million in  a million or increase 
during  we acquired two branch offices from hsbc  opened a loan production office in syracuse  new york  converted our core computer operating system  and completed significant compliance related projects  including documenting and testing our internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the sarbanes oxley act section 
these efforts resulted in significant increases in several categories of non interest expense 
salaries expense increased significantly in total salaries expense in was million versus million in  a thousand or increase 
the thousand increase between periods was due to several factors 
to service the accounts acquired from hsbc we increased our teller and customer service staff by ten full time employees 
during the second quarter of we opened a loan production office in syracuse  new york  and hired two additional staff members 
in addition  throughout and we provided salary increases to various members of the company s staff for merit and cost of living purposes 
and finally  due to our core computer system conversion and our sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts  we recorded thousand in increased overtime wages 
these increases were partially offset by a thousand reduction in salaries expense related to the company s profit sharing incentive and commission plans 
in employee benefits expense increased thousand or  from million in to million in although various components of benefits expense changed year over year  the increase was primarily attributable to three factors  namely group health insurance costs  fica expense  and retirement plan costs 
during  we k 
index experienced higher claims on our partially self insured group health insurance plan 
this resulted in a thousand increase in plan costs year over year 
in addition  during the expense associated with our pension plan increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand increase 
and finally  due to an increase in salaries expense  our fica tax increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand increase 
occupancy expense and furniture and fixture expense both increased during due to our expansion activities  increased utilities cost  and increased property taxes 
in we recorded total occupancy and furniture and fixture expenses of million 
this compares to million in  a thousand or increase 
during our utilities cost increased thousand due primarily to higher fuel prices 
our school and land taxes increased thousand or year over year due to increased property taxes assessed by the municipalities in which our main office and branch offices operate 
in addition  we acquired an office building in the hsbc branch acquisition 
and finally  building repair and maintenance costs due to increased snow removal costs and depreciation expense increased thousand and thousand  respectively  year over year 
computer service fees increased from thousand in to thousand in  a thousand or increase 
during the third quarter of  we converted our proprietary core computer operating system to a system more widely used throughout the banking industry 
to complete the conversion we incurred significant computer consulting fees to i convert existing data to the new system  ii build software interfaces between the core system and related ancillary computer systems  and iii set and test new system parameters 
in addition  to operate the new system s on an ongoing basis we entered into various software licensing agreements and maintenance contracts with several hardware and software computer system vendors 
advertising and marketing expense decreased thousand or in  from thousand in to thousand in during we recorded a significant increase in advertising and marketing expense to support our market expansion activities 
in addition  due to the low interest rate environment in  we increased the promotion expense related to variable rate home equity line of credit 
we reduced our expenditures on these marketing and advertising endeavors in due to our concentration on our computer conversion and compliance efforts 
professional fees increased thousand or in  from thousand in to thousand in the increase was principally due to a substantial increase in independent auditor fees and an accounting consultant related to our sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts

liquidity liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations in the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers  to fund loans to customers  and to fund our current and planned expenditures 
we are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position 
accordingly  we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis through our daily funds management process 
this includes maintaining the appropriate levels of currency throughout our branch system to meet the daily cash needs of our customers  balancing our mandated deposit or reserve requirements at the federal reserve bank of new york  maintaining adequate cash balances at our correspondent banks  and assuring that adequate levels of federal funds sold  liquid assets  and borrowing resources are available to meet obligations  including reasonably anticipated daily fluctuations 
in addition to the daily funds management process  we also monitor certain liquidity ratios and complete a liquidity assessment on a monthly basis 
the monthly evaluation report  known as the liquidity contingency scorecard  is reviewed by the alco and the bank s board of directors 
the report provides management with various ratios and financial market data that are compared to limits established within the bank s asset and liability management policy 
it was designed to provide an early warning signal for a potential liquidity crisis 
based on the limits established in the asset and liability management policy  we determined that the bank was in a a liquidity position at december   the strongest liquidity position based on management s internal rating system 
in addition  every days management prepares a sources and uses projection to estimate current and future sources and uses of liquidity 
the day sources and uses assessment is reviewed by our alco 
the alco  based on this assessment and other data  determines our future funding or investment needs and strategies 
the results of the day sources and uses assessment is reported to the board of directors of the bank quarterly 
we were in compliance with all of its internal liquidity policy limits at december  and december  the following list represents the sources of funds available to meet our liquidity requirements

in addition  our ability to meet unanticipated funding needs was strong 
at december  we maintained million of available for sale investment securities that could be pledged for borrowings or sold to meet unanticipated funding needs 
this compares to million at december  our fhlbny borrowing capacity increased between december  and december   due principally to continued repayment of borrowed funds throughout our fhlbny remaining borrowing capacity was million at december   as compared to million at december   a million increase 
in addition  at december  we maintained a million unsecured credit facility at a correspondent bank  in the event we needed to borrow federal funds on an overnight basis

we recognize that deposit flows and loan and investment prepayment activity are affected by the level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors  and other factors 
based on our deposit retention experience  anticipated levels of regional economic activity  particularly moderate levels of loan demand within our primary market area  and current pricing strategies  we anticipate that we will have sufficient levels of liquidity to meet our current funding commitments for several quarters prospectively

capital resources and dividends the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by our management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient capital base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
between december  and december  our total shareholders equity decreased million or 
total shareholders equity was million at december   as compared to million at december  the decrease in shareholders equity between the periods was due to several factors 
during the second quarter of  we completed a self tender for  shares of the company s common stock 
the shares were purchased at per share plus per share brokerage commission 
as a result of this transaction  we reduced total shareholders equity by million 
the self tender offer was completed to optimize the company s capital position  improve the return on equity and earnings per share for remaining shareholders and provide liquidity to shareholders wishing to divest some or all of their shares in the company s common stock 
during the year we also purchased  additional shares into treasury under our stock repurchase program 
as a result  our total treasury stock position increased from  at december  to  at december  and increased our total treasury stock at cost from million at december  to million at december   a million increase in treasury stock and decrease in total shareholders equity 
the decrease in total shareholders equity due to our stock repurchase activities was offset  in part  by an increase in retained earnings totaling million 
during  we earned million in net income and declared and paid million in cash dividends to shareholders 
and finally  during we increased accumulated other comprehensive loss thousand  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss was due to two factors 
first  during the fourth quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas no 
required us to recognized the over funded or under funded status of our frozen defined benefit postretirement benefit plan 
due the adoption of this accounting standard  we recorded an thousand decrease in total shareholders equity in second  the change in the net unrealized loss on securities  net of taxes increased thousand between december  and december  the company and the bank are both subject to regulatory capital guidelines 
under these guidelines  as established by federal bank regulators  to be adequately capitalized  the company and the bank must both maintain the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets at and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 
tier capital is comprised of shareholders equity  less intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income 
total capital  for this risk based capital standard  includes tier capital plus the company s allowance for loan losses 
similarly  for the bank to be considered well capitalized  it must maintain a tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio of and a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 
the company exceeded all capital adequacy guidelines and the bank exceeded all well capitalized guidelines at december   and december  the company s tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets ratio at december   were and  respectively 
this compares to and  respectively  at december  additional details regarding the company s and the bank s capital ratios are set forth in note of the company s consolidated financial statements located in part ii  item  of this document 
the principal source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the company has been dividends declared and paid to the company by its subsidiary bank 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to the company by its subsidiaries as well as the payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiary to the company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of the company and the bank to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines  and applicable laws

k 
index item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market conditions  including rates and prices  will reduce earnings and make the company less valuable 
we are primarily exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates 
this risk is called interest rate risk and is an inherent component of risk for all banks 
the risk occurs because we pay interest on deposits and borrowed funds at varying rates and terms  while receiving interest income on loans and investments with different rates and terms 
as a result  our earnings and the imputed economic value of assets and liabilities are subject to potentially significant fluctuations as interest rates rise and fall 
our objective is to minimize the fluctuation in net interest margin and net interest income caused by anticipated and unanticipated changes in interest rates 
ultimately  the bank s board of directors is responsible for monitoring and managing market and interest rate risk 
the board accomplishes this objective by annually reviewing and approving an asset and liability management policy  which establishes broad risk limits and delegates responsibility to carry out asset and liability oversight and control to the directors loan and investment committee and management s asset and liability committee alco 
we manage a few different forms of interest rate risk 
the first is mismatch risk  which involves the mismatch of maturities of fixed rate assets and liabilities 
the second is basis risk 
basis risk is the risk associated with non correlated changes in different interest rates 
for example  we price many of our adjustable rate commercial loans an asset using the prime rate as a basis  while some of our deposit accounts a liability are tied to treasury security yields 
in a given timeframe  the prime rate might decrease while a particular treasury security might only decrease 
if this were to occur  our yield on prime based commercial loans would decrease by  while the cost of deposits might only decrease by  negatively affecting net interest income and net interest margin 
the third risk is option risk 
option risk generally appears in the form of prepayment volatility on residential mortgages  commercial and commercial real estate loans  consumer loans  mortgage backed securities  and callable agency or municipal investment securities 
the bank s customers generally have alternative financing sources or options to refinance their existing debt obligations with other financial institutions 
when interest rates decrease  many of these customers exercise this option and refinance at other institutions and prepay their loans with us  forcing us to reinvest the prepaid funds in lower yielding investments and loans 
the same type of refinancing activity also accelerates principal payments on mortgage backed securities held by the bank 
municipal investment securities and agency securities are issued with specified call dates and call prices and are typically exercised by the issuer when interest rates on comparable maturity securities are lower than the current coupon rate on the security 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that the bank s management must continually perform to meet the objective of maintaining stable net interest income and net interest margin 
this means that prior to setting the term or interest rate on loans or deposits  or before purchasing investment securities or borrowing funds  management must understand the impact that alternative interest rates will have on the bank s interest rate risk profile 
this is accomplished through simulation modeling 
simulation modeling is the process of shocking the current balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios and then measuring the impact of interest rate changes on both projected earnings and the economic value of the bank s equity 
the estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based on numerous assumptions including  but not limited to the nature and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit retention rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement rates on asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based on available information and current economic and local market conditions  management cannot make any assurances as to the ultimate accuracy of these assumptions  including competitive influences and customer behavior 
accordingly  actual results will differ from those predicted by simulation modeling 
the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income from a parallel shift in all market interest rates 
the shift in interest rates is assumed to occur in monthly increments of per month until the full shift is complete 
in other words  we assume it will take months for a shift to take place 
this is also known as a ramped interest rate shock 
the projected changes in net interest income are totals for the month period beginning january  and ending december   under ramped shock scenarios 
k 
index interest rate sensitivity table interest rates dollars in thousands interest rate shock prime rate projected annualized net interest income projected dollar change in net interest income projected percentage change in net interest income projected change in net interest income as a percent of total shareholders equity no change under a ramped interest rate shock  interest rates are modeled to change at a rate of per month 
many assumptions are embedded within our interest rate risk model 
these assumptions are approved by the bank s alco and are based upon both management s experience and projections provided by investment securities companies 
assuming our prepayment and other assumptions are accurate and assuming we take reasonable actions to preserve net interest income  we project that net interest income would decline by thousand or of total shareholders equity in a ramped interest rate shock and thousand or of total shareholders equity in a ramped interest rate shock 
this is within our asset and liability policy guideline  which limits the maximum projected decrease in net interest income in a or ramped interest rate shock to of the company s total equity capital 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk is impacted by general market conditions and customer demand 
but generally  we try to limit the volume and term of fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities so that we can adjust the mix and pricing of assets and liabilities to mitigate net interest income volatility 
we also purchase investments for the securities portfolio and structure borrowings from the fhlbny to offset interest rate risk taken in the loan portfolio 
we also offer adjustable rate loan and deposit products that change as interest rates change 
approximately of our total assets at december  were invested in adjustable rate loans and investments 
at december   the treasury yield curve was inverted 
this means short term treasury yields exceeded long term treasury yields 
the six month treasury bill yield was at the end of december  versus for the ten year treasury note 
this inverted interest rate environment inhibits our ability to earn net interest income  since banks typically earn net interest income by procuring short term deposits and borrowings and investing those proceeds in longer term loans and investments 
this practice  which is sometimes referred to as mismatching assets and liabilities  typically allows banks to enhance their interest spread  which generates net interest income 
if this inverted interest rate environment persists  it may negatively impact our ability to increase net interest income for several quarters prospectively 
in we earned million of net interest income 
this compares to million in  a thousand or decrease 
based on the interest rate sensitivity table above  we conservatively project that we will earn net interest income between million and million in  if the inverted yield curve persists and the general level of interest rates remain relatively unchanged or increase or decrease by basis points in a ramped manner during the year
