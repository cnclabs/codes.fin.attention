executive summary and financial highlights we are a global power leader that designs  manufactures  distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines  electric power generation systems and engine related products  including filtration and emissions solutions  fuel systems  controls and air handling systems 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and other customers worldwide 
we have long standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve  including daimlerchryslerag daimlerchrysler  paccar inc  international truck and engine corporation navistar international corporation  volvo ab  cnh global nv  tata motors ltd  ford  volkswagen  dongfeng motor company  komatsu and scania ab 
we serve our customers through a network of more than company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately  dealer locations in more than countries and territories 
our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine  power generation  components  and distribution 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves 
this type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets 
the engines are used in trucks of all sizes  buses and rvs  as well as various industrial applications including construction  mining  agriculture  marine  oil and gas  rail  and military 
the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems selling engines  generator sets and alternators and providing rental of power equipment for both standby and prime power uses 
the components segment includes sales of filtration products  exhaust and aftertreatment systems  turbochargers and fuel systems 
the distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines  generator sets  and service parts  performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 
our financial performance depends  in large part  on varying conditions in the markets we serve  particularly the on highway  construction and general industrial markets 
demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels 
oem inventory levels  production schedules and work stoppages also impact our sales 
economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reduced sales  which affect our profits and cash flow 
we are also subject to substantial government regulation which requires us to make significant investments in capital and research that also impacts our profits and cash flow 
we continued our strong performances of the past two years into with a third straight year of record net sales and net earnings 
net earnings were million  or per diluted share  on sales of billion  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  on sales of billion 
the earnings improvement was driven by a percent increase in net sales and a percent increase in gross margin  as we continue to benefit from improved economic conditions resulting in high levels of demand across our businesses  as well as increased share in a number of markets and our focus on cost reduction 
all of our segments reported sales increases for the year compared to a year ago  with particularly strong demand in the heavy duty truck market and the power generation commercial market  where sales increased percent and percent  respectively 
overall  our engine segment net sales were up million  or percent 
in addition  net sales increased at our power generation segment up million  or percent  components segment up million  or percent and distribution segment up million  or percent year over year 
years ended december  millions  except earnings per share consolidated results net sales gross margin investee equity  royalty and other income operating earnings net earnings diluted earnings per share during  we continued our commitment to building a strong balance sheet  investing in profitable growth around the globe and returning value to our shareholders 
some of the transactions and events that highlight this are as follows business expansion in january  we signed a joint venture agreement with kamaz inc  the largest vehicle manufacturer in russia  to produce b series engines under the name zao cummins kama 
the joint venture will build on the cummins and kamaz relationship that dates back to the early s 
among the customers of the new company are kamaz for trucks and buses  as well as other manufacturers in russia  belarus and the ukraine that produce trucks  buses and agricultural equipment 
after announcing a feasibility study in the spring  we signed an agreement in october with beiqi foton motor company beiqi foton to form a joint venture  beijing foton cummins engine company bfcec  to produce two families of cummins light duty  high performance diesel engines in beijing 
the engines will be used in light duty commercial trucks  pickup trucks  multipurpose and sport utility vehicles 
certain types of marine  small construction equipment and industrial applications will also be served by this engine family 
cummins and beiqi foton will initially invest a combined million into bfcec  which is scheduled to begin production in the parties are awaiting approval of the joint venture by the chinese government 
in july  we announced that we had reached agreement with a major automotive manufacturer serving the north american market to produce and market a light duty  diesel powered engine 
in october  we announced that we would use an existing facility for production of this new engine platform and that daimlerchrysler was our significant customer 
as a part of the agreement  we will develop and manufacture a family of high performance  light duty diesel engines for a variety of on highway applications in vehicles below  pounds gross vehicle weight  including standard pickup trucks  like the dodge ram  and sport utility vehicles  as well as industrial applications 
the first vehicles with this engine are expected to be ready for market by the end of the decade 
in august  our first technical center in china was opened in wuhan city 
the east asia technical center  a consolidated joint venture between cummins and dongfeng cummins engine company limited dcec  will provide engineering and technical development services for the full range of cummins products built in china  including diesel and natural gas engines  power generators  turbochargers and filtration products 
a series of projects has already started in the technical center  including the development of a new liter engine platform for the heavy duty truck market served by dcec 
business divestiture on september   we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell our seg gmbh subsidiary seg based in kempen  germany to woodward governor company 
the sale closed in the fourth quarter for approximately million and resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
seg  which is a part of our power generation segment  specializes in the design and manufacturing of measurement  control and protection products for power generation systems with an emphasis on the wind power generation segment 
total assets of seg were approximately million at the date of the transaction and million at december   which is less than percent of our total assets at those dates 
total sales of seg were approximately million and million  for the ten months ended october  and for the year ended december   respectively  which is less than percent of our total net sales for these periods 
financing matters on may   the board of directors approved our plan to redeem all of the convertible quarterly income preferred securities that were issued in june on may   we gave the trustee our formal irrevocable notification of our intent to redeem the preferred securities 
as a result  substantially all of the related million of convertible subordinated debentures outstanding were converted into shares of our common stock 
during the second quarter of  we completed our previously announced million share repurchase program 
in july  the board of directors authorized us to acquire up to two million shares of cummins common stock in addition to what has been acquired under previous authorizations 
during the third and fourth quarters  we purchased  shares for approximately million 
in addition  the board also voted in july to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by percent to per share 
our level of debt at december   has decreased by million since december  and our debt to capital ratio has improved to percent at december   from percent at december  as previously announced  we repaid our million notes in december  the first call date for the debt 
the notes were issued in and were repaid using cash generated from operations 
we incurred additional costs of approximately million associated with the early extinguishment of this debt  which is recorded in other income expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings 
during we made contributions of approximately million to our pension plans 
as of the end of  our global pension funding was approximately percent of our obligation

engine sales were up million  or percent  due to strong demand from heavy and medium duty truck oems  higher engine volumes for industrial applications and increased shipments of light duty engines 
engine and part sales to on highway markets were percent higher compared to last year with increased volumes in most market segments 
power generation sales increased million  or percent  due to increased demand across all product lines 
components sales increased million  or percent  due to increased sales within all of our components businesses 
distribution sales increased million  or percent  primarily due to increased demand for power generation products followed by increased parts  service and engine volumes 
see our operating segment results section for further details on sales by segment 
gross margin gross margin improved primarily due to increased sales  the related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs  and changes in sales mix  all of which increased gross margin by million 
in addition  million in price realization  net of increased product costs  improved gross margin in the current year compared to the prior year 
these increases in margin were partially offset by increased warranty expenses of million  primarily as a result of the increased volumes as well as increased spending of million for new product introductions and ramp up 
warranty expense as a percent of sales increased slightly to percent in compared to percent in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental staffing and higher compensation and related expenses of approximately million  which included salaries  variable compensation and fringe benefits  as a result of our improved financial performance 
other factors affecting selling and administrative expenses included increased consulting fees and other outside services of million  increased marketing and administrative expenses of million and increased travel expenses of million 
the remaining change in selling and administrative expenses is due to a combination of increases in various other miscellaneous expenses  none of which were significant individually  partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact 
overall selling and administrative expenses were percent of sales in compared to percent of sales in research and engineering expenses research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to increased compensation expense and consulting and outside services  as well as higher spending on development programs for future products 
we had significant research and engineering expenses across the engine and components segments related to new product development for and beyond as well as research and engineering expenses for growth platforms across geographies 
the engine segment accounted for million of the increase in research and engineering expenses along with an increase in the components segment of million 
fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate 
investee equity  royalty and other income investee equity  royalty and other income increased slightly primarily due to an increase in earnings at several of our equity investees  led by an million increase in earnings from our north american distributors  a million increase in earnings from tata cummins ltd 
and a million increase in earnings from ccec 
these increases were partially offset  by a million decrease in earnings from dongfeng cummins engine company  ltd 
dcec  as a result of weakness in the medium duty truck market  due to the continuous tonnage upgrade of china s truck industry 
other operating expenses  net the major components of other operating expense are royalty income  amortization of intangible assets and gain or loss on sale of fixed assets 
the results include a million gain on the sale of seg and a legal settlement of approximately million 
in addition  royalty income decreased by approximately million in fluctuations in other miscellaneous operating expenses and income  none of which were material  resulted in an additional million of other operating expense 
interest income interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in compared to the higher average cash balances are due to increased earnings and stronger cash flows from operations in interest expense interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt balances in as compared to the conversion of our million convertible subordinated debentures during the second quarter resulted in a reduction in interest expense of over million for other income expenses  net the major components of other income expense include foreign currency exchange gains and losses  bank charges and other miscellaneous income and expenses 
the fluctuation in other income in compared to is due to a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange gains and losses from a loss of approximately million in to a gain of approximately million in partially offsetting the fluctuation in foreign currency gains and losses was a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt incurred when we repaid our million notes in december in addition  there were several fluctuations in the components of miscellaneous other income and expenses  none of which were individually significant 
provision for income taxes our tax rates are generally less than the percent us income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings  export tax benefits and research tax credits 
our effective tax rate for was percent 
our income tax provision for was impacted by a million  or per share  increase in the first quarter for the effect of new indiana tax legislation  and a million  or per share  reduction in the second quarter due to the favorable resolution of tax uncertainties related to prior years and by a million  or per share  reduction in the fourth quarter due to the retroactive reinstatement of the us research tax credit 
our effective tax rate for was percent 
our provision was reduced by million for the tax benefits of foreign dividend distributions which qualified for a special percent deduction under the american jobs creation act of and by million due to the favorable resolution in the fourth quarter of of prior year tax positions which had been in dispute 
we expect our effective tax rate to be percent excluding any discrete items that may arise 
the jobs act phases out the export tax benefits reduced percent for  percent for and repealed thereafter that have been a key factor in our low tax rate 
export benefits are replaced with a new us manufacturer s tax deduction which began phasing in starting in however  we do not expect the manufacturer s deduction to produce a comparable level of benefits 
minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries minority interest is primarily attributable to cummins india ltd 
cil  a percent owned subsidiary  cummins eastern canada llp cec  a percent owned subsidiary  and wuxi holset engineering co 
ltd 
wuxi  a percent owned subsidiary 
these three subsidiaries account for over percent of the total minority interest in earnings at these three subsidiaries increased this year resulting in a combined increase in minority interest of million for compared to in addition  earnings at seg gmbh co

engine and part sales to on highway markets were percent higher compared to with increased volumes in all market segments 
power generation sales increased million  or percent  due to increased demand for commercial generator sets  generator drives  and alternators  partially offset by a moderate decrease in rental revenue and a slight decrease in sales to the consumer market 
components sales increased million  or percent  primarily reflecting increased demand from first fit oems and the aftermarket channel 
distribution sales increased million  or percent  primarily due to increased demand for engines and power generation products internationally and sales growth from distributor acquisitions 
see our operating segment results and outlook section for further details on sales by segment 
gross margin gross margin improved primarily due to increased sales  the related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs  and changes in sales mix  all of which increased gross margin by million 
in addition  pricing actions of million in enabled us to more than offset the increased material costs of steel and other commodities of million 
other factors which impacted gross margin to a lesser extent were slightly increased warranty costs  the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and other miscellaneous cost reductions 
as a result of the foregoing  gross margin percentage increased to percent in from percent in warranty expense as a percent of sales decreased slightly to percent in compared to percent in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation and related expenses of approximately million  which included salaries  variable compensation and fringe benefits  as a result of our improved financial performance 
in addition  incremental staffing added to the increased compensation and related expenses 
shipping and handling costs increased by approximately million due to increased sales volumes 
other factors increasing selling and administrative expenses to a lesser extent included marketing and administrative expenses  consulting fees and other outside services  which combined for million of the increase 
overall selling and administrative expenses were percent of sales in compared to percent of sales in research and engineering expenses research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to increased compensation expense and consulting and outside services  as well as higher spending on prototype development programs for future products 
the engine segment accounted for million of the increase in research and engineering expenses along with a slight increase in the components segment  offset by a slight decrease in the power generation segment 
other miscellaneous research and development expenses increased as well  however they were not significant individually or in the aggregate 
investee equity  royalty and other income investee equity  royalty and other income increased primarily due to improved earnings from our north american distributors of million and improved earnings from ccec of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreased earnings from dcec of million due to reduced demand in china s truck market in response to regulatory changes 
other operating expenses  net the major components of other operating expenses are royalty income  amortization of intangible assets and loss on sale of fixed assets 
the fluctuation from to was primarily due to a decrease in the loss on sale of fixed assets 
interest income interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in compared to the increased cash balances are due to increased earnings and stronger cash flows from operations in interest expense interest expense decreased slightly due to a combination of factors 
interest expense on debt in was lower due to the repayment of long term debt in the first quarter 
the lower interest expense on debt was partially offset by increased interest expense on capital leases related to power generation equipment due to the conversion of operating leases to capital leases in late other expenses  net the major components of other expense include foreign currency exchange gains and losses  bank charges and other miscellaneous expenses 
the increase in other expense in compared to is primarily due to an increase in foreign currency exchange losses and a decrease in the gain on sale of marketable securities 
these increases to other expense were partially offset by write downs of investments in that did not recur in provision for income taxes the higher tax provision of percent reflects the increase in earnings before taxes 
our provision was reduced by million for the tax benefits of foreign dividend distributions which qualified for a special percent deduction under the american jobs creation act of and by million due to the favorable resolution in the fourth quarter of of prior year tax positions which had been in dispute 
excluding these unusual or nonrecurring benefits  our effective tax rate was percent 
this rate was lower than the percent us tax rate  primarily because of us export tax benefits and research tax credits along with lower taxes on foreign earnings  especially foreign joint venture equity earnings recorded net of foreign taxes 
minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries the increase in minority interests was primarily attributable to higher earnings at cummins eastern canada llp  a percent owned subsidiary and cummins india limited  a percent owned subsidiary 
these two subsidiaries account for over seventy percent of the total minority interest in the remainder of the increase in minority interests was attributable to a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in earnings at the remaining consolidated subsidiaries 
operating segment results and outlook our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine  power generation  components  and distribution 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves 
this type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets 
the engines are used in trucks of all sizes  buses and rvs  as well as various industrial applications including construction  mining  agriculture  marine  oil and gas  rail and military 
the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems selling engines  generator sets and alternators and providing rental of power equipment for both standby and prime power uses 
the components segment includes sales of filtration products  exhaust and aftertreatment systems  turbochargers and fuel systems 
the distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines  generator sets  and service parts  performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems 
we use segment ebit defined as earnings before interest expense  taxes and minority interests as a primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments 
segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments 
the accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 
we prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions 
we have allocated certain common costs and expenses  primarily corporate functions  among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
these include certain costs and expenses of shared services  such as information technology  human resources  legal and finance 
we also do not allocate debt related items  actuarial gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  minimum pension liabilities or income taxes to individual segments 
segment ebit may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
a summary of operating results by segment for the years ended december  is shown below engine power generation components distribution non segment items total millions net sales investee equity  royalty and other income segment ebit net sales investee equity  royalty and other income segment ebit net sales investee equity  royalty and other income segment ebit includes intercompany eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses 
the tables below reconcile the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the consolidated financial statements years ended december  millions segment ebit less interest expense earnings before income taxes and minority interests we made certain leadership changes effective may   within our management team 
in connection with these changes  certain modifications were made to our internal reporting 
these modifications are summarized below the filtration and other segment was renamed the components segment and now includes operating results of the fuel systems business which were previously included in the engine segment 
historically  the fuel systems business transferred product within the engine segment at cost 
beginning in the third quarter of  those transfers now use a cost plus based transfer price 
as a result of this change  segment ebit increased for the components segment and decreased for the engine segment but there was no impact to consolidated earnings 
revenues of the components segment were also increased to reflect transfers to the engine segment and eliminations were increased by a corresponding amount 
the north american distribution business was combined with the international distribution segment and renamed the distribution segment 
previously  the north american distribution business was reported in the engine and power generation segments as equity from investees and included the results of a partially owned distributor that is consolidated 
as a result  revenues of the engine segment were increased to reflect sales to the consolidated distributor that were previously eliminated and decreased for the revenues of the consolidated distributor which are now included in the distribution segment 
in addition  this change also caused earnings from equity investees in the engine and power generation segments to decrease while earnings from equity investees in the distribution segment increased by a corresponding amount 
due to the extent of intersegment sales activity and certain seasonality in inventory levels during the year  we have presented the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory resulting from intersegment transactions in the non segment items column of our segment reporting see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this presentation better aligns segment revenues with segment costs and presents segment ebit as if each segment was an independent  stand alone entity 
the impact of the above changes on operating results and net assets by segment for is shown in the table below engine power generation components distribution non segment items millions increase decrease net sales investee equity  royalty and other income segment ebit net assets includes intercompany eliminations and unallocated expenses

the net sales  investee income and segment ebit for engine were as follows dollars in millions years ended december  change amount percent net sales investee equity  royalty and other income segment ebit segment ebit as a percentage of net sales percentage points the increase in net sales for this segment was primarily due to strong demand across most markets  particularly the north american heavy duty truck market and stationary power due to the strong performance of our power generation segment  along with strong industrial market sales 
total on highway related sales were percent of engine segment net sales during and the improvement in segment ebit was primarily due to the higher engine volumes across all major markets  the accompanying gross margin benefits of higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs  improved pricing and manufacturing efficiencies  all of which resulted in a nearly one percentage point improvement in gross margin percentage in compared to last year 
gross margin increased million  or percent  in compared to last year 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly 
research and engineering expenses increased million  or percent  compared to and remained flat as a percentage of net sales compared to last year 
in addition  earnings from joint ventures decreased million compared with  primarily due to a million decrease in earnings at dcec as a result of weakness in the medium duty truck market  due to the continuous tonnage upgrade of china s truck industry

global unit shipments of heavy duty truck engines were up percent in compared to  with north american shipments up percent and international shipments up percent 
medium duty truck and bus the increase in medium duty truck and bus revenues was due to strong demand ahead of the change in emission standards and our growing market share position with north american oems in the medium duty truck and bus markets 
shipments of medium duty truck engines were up percent to north american oems and down percent to international oems compared with shipments to north american bus oems increased percent in compared to while international shipments were down percent 
the increase in medium duty truck and bus engine shipments in north america is due to our increased penetration in this market and an overall increase in demand ahead of the emission standard changes 
the decrease in shipments to international medium duty truck oems is primarily due to changes in emissions standards in brazil to euro iii effective january  the decrease in international bus engine shipments year over year is due to a large purchase made in by a customer in china 
light duty automotive and rv sales of light duty automotive engines increased as a result of higher volumes 
total light duty automotive unit shipments were approximately  in  an increase of percent compared to the majority of the light duty automotive and rv volumes was driven by demand from daimlerchrysler with shipments of approximately  units  or a percent increase compared to engine shipments to recreational vehicle oems increased by nearly percent in compared with due to new product introductions and growing penetration at key oems 
industrial total sales were up in most industrial markets  primarily due to strong demand 
unit shipments increased percent in compared to approximately percent of the shipments were to north american markets and percent to international markets in compared to percent and percent  respectively  in the overall change in the geographic sales mix is due to the continued strength of the international construction market which is being driven by strong demand in the middle east and asia 
total shipments to the construction market increased percent largely because international shipments increased percent 
other markets showing significant increases in shipments were the mining market and the oil and gas market with increases of percent and percent  respectively 
the mining market demand is up as the strength in commodity prices has been driving investment in mining capacity 
the shipments to the oil and gas market have increased as sustained oil and natural gas prices continue to drive activity and investments in new equipment 
in addition  we continue to penetrate this market further with the release of more engine platforms to this application 
other industrial markets had modest increases in shipments compared to stationary power the increase in sales to stationary power markets is due to the increased net sales to our power generation segment 
these net sales are eliminated in our consolidated statements of earnings

total on highway related engine sales were percent of engine segment net sales in  compared with percent in the improvement in segment ebit was primarily due to the higher engine volumes across all major markets  the accompanying gross margin benefits of higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs  pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts  all of which resulted in a two percentage point improvement in gross margin percentage over gross margin increased million  or percent  over selling and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  over  however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved almost a full percentage point 
research and engineering expenses increased million  or percent  compared to and remained flat as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior period 
in addition  earnings from joint ventures remained flat compared with  due to higher earnings from several joint ventures  which were offset by a million decrease in earnings at dcec in reaction to changes in the regulatory environment

unit shipments of heavy duty truck engines were up percent in  compared to  with north american shipments up percent and international shipments up percent 
medium duty truck and bus the increase in medium duty truck and bus revenues is due to increased shipments of medium duty truck and bus engines in north america and internationally 
shipments of medium duty truck engines were up percent to north american oems and up percent to international oems compared with the increase in medium duty truck engine shipments was driven primarily by economic growth as demand in this market typically correlates with demand in the heavy duty market 
sales of bus engines and parts increased in compared to due to strong demand from north american oems with shipments up percent and international shipments up percent 
international shipments were up due to strong demand in asia and latin america  slightly offset by lower volumes in europe 
light duty automotive sales of light duty automotive engines increased as a result of higher volumes 
total unit shipments were  in  an increase of percent compared to most of the increase in light duty automotive sales was driven by continued demand from daimlerchrysler with record shipments of  units  or a percent increase compared to engine shipments to rv oems remained flat in compared with industrial total sales were up in most industrial markets  primarily due to strong demand as the capital goods sector of the economy expanded 
unit shipments increased percent year over year reflecting a slight change in sales mix to higher priced engines 
approximately percent of the shipments were to north american markets and percent to international markets compared to percent and percent  respectively  in both the construction and agricultural markets had increased sales of approximately percent in over  while sales for the mining and marine markets increased percent and percent  respectively  during the same time period 
these markets make up over percent of the total industrial market 
the increased sales in these markets were seen both in north american and international markets with the exception of a slight decrease in sales to the international agriculture market 
stationary power the increase in sales to stationary power markets is due to the increased net sales to our power generation segment 
these net sales are eliminated in our consolidated statements of earnings 
see the power generation results and outlook for a discussion of the increase in net sales 
outlook for net sales for this segment are expected to be flat in with increased shipments in the off highway and medium duty truck and bus markets offsetting the decrease in the north american heavy duty truck market 
while north american heavy duty class truck sales will likely be down to percent in  our year over year north american heavy duty truck engine volumes could be down as much as percent depending on the amount of engine inventory currently at the truck oems 
the decline will be most severe in the first half of  with industry shipments expected to improve in the second half of as a result  we expect our market share to drop in the first quarter  due to oem s carrying over more competitor engines to manage their vehicle model transition  and quickly recover in the second half of the year to levels or higher as we believe our new products will quickly gain widespread acceptance versus competitive engine technologies 
we expect the brazilian medium duty truck market to remain flat in  while our european medium duty truck engine shipments will benefit from our new supply relationship with nissan 
these markets  together with significant market share gains in north america  are forecasted to drive global medium duty truck and bus shipments up approximately percent in we expect shipments to the global light duty automotive and rv markets to increase nearly percent in through new product offerings and increased availability of our product at key oems 
although some commodity prices have retreated at the end of from their historical highs  we expect to see sustained demand in for our engines in the oil and gas and mining equipment markets 
growth in these markets will be paced by our incremental percent capacity expansion planned in our high horsepower plants during the year 
global construction shipments are expected to show modest growth in with increased availability at oems in north america  india and japan 
we expect earnings for this segment to be the lowest in the first quarter in with expected improvements throughout the year as we increase operational efficiencies related to new product introduction 
new product pricing is expected to be largely offset by new product cost 
we anticipate full year ebit margins will be slightly below or equal to the bottom end of the targeted range of to percent of sales

our commercial and alternator businesses are up in nearly all markets 
our consumer  power electronics  energy solutions and rental markets also saw modest increases 
partially offsetting the increased sales in these lines of business was the absence of sales from seg as the business was sold in the fourth quarter 
the improvement in segment ebit was largely attributable to strong commercial generator set and alternator sales across geographic markets  except china  as well as improved mix and price realization 
while material costs  particularly copper  have increased year over year  we have been able to more than absorb these costs through improved pricing 
gross margin improved million  or percent  in compared to gross margin percentage improved nearly one percentage point compared to selling and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  over  however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved by one half of a percentage point in  compared to research and engineering expenses increased million  or percent during  compared to and as a percentage of net sales increased slightly compared to a summary of engine shipments used in power generation equipment by engine category follows years ended december  change amount percent midrange heavy duty high horsepower total unit shipments vs

pricing actions also contributed to the increase in net sales 
the improvement in segment ebit was largely attributable to strong commercial generator set sales across all geographic markets  except china  and the related benefits of fixed cost absorption as well as price realization and cost reduction actions 
these benefits were partially offset by increased costs of materials  primarily copper

a summary of engine shipments used in power generation equipment by engine category follows years ended december  change amount percent midrange heavy duty high horsepower total unit shipments outlook for we expect net sales to grow to percent in  excluding the absence of net sales due to the disposal of seg in we expect net sales of commercial generator sets and alternator equipment to continue to be robust in north america  the uk  the middle east  eastern and western europe and india 
consumer sales are projected to increase as we ramp up production of portable gensets  introduce auxiliary power units for commercial trucks and expect greater penetration in the towable segment of the rv market 
price realization on new products  global sourcing initiatives and manufacturing efficiency gains are anticipated to produce steady improvement in margins throughout earnings for this segment are expected to remain near or at the top end of its targeted range of to percent of sales

sales of our turbochargers increased due to higher aftermarket sales to oems  partially offset by lower demand in china 
segment ebit improved slightly  compared with  primarily due to improved volume  however ebit as a percentage of net sales declined slightly due to a lower gross margin percentage resulting from higher steel prices used in exhaust products and manufacturing filters as well as production inefficiencies driven by capacity constraints 
gross margin increased million  or percent  over  however gross margin percentage decreased slightly 
in addition  higher selling and administrative expenses and increases in research and engineering expenses contributed to the reduction in segment ebit as a percentage of net sales

research and engineering expenses increased due to the development of a number of new products that were launched in and beyond 
research and engineering expenses increased million  or percent  compared to and remained flat year over year as a percentage of net sales 
outlook for net sales for this segment are forecasted to grow approximately to percent in  primarily due to growth in our emission solutions and turbocharger businesses 
the manufacturing improvements that we began to implement in the second half of are expected to correct operational issues in the emission solutions business in the material cost and operational issues in the turbocharger business are expected to yield a slower margin improvement as they ramp up new products 
we expect to see sequential improvement in earnings from this segment after the first quarter and to achieve the lower end of the targeted range of to percent of net sales by the end of distribution results and outlook vs 
the net sales  investee income and segment ebit for distribution were as follows dollars in millions years ended december  change amount percent net sales investee equity  royalty and other income segment ebit segment ebit as a percentage of net sales percentage points distribution net sales increased primarily due to strong overall demand in the middle east  europe and the south pacific 
the higher net sales were led by increases in power generation volume followed by parts  service and engine volume 
the middle east is the primary driver for the higher power generation volume accounting for over half of the increase 
parts and service and engine volumes were up throughout several geographic markets  most notably europe  east asia  and the middle east 
segment ebit increased primarily due to higher gross margins resulting from greater sales of engines  parts  and power generation equipment 
gross margin in improved million  or percent  over  however gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to an unfavorable shift in mix from parts to engines and gensets 
the increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  however selling and administrative expenses decreased by over one half of a percentage point as a percentage of net sales in the same period 
also contributing to the increase in segment ebit year over year was a million increase in investee equity earnings primarily attributable to an million increase in earnings at our north american distributors

in addition  net sales were favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates 
segment ebit increased primarily due to higher gross margins resulting from increased sales of engines  parts and service  and power generation equipment  as well as pricing actions and favorable exchange rates 
gross margin improved million  or percent  over  while gross margin percentage increased almost two percentage points 
the increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses  primarily from acquisitions  new branch openings and dealer development support 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  and increased just over one percentage point as a percentage of net sales in the same period 
also contributing to the increase in segment ebit year over year was a million increase in investee equity earnings 
this is primarily attributable to an million increase in earnings at our north american distributors 
outlook for we will no longer consolidate one of our north american joint ventures  beginning in see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding this joint venture 
in addition  an independent distributor in iraq will market the sales of power generation equipment in that country rather than through our company owned distributor in dubai 
excluding these changes to the reporting of segment revenue  we expect net sales to increase between and percent in while we are adding two distributors in europe early in  the majority of this growth will be organic from existing distributors 
non residential construction spending outside of the us is expected to continue to drive our revenue growth in power generation and the off highway engine markets 
we also announced the formation of joint ventures in thailand and nigeria and expect to finalize new joint ventures in colombia  south america and the carolinas here in the us early in earnings for this segment are forecasted to remain above the top end of its targeted range of to percent of sales

at certain times  cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations  and as a result  we may use periodic borrowings  primarily our revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable sales program  to fund our working capital requirements 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our receivable sales program 
cash and cash equivalents increased million during to million at the end of the year compared to million at the beginning of the year 
cash and cash equivalents were higher in as a result of an increase in cash provided by operations generated primarily by higher net earnings 
we have focused much of our efforts on improving our balance sheet through debt reduction and increasing our liquidity 
we believe our net debt position is a strong indicator of how much progress we have made in these areas 
this measure is not defined under us gaap and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
our net debt position is as follows millions total debt less cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities net debt at december   we believe our liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million  million available under our revolving credit facility  million available under our accounts receivable program and million available under international credit facilities see the table below under available credit capacity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to satisfy future short term funding requirements for working capital  debt service obligations  capital expenditures  projected pension funding  common stock repurchases  dividend payments and expansion in emerging markets 
the jobs act provided for a temporary percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
the deduction resulted in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
we repatriated million under the jobs act in foreign earnings repatriated under the jobs act increased liquidity in the united states  with a corresponding reduction of liquidity in our foreign subsidiaries 
our total debt was million as of december   compared with  million at december  total debt as a percent of our total capital  including total long term debt  was percent at december   compared to percent at december  included in long term debt at december  and  was million and million  respectively  attributable to consolidating a leasing entity under the provisions of fin r see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
also included in short term and long term debt at december   was million from the consolidation of two joint ventures consolidated under the provisions of fin r see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of these entities did not materially impact our or net earnings nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants 
we do not expect the consolidation of these entities to have a material impact on net earnings or affect our compliance with debt covenants in future periods

net cash provided by operating activities improved million in compared to  primarily due to million of higher net earnings and an million decrease in cash utilized for working capital  partially offset by an increase in pension funding of million and a decrease in cash provided by changes in long term liabilities of million 
net changes in working capital utilized million in cash during compared to utilizing million in  or a net decrease in cash utilized for working capital of million year over year 
cash utilized for working capital tends to fluctuate from period to period based on various factors including  sales and production volumes as well as timing 
pension funding increased year over year  as we made additional contributions towards our goal of reaching percent funded by the end of as of the end of  our global pension funding was at approximately percent of global pension benefit obligations 
the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets  market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans 
declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the projected and accumulated obligation  however  better than expected investment returns and additional voluntary contributions have improved the funded status of all plans  helping to minimize future required funding 
during we made cash contributions of million 
we expect to contribute approximately million to million to our defined benefit pension plans in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of million  which includes an increase in investments in internal use software of million 
net cash utilized for purchases of marketable securities in was million as we increased our short term investment holdings as opposed to when we were in a net liquidation of securities position with net cash proceeds of million 
significant sources of cash from investing activities year over year includes increased proceeds from the disposal of equipment of million as well as million received related to the sale of seg 
the majority of our capital spending in was primarily for new product introduction  capacity expansion  manufacturing equipment  and tooling for new products 
capital expenditures for will increase to support our growth  and will include investments to increase capacity and to fund our new products 
our investments in capacity improvement are focused  cut across all of our businesses and designed for rapid return on investment 
we continue to invest more of our capital in low cost regions of the world to further leverage our opportunities for cost reduction 
we currently expect capital expenditures for to be between million and million to support these initiatives 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to a use of cash of million in  or a net change in cash outflows of million year over year 
in  we repaid our million notes while in we repaid our million notes 
the other significant use of cash in financing activities when comparing to relates to repurchases of our common stock 
in we completed our previously announced million stock repurchase and we began repurchasing stock under a new repurchase plan that began in the third quarter of year over year our stock repurchases increased million 
also contributing to the increase  to a lesser extent  was a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and an increase in dividend payments due to the percent increase in quarterly dividends that the board approved in july 
versus operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities improved million in compared to  primarily due to million of higher net earnings  a million increase in the deferred tax provision  a million increase in long term liabilities and a million change in equity earnings of investees  partially offset by an increase in working capital of million 
net changes in working capital utilized million in cash during compared to providing million in  or a net decrease in cash provided by working capital of million year over year 
the net increase of million of cash used by changes in working capital compared to resulted primarily from lower accrued expenses of million  higher accounts receivable of million and lower accounts payable of million  partially offset by lower inventory of million and changes in other current assets of million 
accounts receivable increased due to higher sales levels  a higher mix of international receivables  and the discontinuance of a major customer s trade payables program that previously allowed for accelerated payment terms 
the net reduction in accounts payable was due to a larger ramp up in production during and the decrease in accrued expenses was driven by a lower increase in accrued warranty of million and a lower increase in accrued payrolls of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of million  which included investments in internal use software of million and a decrease in cash inflows from net liquidations of marketable securities of million  partially offset by a million decrease in cash used for acquisition of businesses  investments in and advances to equity investees of million  and an increase in proceeds from disposals of million 
the majority of our capital spending of million in was primarily for capacity increases  manufacturing equipment and tooling for new products 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to a million source of cash in  or a net change in cash outflows of million year over year 
the majority of the change year over year is due to the march   repayment of the million notes  a significant decrease in the proceeds of common stock issued from the exercise of stock options of million and million in common stock repurchases in cash dividends cash dividends of per common share were declared in the first and second quarter of in july  the board of directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by percent  and as a result cash dividends of per common share were declared in the third and fourth quarter of cash dividends of per common share were declared and paid in each quarter of and dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our earnings and liquidity position  among other factors 
share repurchases in july  the board of directors authorized us to acquire up to two million shares of cummins common stock in addition to what has been acquired under previous authorizations 
for the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million of common stock  representing approximately million shares 
this included purchases under our million share repurchase program introduced in september  which was completed in the second quarter of debt conversion on may   the board of directors approved our plan to redeem all of the convertible quarterly income preferred securities that were issued in june on may   we gave the trustee our formal irrevocable notification of our intent to redeem the preferred securities 
this notification provided the holders of the preferred securities days in which to convert their securities into shares of common stock 
upon expiration of the notification period  all remaining securities not converted were redeemed for cash at a premium above liquidation value 
substantially all of the million convertible subordinated debentures outstanding were converted into shares of our common stock during the second quarter of as a result of the conversion  approximately million shares of common stock were issued during the second quarter which resulted in an increase of approximately million to common stock outstanding and an increase of approximately million to additional contributed capital 
since substantially all holders converted their preferred securities to common stock  the loss on extinguishment of this debt was insignificant 
debt repayment in september  we announced our intention to repay the million notes in december  the first call date for the debt 
the notes were issued in november and were repaid in december using cash generated from operations 
we paid a premium of approximately million due to the early retirement of this debt 
approximately million of our million debentures were repaid on february   at the election of the holders 
such election and notification was required to be made between december  and january  at december   we have included the million repaid on february   in short term borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet 
lease extension in july  we amended and extended the lease on our corporate headquarters facility to the total rental payments to be made over the revised lease term are approximately million 
as a result of this extension  we were required to re evaluate the classification of this lease 
based on the terms of the extension  this lease is now classified as a capital lease 
as a result  our long term debt increased by approximately million 
rental business during the third quarter of  we extended a lease relating to a portion of our rental business by six years 
the lease was set to expire on september  instead of paying a balloon payment of approximately million on september   the amount has been financed over a six year term at a fixed rate 
in addition to extending this lease  we reduced the interest rate by approximately percentage points 
during the fourth quarter of  we refinanced a lease relating to another portion of our rental business 
under the terms of the agreement which is effective as of january   the new lease has a six year term and the interest rate is approximately percentage points lower than the existing lease 
the total amount refinanced was approximately million 
both leases were treated as capital leases both before and after the changes

in january  this facility was extended for one year 
as necessary  ctr may transfer a direct interest in its receivables  without recourse  to the financial institution 
to maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold  we sell new receivables to ctr as existing receivables are collected 
receivables sold to ctr in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in receivables  net on our consolidated balance sheets 
the maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of million or the amount of eligible receivables held by ctr 
there are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating  however  the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility 
there was no interest in receivables sold under this program to the financial institution in or and the interest in receivables sold in was not significant 
as of december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under this program 
financing arrangements for related parties in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements  we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures  sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties 
the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices 
certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost  some transfer product to us on a cost plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 
we purchase significant quantities of midrange diesel and natural gas engines  components and service parts from consolidated diesel company cdc  a general partnership that was formed in with j

case case to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity 
cummins and case now cnh global nv are general partners and each partner shares percent ownership in cdc 
under the terms of the agreement  cdc is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners 
each partner is entitled to purchase up to one half of cdc s actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of one half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner s purchase requirement 
the partners are each obligated  unconditionally and severally  to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by cdc  provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced 
the transfer price of cdc s engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period  including interest and financing expenses  but excluding depreciation expense other than scheduled depreciation expense as defined in the agreement 
in addition  each partner is obligated to contribute one half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity  which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee 
to date  neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at cdc 
we are not a guarantor of any of cdc s obligations or commitments 
however  we are required as a partner  to provide up to percent of cdc s base working capital as defined by the agreement 
the amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required  the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by cdc  or we may elect to fund the requirement  although we are under no obligation to do so 
to date  when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount  we have elected to provide that funding to cdc 
if the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount  it is funded equally by the partners 
excess cash generated by cdc is remitted to cummins until cdc s working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount 
any further cash remittances from cdc to the partners are shared equally by the partners 
in the first quarter of  we adopted certain provisions of fin r 
under the provisions of fin r  cdc and another engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us were considered vies and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of these vies by virtue of our pricing arrangements with them and substantial product purchases from them 
as a result  we consolidated the assets and liabilities of cdc and the other engine manufacturer as of march  previously  these joint ventures were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in and advances to equity investees 
first quarter results for these entities were recorded as investee equity  royalty and other income in our consolidated statements of earnings and results for the rest of the year were consolidated in our consolidated statements of earnings 
for a further discussion of the impact of adopting fin r  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives other than for the adoption of new accounting pronouncements as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
there were no accounting policies adopted during that had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap that often require management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs  accounting for income taxes  pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for warranty programs  primarily base warranty  other than product recalls  at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action  which generally occurs when it is announced 
our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates  repair costs and the time of failure 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year  a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for and including adjustments to pre existing warranties 
accounting for income taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets include million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance of million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event our operating performance deteriorates  future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing certain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk  and to a lesser degree in various other countries 
in the uk and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension programs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
sfas requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span  and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
the statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
we adopted sfas as required on december  we did not adopt the measurement date change as it is not required until december  the expected long term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense 
the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years 
the expected rate of return on us pension plan assets used to develop our pension expense was percent for each year ended december    and the expected rate of return on non us pension plan assets was percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
in  we plan to use an expected rate of return of percent for u 
s pension plan assets and percent for non us pension plan assets 
a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and  under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo  amortized over future years of service 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   we had net pension actuarial losses of million and million for the us and us pension plans  respectively 
under sfas the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as these amounts exceed percent of our pbo  the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 
our net periodic pension expense was million in  million in  and million in our net periodic pension expense is expected to be approximately million in the decrease in periodic pension expense is due to higher expected returns on assets driven by the significant pension contributions we made in in addition  our expense is expected to decline as the amortization of prior investment losses begins to be replaced with the amortization of prior investment gains 
another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rate used to develop our net periodic pension expense in the us was percent  percent  and percent for the years ended december    and the discount rate for our non us pension expense was percent  percent  and percent 
we will use percent and percent for us and non us pension expense in changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 
our funding strategy is to fund the plan approximately percent on a pbo basis 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in eitf d which suggests a high quality corporate bond rate 
we used bond information provided by standard poors for the us and iboxx for the us all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and us were high quality  noncallable bonds aa or better as of november  the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to sfas and sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
our model called for years of benefit payments 
for the us plans  the sum of the cash flows from the bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process 
the number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio 
the discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 
in developing the uk discount rate  excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years  thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed 
as a result  the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining 
we made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 
due to the flat shape of the yield curve  this methodology choice impacted the discount rate by less than two basis percentage points 
the discount rate would have been slightly higher had the cash flows been allowed to reinvest 
the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets impact on pension expense increase decrease millions discount rate used to value liabilities percent increase percent decrease expected rate of return on assets percent increase percent decrease the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense 
a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets  including historical returns and input from our external advisors 
the long term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities  fixed income  real estate and other miscellaneous investments 
based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
our three year average rate of return has exceeded percent in each of the last three years 
as a result  based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return assumption of percent per year for us pension assets is reasonable 
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equity risk premium over current long term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations 
our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long term outlook 
therefore  the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long term horizon 
our pension plan asset allocation at december  and  and target allocation for are as follows target allocation percentage of plan assets at december  investment description equity securities fixed income real estate other total actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the pension protection act of the act 
the act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes 
among its many provisions  the act establishes a percent funding target for plan years beginning after december  we may voluntarily make contributions to achieve our funding strategy described above 
during and  we made cash contributions to our pension plans of million and million  respectively  and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately million to million in contributions beyond will depend on the funded status of our plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the act 
the minimum pension liability was eliminated upon the adoption of sfas the estimated accumulated benefit obligation related to the us  uk and several other smaller pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets as of december  and changes in the minimum pension liability decreased our shareholders equity by million  after tax and minority interest  in prior to adopting sfas  additional minimum pension liabilities were reduced by million after tax and minority interest through a direct credit to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the reduction of these liabilities resulted from strong plan asset performance and significant pension contributions in and note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity  the funded status of our plans  the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements and the impacts of sfas annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions 
our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue  operating expenses  working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi year period 
additionally  management must estimate its weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate 
the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value  a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
as of the end of the third quarter in  we performed the annual impairment assessment required by sfas and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
at december   our recorded goodwill was million 
changes in our projections or estimates  a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost related to share based payment transactions 
share based payment transactions within the scope of sfas r include stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
we implemented the revised standard in the first quarter of prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee awards issued after december   using the fair value method preferred by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation as opposed to recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur 
sfas r also requires prospective presentation of the tax benefit on share based awards as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
this standard changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
apb required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this standard requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior years on the income statement 
we currently use the iron curtain method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and roll over methods 
we were required to apply the provisions of sab in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the application of sab did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas  which requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension  retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements 
in addition  sfas requires companies to measure plan assets and liabilities as of the end of a fiscal year rather than a date within days of the end of the fiscal year 
we adopted sfas effective december   except for the change in measurement date provisions which are not effective until total assets  total liabilities  minority interests and total shareholders equity were impacted in the following manner 
total assets increased by approximately million  total liabilities increased by approximately million  minority interests decreased by approximately million and shareholders equity decreased by approximately million 
the adoption of sfas did not impact compliance with any of our financial covenants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
sfas changes certain accounting requirements for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
the new standard also changed certain accounting requirements for interest only and principal only strips and other aspects of accounting for securitized financial assets 
we will adopt sfas effective january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  that provides guidance on accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
subsequent to initial recognition  the company may use either the amortization method or the fair value measurement method to account for servicing assets and servicing liabilities within the scope of this statement 
we will adopt sfas effective january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements  uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
we will adopt fin effective january  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity forward contracts  currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps 
as stated in our policies and procedures  financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes 
our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings  and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant 
the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 
further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed as of december  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates as a result of our international business presence  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions  we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions 
the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 
to achieve this objective  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our million  due in debt from a fixed rate of to a floating rate based on a libor spread 
the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt  with interest paid semi annually 
this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in november  we terminated an interest rate swap relating to our notes that matured in the swap acted as a fair value hedge and converted million notional amount from fixed rate debt into floating rate debt that matured in the termination of this swap resulted in a million gain 
the gain was amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
the amount of gain recognized during and was million and million  respectively 
as of december   there was no longer any deferred gain remaining on our consolidated balance sheets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity prices we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities  we periodically enter into commodity forward contracts with designated banks to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity forward contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities  was million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the forward contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note to the consolidated financial statements
