the company plans to open the branch in the third quarter of also during  we intend to move the wantage branch to its new location site

critical accounting policies our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for december  included herein 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effect cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results may differ from those estimates 
management makes adjustments to its assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate 
the amounts currently estimated by us are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following critical accounting policies encompass the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

index allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense reflects the amount deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio 
management s judgment is based on the evaluation of the past experience of individual loans  the assessment of current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
loan losses are charged directly against the allowance for loan losses and recoveries on previously charged off loans are added to the allowance 
management uses significant estimates to determine the allowance for loan losses 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including current economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows  and other relevant factors 
since the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses is dependent to a great extent on conditions that may be beyond our control  it is possible that management s estimates of the allowance for loan losses and actual results could differ in the near term 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
for example  a downturn in the local economy could cause increases in non performing loans 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could cause some of our loans to become inadequately collateralized 
in either case  this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
additionally  a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively impact earnings 
in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examination  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
they may require additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
future increases to our allowance for loan losses  whether due to unexpected changes in economic conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our future results of operations 
stock based compensation 
the company currently has several stock option plans in place for employees and directors of the company 
prior to january   the company accounted for its stock option plans  under the recognition and measurement provision of apb opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
no stock based employee compensation cost was recognized in the company s consolidated statements of income through december   as all options granted under the company s plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payments 
statement no 
r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise  or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
statement r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to the employees in the income statement 
the revised statement generally requires that an entity account for these transactions using the fair value based method  and eliminates the intrinsic value method of accounting as of january  statement no 
r was effective for periods beginning after december   all public companies must use either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method 
the company adopted the modified prospective method 
using the modified prospective method  the company s expense for stock based compensation related to stock options  net of related tax effect  was  for the year ending december  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has recorded goodwill of million at december  related to the acquisition of tri state insurance agency on october  and thousand from the acquisition of the port jervis  new york branch office on march  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
requires that goodwill is not amortized to expense  but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company periodically assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill will require impairment testing 
the company performs its annual impairment test on the goodwill of tri state in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
if the fair value of the reporting unit 
index exceeds the book value  no write downs of goodwill are necessary 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an additional test is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of goodwill 
the company determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during  and business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumption and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance could result in different assessments of the fair value and could result in impairment charges in the future 
investment securities impairment evaluation 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investments in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value

average time deposits increased to million  an increase of million  or  from million at year end average money market accounts increased to million an increase of million or from million at year end the change in the deposit portfolio reflects continued competition for deposits in our primary market 
in order to attract and retain deposits to fund our growing loan portfolio  the company has had to offer higher rates and emphasize more expensive accounts  such as time deposits and money market accounts  which typically bear higher rates than transactional or savings accounts 
the million increase in average non interest demand deposits is attributed to the company s efforts to cultivate commercial deposit relationships with its commercial loan customers 
lastly the million average balance decrease in savings deposits from million at year end to million at year end represents a shift by our customer s transfer of their deposits from lower yielding savings accounts to a higher earning money market and time deposits

on july   the company raised an additional million  net of offering costs  in capital through the issuance of junior subordinated debentures to a non consolidated statutory trust subsidiary 
the subsidiary in turn issued million in variable rate capital trust pass through securities to investors in a private placement 
the interest rate is based on the three month libor plus basis points adjusted quarterly 
the rate at december  was 
the rate is capped at through the first five years  and the securities may be called at par anytime after july  or if regulatory capital or tax treatment of the securities is substantially changed 
these trust preferred securities are included in the company s and the bank s capital ratio calculations 
equity 
stockholders equity inclusive of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income taxes  was million at december   an increase of million over the million at year end stockholders equity increased due to million in net income earned for  thousand from the issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options  thousand from the shares issued through the dividend reinvestment plan and thousand through the compensation expense of stock options  restricted stock grants and stock awards 
these increases were offset by a thousand decrease in common stock due to the purchase and retirement of treasury shares and cash dividends paid of thousand 
an unrealized gain on securities available for sale  net of income tax  increased stockholders equity by thousand 
liquidity and capital resources it is management s intent to fund future loan demand with deposits and maturities and pay downs on investments 
in addition  the company is a member of the federal home loan bank of new york and at december   had the ability to borrow up to million against its family mortgages and selected investment securities as collateral for borrowings 
the company also has available an overnight line of credit and a one month overnight repricing line of credit  each of an amount of million at the federal home loan bank and an overnight line of credit in the amount of million at the atlantic central bankers bank 
the company has borrowings that consist of advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the company s long term borrowings total million at december  and are secured under terms of a blanket collateral agreement by a pledge of qualifying investment securities and certain mortgage loans 
the borrowings consist of three long term notes that mature on december  each with a convertible quarterly option which allows the federal home loan bank to change the note to then current market rates and one long term note that matures on december   with an initial conversion date of december  and one million amortizing advance that matures on november  the interest rates on these borrowings range from to at december   the amount of liquid assets remained at a level management deemed adequate to ensure that contractual liabilities  depositors withdrawal requirements  and other operational customer credit needs could be satisfied 
at december   liquid investments totaled million  and all mature within days 
at december   the company had million of securities as available for sale 
of these securities  million had thousand of unrealized losses and therefore are not available for liquidity purposes because management s intent is to hold them until market recovery 

index the company s and the bank s regulators have classified and defined bank holding company capital as consisting of tier capital which includes tangible stockholders equity for common stock and certain stock and other hybrid instruments and tier ii capital  which includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses  certain qualifying long term debt and preferred stock which does not qualify for tier i capital 
the company s and the bank s regulators have implemented risk based guidelines which require banks and bank holding companies to maintain certain minimum capital as a percent of such assets and certain off balance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors risk adjusted assets 
banks and holding companies are required to maintain tier i capital as a percent of risk adjusted assets of and tier ii capital as of risk adjusted assets of at a minimum 
at december   the company s tier i and tier ii capital ratios were and respectively 
the bank s tier i and tier ii capital ratios were and  respectively 
in addition to the risk based guidelines discussed above  the company s and the bank s regulators require that banks and bank holding companies which meet the regulators highest performance and operational standards to maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier i capital as a percent of tangible assets of 
for those banks and bank holding companies with higher levels of risk or that is experiencing or anticipating growth  the minimum will be proportionately increased 
minimum leverage ratios for each bank and bank holding company are established and updated through the ongoing regulatory examination process 
as of december   the company had leverage ratio of and the bank had a leverage ratio of 
contractual obligations 
for year end contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period less than more than dollars in thousands total year years years years borrowings operating lease obligations purchase obligations time deposits nonqualified supplemental salary continuation plan junior subordinated debentures total the company has no investment or financial relationship with any unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of capital resources  except for the junior subordinated debentures of sussex capital trust i which are included in the above table 
the company is not aware of any known trends or any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties  which would result in any material increase or decrease in liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the company s financial statements do not reflect off balance sheet arrangements that are made in the normal course of business 
these off balance sheet arrangements consist of unfunded loans and letters of credit made under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
these unused commitments  at december  totaled million 
this consisted of million in commitments to grant commercial and residential loans  million in commercial construction lines of credit  million in home equity lines of credit  and the remainder in other unused commitments 
these instruments have fixed maturity dates  and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon  they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to the company 
management believes that any amounts actually drawn upon can be funded in the normal course of operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  the level of interest rate has a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or change with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  which are affected by inflation 
accordingly  the liquidity  
index interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics of the company s asset and liabilities are more indicative of its ability to maintain acceptable performance levels 
management of the company monitors and seeks to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes by attempting to match the maturities of assets and liabilities to gap  thus seeking to minimize the potential effect of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the two biggest risks faced by the company s operations are interest rate risk and credit quality risk 
see loan and asset quality and allowance for loan losses in item regarding credit quality risk 
interest rate sensitivity 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is the volatility of a company s earnings from a movement in market interest rates 
interest rate gap analysis is a common  though imperfect  measure of interest rate risk 
we do not employ gap analysis as a rate risk management tool  but rather we rely upon earnings at risk analysis to forecast the impact on our net interest income instantaneous and basis point increases in market rates 
in assessing the impact on earnings  the rate shock analysis assumes that no change occurs in our funding sources or types of assets in response to the rate change 
our board of directors has established limits for interest rate risk based on the percentage change in interest income we would incur in differing interest rate scenarios 
through year end  we sought to remain relatively balanced  and our policies provide for a variance of no more than of net interest income  at a and basis point increase or decrease 
at december  the percentage of change were within the policy limits 
our financial modeling simulates our cash flows  interest income and interest expense from earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for a twelve month period in each of the different interest rate environments  using actual individual deposit  loan and investment maturities and rates in the model calculations 
assumptions regarding the likelihood of prepayments on residential mortgage loans and investments are made based on historical relationships between interest rates and prepayments 
commercial loans with prepayment penalties are assumed to pay on schedule to maturity 
in actual practice  commercial borrowers may request and be granted interest rate reductions during the life of a commercial loan due to competition from financial institutions and declining interest rates 
the following table sets forth our interest rate risk profile at december  and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the impact on net interest income illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions
