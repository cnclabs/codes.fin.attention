item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company organized as a delaware corporation in and are engaged in the research and development of cancer therapeutics 
our mission is to research  develop  and commercialize broadly effective  targeted cancer drugs with reduced toxicities compared to conventional cancer chemotherapeutics 
our expertise in molecular biology enables us to understand certain biological processes that are responsible for numerous types of human cancers and to discover novel drug candidates for these diseases 
our chemistry capabilities derived from our history of providing chemistry services for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries enable us to generate product candidates possessing certain pre selected drug like properties and a high degree of specificity for cancer cells 
we believe that these qualities  when present from the earliest stages of product development  increase the likelihood of producing safe  effective and marketable drugs 
our lead products are in clinical stage development 
we are conducting human clinical trials with three product candidates  designated as arq  arq and arq we retain proprietary rights to arq and are developing arq and arq pursuant to a collaboration with hoffmann la roche roche 
arq is the lead product from our cancer survival pathways program 
arq blocks the activity of c met  an enzyme believed to play key roles in human cancer  including cancer cell growth  survival  angiogenesis  invasion and metastasis 
we believe the inappropriate expression of c met in most cancers and its role in controlling multiple signal transduction pathways involved in tumor growth and metastasis render it a highly compelling target for cancer therapy 
arq and arq  the lead products from our activated checkpoint therapy program  are designed to kill cancer cells selectively while sparing normal cells through direct activation of dna damage response checkpoint pathways 
these compounds are believed to activate checkpoint pathways regulated by the ef regulatory protein  thereby restoring the cell s natural defense mechanism against dna damage and initiating the process of apoptosis  or programmed cell death  in these cells 
in addition  we maintain a number of pre clinical programs directed toward molecular targets that we believe play critical roles in the development of human cancers 
the targets  mechanisms of action and chemistry related to compounds generated from these programs differ  offering the potential for multiple therapeutic opportunities 
we are applying a broad spectrum of well established chemistry capabilities developed and validated in the course of multiple collaborations with large pharmaceutical companies to our internal oncology drug discovery and development efforts 
these capabilities are designed to facilitate the progression of our programs from initial discovery through pre clinical development 
in september  we announced a strategic decision to exit our pre existing chemistry services operations in order to focus operationally on developing our oncology portfolio 
revenue from our chemistry services operations terminated in as a result of our strategic decision to no longer provide these services and the subsequent decision by pfizer to terminate its collaborative agreement agreement with us effective may  we did not incur any financial penalty as a result of termination 
we continued to provide chemistry services to pfizer pursuant to the agreement through the effective date of termination 
since december  we produced for pfizer annually an average of approximately  synthetic chemical compounds and received average annual cash payments of approximately million for those compounds and related services 
the agreement provided for six months prior written notice by either party to the other for termination without cause and  in the event of termination by pfizer  certain payments to us 
in accordance with these provisions  we received approximately million in december in connection with the termination 
we considered the chemistry services asset group to be a component of an entity  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  since it comprised operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the remainder of the company s operations 
pursuant to sfas  we reported the results of the chemistry services component as discontinued operations in the year ended december  since their related cash flows were eliminated from our ongoing operations and we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component or the assets that were disposed 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million from inception through december  we expect research and development costs to increase in  due to clinical testing of our lead product candidates 
although we have generated positive cash flow from operations for six consecutive years from  these cash flows were attributable to our discontinued chemistry services operations 
we recorded a net loss for all but one of those years 
we recorded a net loss for and expect a net loss for our revenue consists of development funding from our alliance with roche 
revenue  and expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors  notably the timing and extent of our cancer related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials 
on april  we announced an alliance with roche to discover and develop drug candidates targeting the ef biological pathway  including arq under the terms of the agreement  roche obtained an option to license our ef program in the field of cancer therapy 
roche provided immediate research funding of million  and is providing financial support for ongoing research and development 
under this alliance  we are responsible for advancing drug candidates from early stage development to phase trials 
roche may opt to license worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration by paying an option fee 
assuming the successful development and commercialization of a compound under the program  we could receive up to million in pre determined payments  plus royalties based on net sales 
additionally  we have the option to co promote products in the us liquidity and capital resources december  increase decrease to to in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital in millions cash flow from operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities 
our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices and laboratories  fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies and materials  and professional fees 
the sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services 
in  our net use of cash was primarily driven by the difference between cash receipts from customers  and payments for operating expenses which resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
this amount includes net cash used in discontinued operations of million resulting from our decision to exit our chemistry services operations 
cash flow from investing activities 
our net cash provided by investing activities of million in was comprised of net sales of marketable securities of million and million net proceeds from sale of the assets of our discontinued chemistry services operations 
these sources of cash were partially offset by acquisitions of fixed assets of million 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the company s constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
cash flow from financing activities 
our net cash provided by financing activities of million in was from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of outstanding stock options 
on january   we completed a stock offering in which we sold million shares of common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million after commissions and offering expenses 
on may   we completed a transaction to sell our woburn facility and simultaneously lease the facility from the purchaser 
the lease was subsequently amended on june  under the terms of the transaction  the purchaser obtained two parcels of land and our headquarters building in exchange for a cash payment of approximately million  net of commissions and closing costs 
we are leasing our existing facility and the associated land for a period of ten years at an average annual rental rate of million 
although we were cash flow positive from operations from through  we were not cash flow positive from operations in  nor do we expect to be cash flow positive in  as a result of our decision to exit our chemistry services operations and the increased cost of developing our clinical candidates 
we expect that our available cash and marketable securities  together with cash from operations and investment income  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements until mid  depending on decisions we may make regarding our clinical trials 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into additional corporate collaborations and the terms of such collaborations  results of research and development  unanticipated required capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product 
it is likely we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial  economic and market conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us when required  on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if necessary funds are not available  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate some of our development programs  potentially delaying the time to market for any of our product candidates 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total included in the total minimum payments for operating leases is approximately million related to abandoned real estate in california  net of contractual sublease income 
this net amount has been accrued as a liability as a part of the company s restructuring charge in and subsequently adjusted in and see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
purchase obligations are comprised primarily of outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses and payments to license certain intellectual property to support the company s research efforts 
discontinued operations on september   we announced our intention to exit our chemistry services operations 
we received notice on december  that pfizer had elected to terminate our collaboration agreement  pursuant to its terms  effective may  the agreement provided for six months prior written notice by either party to the other for termination without cause and  in the event of termination by pfizer  certain payments to us 
in accordance with these provisions  we received approximately million in december in connection with the termination 
this amount was recorded as deferred revenue and was recognized as revenue when compounds were delivered through the termination date 
we have fulfilled our compound production obligations under the agreement  recognized the remaining deferred revenue  and ceased chemistry services operations in the net book value of the assets associated with the chemistry services operations  which totaled million  approximated the fair market value of the underlying assets 
in december  we completed the sale of the chemistry services assets for approximately million  net of disposal costs 
we considered the chemistry services asset group to be a component of an entity as defined in sfas since it comprised operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the remainder of the company s operations 
pursuant to sfas  we reported the results of the chemistry services component as discontinued operations in the year ended december  since their related cash flows were eliminated from our ongoing operations and we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component or the assets that were disposed

historically  arqule entered into various collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under which arqule produced and delivered compound arrays and provided research and development services 
revenue elements from collaborative agreements included non refundable technology transfer fees  funding of compound development work  payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting collaborators specific criteria and certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
in each instance  the company analyzed each distinct revenue element of the contract to determine the basis for revenue recognition 
revenue for each element is generally recognized over the period compounds are delivered and or services are performed  provided there is a contractual obligation on behalf of the customer to pay arqule and payment is reasonably assured 
the nature of each distinct revenue element  the facts surrounding the services provided  and arqule s ongoing obligations to provide those services dictate how revenue is recognized for each revenue element 
this accounting conforms to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  in particular  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying the guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can only be considered as separate units of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
eitf became effective for new revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  in february  the company entered into an amended contract with pfizer 
the amendment modified the quantity and composition of compounds to be produced and delivered by arqule  with a corresponding adjustment to the remaining contractual billings for undelivered elements under the contract 
we concluded that the modification was substantial enough to require evaluation of the contract to determine if eitf applied 
we concluded that because the contract does contain multiple deliverables license to technology  research services and compound deliveries eitf did apply 
we determined that there was not sufficient evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements compounds  and therefore the amended contract represented a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
as a result  in q  arqule began treating the amended pfizer agreement as a single unit of accounting and recognizing revenue based on the actual delivery of compounds against the estimated total compound deliveries over the remaining term of the contract 
the total estimated number of compounds that arqule delivered to pfizer was based on management s best estimate  changes in estimates of compounds to be delivered to pfizer could have resulted in adjustments to the amount of revenue we recognized per compound delivered 
we follow these guidelines to measure revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of these policies 
for example  in connection with our pfizer collaboration we have recorded current and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
the estimate of deferred revenue reflects our estimate of the timing and extent of services that we will provide to pfizer 
our services to pfizer  and the timing of those services  were difficult to estimate and were impacted by factors outside of our control 
for example  the timing and quantity of compounds we provided was largely dependent on pfizer s internal needs 
on december   we received notice that pfizer inc  pursuant to the terms of the collaborative agreement agreement with arqule  was terminating the agreement effective may  we have completed our compound production obligations under the terms of the agreement and have ceased chemistry services operations 
compound development revenue was derived from the following contractual elements in  and in thousands non refundable technology transfer payments funding of compound development payments based on delivery of specialized compounds milestone payments total compound development revenue in as a result of the amended pfizer agreement and the adoption of eitf  the company began to account for pfizer revenue as a single unit of accounting 
pfizer revenue in the above table is fully included in payments based on delivery of specialized compounds 
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies 
for additional information  please see the discussion of our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
research and development revenue recognition under the terms of the roche agreement  roche obtained an option to license arqule s ef program in the field of cancer therapy 
roche provided immediate research funding of million  and financial support for ongoing research and development 
arqule is responsible for advancing drug candidates from early stage development into phase trials 
roche may opt to license worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration by paying an option fee 
assuming the successful development and commercialization of a compound under the program  arqule could receive up to million in pre determined milestone payments  plus royalties based on net sales 
arqule considers the development portion of the arrangement to be a single unit of accounting under eitf for purposes of revenue recognition  and will recognize the initial and ongoing development payments as research and development revenue over the maximum estimated development period 
we estimate the maximum development period could extend until december this period may ultimately be shorter depending upon the outcome of the development work  resulting in accelerated recognition of the development revenue 
milestone and royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned 
the cost associated with satisfying the roche contract is included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
restructuring charges credits accruals for abandoned facilities under lease require significant management judgment and the use of estimates  including assumptions concerning the ability of a sublessee to fulfill its contractual sublease obligations 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for the company s abandoned facility in redwood city  california 
the term of the sublease extends through  the remaining term of the company s primary lease 
as a result of signing the sublease  we adjusted our accrual for abandoned facilities to reflect the full amount of the anticipated sublease income to be received 
this assumption about the subleasee s ability to fulfill its contractual obligation is based on an analysis of their financial position and ability to generate future working capital 
if the subleasee is unable to meet its obligations  and the company is unable to enter into another sublease for the facility  arqule may be required to adjust its restructuring accrual and record additional restructuring expense of up to million 
investments in non marketable equity securities at december   we performed an assessment of the fair value of our investment in a privately held proteomics company 
this assessment included analysis of that company s current financial condition  its prospects for generating additional cash flow from operating activities  the current market conditions for raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute our ownership percentage 
as a result of this initial analysis it was our judgment that an impairment had occurred and that the fair value of our investment was million  resulting in a non cash loss on investment of million 
in the second quarter of  events affecting the financial condition of the company caused us to conclude that the fair value of the investment had further declined  and as such  we recorded a non cash loss on investment of million to write off the remaining carrying value of the investment 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we assess our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances a triggering event indicate that the carrying value of a group of long lived assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas on september   we announced our intention to exit our chemistry services operations when we had completed our existing agreement with pfizer in we concluded that our intention to exit our chemistry services operations was a triggering event and that an impairment review was required 
as a result of that review  we determined that the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services operations exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long lived assets attributed to those operations  and therefore there was no impairment in the quarter ended september  on december   we received notice that pfizer had elected to terminate the agreement  pursuant to the agreement s terms  effective may  we concluded that notification from pfizer was also a triggering event and performed a second impairment review 
as a result of this second review  we again determined that the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services operations exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long lived assets attributed to those operations  and therefore there was no impairment in the quarter ended december  based on our decision to exit our chemistry services operations  in we adjusted the depreciable lives on fixed assets used exclusively in those operations in order to fully depreciate the remaining book value of those assets over the remaining period that we will provide services to pfizer 
we were contractually required to perform under the terms of the agreement until may  and  as such  the assets of the chemistry services operations were considered held for use at december  although we were actively seeking a potential buyer for the chemistry services operations  the uncertainty of us successfully completing a sale transaction within one year  or deciding to abandon the assets  precluded us from classifying the assets of the chemistry services operations as assets to be disposed of by sale at december  in the third quarter ended september   it became probable that we would sell the chemistry services operations  eliminate the associated cash flows  and have no continuing involvement in the chemistry services operations 
accordingly  the chemistry services operations was reported as discontinued operations in our statements of operations in accordance with sfas the net book value of the assets associated with the chemistry services operations  which totaled million  approximated the fair market value of the underlying assets 
in december  management completed the sale of the chemistry services assets  which consisted of commercially available laboratory instrumentation for approximately million  net of direct costs to sell such assets 
sale leaseback accounting on may   we completed a transaction to sell our woburn headquarters facility and two parcels of land in exchange for a cash payment of million  net of commissions and closing costs 
simultaneously with that sale  we entered into an agreement to lease back the entire facility and the associated land 
the lease was subsequently amended on june  the amended lease has a term of ten years with an average annual rental rate of million 
we also have options to extend the lease term for up to an additional ten years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  we are applying sale leaseback accounting to the transaction and are treating the lease as an operating lease 
as a result of this transaction  we reduced our net fixed assets by million  representing the net book value of the assets sold on the date of the lease amendment  and realized a gain on the sale of million  which has been deferred and will be amortized over the initial ten year lease term as a reduction in rent expense 
results of operations the following results of operations for the years ended december   and exclude the effect of discontinued operations revenue increase decrease to to in millions research and development revenue as compared to research and development revenue which remained the same in both years is comprised of revenue from roche in connection with the alliance agreement 
as compared to research and development revenue is comprised of revenue from roche in connection with the alliance agreement 
the increase in research and development revenue in was due to our recognizing nine months of revenue from the roche agreement in compared to months of revenue in research and development increase decrease to to in millions research and development overview our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with preclinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  consulting  license  and sponsored research fees paid to third parties and depreciation of associated laboratory equipment 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our portfolio of oncology programs 
we have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a program by program basis 
our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects  and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors 
as a result  we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis  or the cost to support our alliance agreement with roche 
the expenses incurred by us to third parties for preclinical and clinical trials in and since inception of each program were as follows in thousands oncology program current status program to date ef modulation arq phase ef modulation arq phase cancer survival protein modulation arq program phase our future research and development expenses in support of our current and future oncology programs will be subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test potential products in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology  and efficacy 
we then may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product 
it is not unusual for the preclinical and clinical development of these types of products to each take nine years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others  the following the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up to ensure the absence of long term adverse safety events  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad pipeline of products 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
as a result  we believe our future capital requirements and future financial success are not substantially dependent on any one product 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad pipeline of products  our dependence on the success of one or a few products increases 
our strategy includes entering into alliance arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products  such as our collaboration agreement with roche 
in the event that third parties have control over the clinical trial process for a product  the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether our products will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our oncology programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our oncology programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
as compared to the increase in research and development expense in is primarily due to a an increase in outsourced preclinical  clinical and manufacturing costs of million required to advance our oncology programs  principally arq  arq and arq  b an increase in personnel and related costs of million reflecting the hiring of additional scientists and stock based compensation charges recorded in but not  c increased professional fees of million and d increased facility and maintenance costs of million  due to the absorption of these costs  formerly associated with the chemical services operations  by our research and development organization 
at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  up from employees at december  as compared to the increase in research and development expense in is primarily due to an increase of million in the cost of third party services for pre clinical studies  manufacturing and storage of our clinical candidates and the continued conduct of our phase clinical trials 
also contributing to the increase were a increased personnel related costs of million as we continue to add scientists to further our development efforts  b increased laboratory supply costs of million as we continue our experimental testing  and  c increased facility related costs of million that reflects the additional costs to accommodate the increasing research and development headcount in addition to the increase in rental expense associated with the sale and leaseback of our woburn facility in june as of december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  up from employees at december  general and administrative increase decrease to to in millions general and administrative compared to general and administrative expense increased in primarily due to increased personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation expense of million  and due to facility costs of million which are no longer absorbed by the chemical services operations 
general and administrative headcount was at december   compared to at december  compared to general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in  consistent with management s continued efforts to minimize overhead spending 
increases in rent expense associated with the sale and leaseback of the woburn facility were more than offset by lower depreciation expense due to lower capital spending and a lower depreciable asset base and generally lower spending on salaries  employee related costs and corporate insurance 
restructuring related charges credits in millions restructuring charges credits in the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring to shift resources from our chemistry services operations to our internal cancer therapy research 
the restructuring included the termination of staff and managerial employees  or approximately of the workforce  in the following areas in chemistry production positions  in chemistry based research and development positions  and in administrative positions 
in connection with these actions  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the first quarter of for termination benefits  million of which was related to discontinued operations 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for the california facility 
the term of the sublease extends through  the remaining term of the company s primary lease obligation 
as a result of signing the sublease  we reassessed the remaining restructuring accrual and  since the sublease was on terms more favorable than previously estimated  we recorded a million restructuring credit in the third quarter of activities against the restructuring accrual in and were as follows balance as of december  provisions payments balance as of december  facility related balance as of december  provisions payments balance as of december  termination benefits discontinued operations other charges discontinued operations facility related total restructuring accrual the facility related accrual  which represents the difference between our lease obligation for the california facility and the amount of sublease payments it will receive under its sublease agreement  will be paid out through on january   our board of directors authorized termination benefits for employees in connection with a plan of termination for our discontinued chemistry services operations 
the termination benefits  which affected employees  consisted of cash payments and continuation of health care benefits 
in  a restructuring charge of million was recorded pursuant to this action and is included in the consolidated statement of operations as part of income from discontinued operations 
as of december   all affected employees had been separated from the company and the restructuring costs were fully paid 
we anticipate annualized savings in salaries and employee related costs of approximately million as a result of these actions

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
the interpretation requires that we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
if a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition criteria  fin requires the tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement
