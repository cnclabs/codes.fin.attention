item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties described in item a of this report 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to those risks and uncertainties 
overview our business we develop and commercialize scientific business intelligence software for the aggregation  mining  integration  analysis  simulation  management and interactive reporting of scientific data used by biologists  chemists  materials scientists including nanotechnology researchers  and information technology professionals for product design and drug discovery and development 
our technology and services are designed to meet the needs of today s leading research and development organizations 
our customers include leading commercial  government and academic organizations 
many of the largest pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical  and petroleum companies worldwide use our products 
we market our products and services worldwide  principally through our direct sales force  augmented by the use of third party distributors 
our marketplace historically  we have primarily sold molecular modeling and simulation software 
the market for molecular modeling and simulation products in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is challenging due to the maturity of the market  industry consolidation  reduction in the level of discovery research activity  and increased competition  including competition from open source software 
we also sell modeling and simulation products to the chemical  petrochemical and materials industries 
we believe these industries are in the early stages of adoption of these technologies 
thus we believe the market for our products within these industries is nascent and has experienced modest growth over the past several years 
following the acquisition of scitegic  we began to offer data pipelining and workflow software 
this technology is widely applicable within our target industries and represents a significant growth opportunity 
there is currently limited competition to this technology in our targeted industries  which is experiencing growth within our customer base 
our strategy our objective is to be the leader in scientific business intelligence solutions and scientific innovation 
we plan to accomplish this objective by providing a comprehensive set of integrated solutions  built on our industry leading scientific operating platform  that are central to the enterprise wide research and development activities of our customers 
by doing this we will make it easier for research and development organizations to manage data  information  knowledge  and collaborative processes 
our strategy for growth is to expand usage of our products and services by marketing and distributing our solutions to a broader group of users  including scientists  engineers and information technology professionals  within our existing customers  as well as to new customers in other industries 
a key enabler of this strategy is the scientific operating platform we acquired through our scitegic acquisition 
we are utilizing this technology to enable our customers to build solutions which allow them to integrate scientific software and content from across the research and development spectrum 
selling solutions is fundamentally different than our traditional sale of stand alone modeling and simulation products 
we are focused on enhancing our sales processes to emphasize solutions selling and strategic account management 
we are also expanding our professional services capabilities to enable our customers to deploy these solutions 
in addition to the activities underway in our sales and service functions  we continue to focus on the componentization of our entire suite of products on our discovery studio and materials studio platforms 
in fiscal year  we expect to substantially complete the migration of our life sciences applications to the discovery studio platform with the expected launch of a new version of discovery studio by the end of the fiscal year 
the development  release  and timing of any new or upgraded features or functionality for our products remains at our sole discretion 
finally  in addition to our focus on revenue growth  we continuously evaluate our personnel requirements and cost structure 
over the past several years we have significantly reduced our operating costs through workforce reductions and other cost savings measures 
we will continue our focus on cost control  as well as working capital management as we strive to improve our financial performance 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes and the valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we generate revenue from the following primary sources software licenses  provision of post contract customer support and maintenance services on licensed software  collectively referred to as pcs  and professional services 
customer billings generated in connection with our revenue generating activities are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
we then recognize the revenue from these customer billings as set forth below and when all of the following criteria are met a fully executed written contract and or purchase order has been obtained from the customer ie  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contractual price of the product or services has been defined and agreed to in the contract ie  price is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product or service has occurred and no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance of the delivered product or service exist  and collection of the purchase price from the customer is deemed probable 
software licenses 
we license software either perpetually or on a term basis 
our standard perpetual software licensing arrangements include twelve months of bundled pcs  while our standard term based software licensing arrangements typically include pcs for the full duration of the term license 
because we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of these elements  we recognize as revenue the entire fee for such perpetual or term based licenses ratably over the term of the bundled pcs 
certain of our term based licenses also allow the customer to substitute purchased products for other products of equal value throughout the term 
we account for these arrangements as in substance subscriptions and  accordingly  we recognize as revenue the entire fee for such licenses ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement  which is typically the same as the term of the bundled pcs 
renewal of pcs under perpetual software licenses 
our pcs includes the right to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements and technical support 
fees from customer renewals of pcs related to previously purchased perpetual licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the pcs 
professional services 
we provide certain services to our customers  including non complex product training  installation  implementation and other professional services which are non essential to the operation of the software 
when sold separately  revenue from these services is generally recognized as the services are delivered  according to the contractual terms 
amounts billed but not yet recognized as revenue  and other payments received prior to the recognition of revenue  are recorded as deferred revenue 
we also perform professional services for our customers designed to enhance the value of our software products by creating extensions to functionality to address a client s specific business needs 
when sold separately  revenue from these services is recorded under the percentage of completion or completed contract method 
multi element arrangements 
for multi element arrangements which include software licenses  pcs and non complex training  installation  implementation and other professional services which are non essential to the operation of the software  the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the pcs or delivery of the services  whichever is longer 
for multi element arrangements which include software licenses  pcs  non essential services and services that are essential to the operation of the software  the fee for such arrangements is generally deferred until the services essential to the operation of the software have been performed and the modified software has been delivered  at which point the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the pcs or delivery of the non essential services  whichever is longer 
software development costs we account for costs incurred to develop our software products in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
accordingly  costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and significant enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred  until the technological feasibility of the product has been established 
technological feasibility occurs shortly before our software products are available for general release  and we have determined that costs eligible for capitalization are not material 
accordingly  no software development costs were capitalized as of march  and valuation of goodwill our goodwill resulted from acquisitions in fiscal years   and in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned below its carrying value 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in our stock price  a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit 
our goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned exceeds its estimated fair value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
based on the guidance provided by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  management has determined that our company consists of one reporting unit given the similarities of economic characteristics between the operations and the common nature of the products  services and customers 
because we have only one reporting unit  and we are publicly traded  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization as we believe this represents the best evidence of fair value 
our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired was based on a comparison of our net assets as of march  to our market capitalization 
because we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our market capitalization  our future reviews of goodwill for impairment may be impacted by changes in the price of our common stock 
for example  a significant decline in the price of our common stock may cause the fair value of our goodwill to fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of goodwill for impairment that a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
valuation of indefinite lived intangible asset in connection with our acquisition of scitegic in september  we acquired the scitegic trade name which was determined to be indefinitely lived 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment at least annually in our fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the asset below its carrying value 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in our stock price  a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of an asset 
our indefinite lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test and concluded that our indefinite lived intangible asset was not impaired 
we estimated the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis which considers the estimated future customer orders for our scientific operating platform and the associated direct and incremental selling  marketing  and product development costs 
key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis include projections of future customer order growth for our scientific operating platform and developing an appropriate discount rate 
we cannot assure you that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows will materialize as estimated 
for example  if our projections of future customer order growth do not materialize  the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset may fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment that a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 
a long lived asset is considered to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s undiscounted future cash flows  we utilize our internal forecast of our future operating results and cash flows  our strategic business plans and anticipated future economic and market conditions 
there are inherent estimates and assumptions underlying this information and management s judgment is required in the application of this information to the determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
no assurance can be given that the underlying estimates and assumptions utilized in our determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows will materialize as anticipated 
as a result of the closure of our research and development facility in bangalore  india in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we assessed the recoverability of the associated property and equipment and determined that a portion of the assets were not recoverable 
accordingly  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the asset impairment charge of million represents the carrying value of these assets as we expect that any amount we will recover from their disposal will be negligible 
valuation of share based awards we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas no 
r  effective april   using the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  we recognized as a charge against income the estimated grant date fair value of share based awards granted to employees and directors 
we estimate the fair value of our share based stock awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain input variables  as follows expected volatility 
volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award 
we determine volatility based on our historical stock price volatility over the most recent period equivalent to the expected life of the award and the historical stock price volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies  giving consideration to company specific events impacting historical volatility that are unlikely to occur in the future  such as the april  spin off of pdd  as well as anticipated future events that may impact volatility 
risk free interest rate 
our assumption of the risk free interest rate is based on the interest rates on us constant rate treasury securities with contractual terms approximately equal to the expected life of the award 
expected dividend yield 
because we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  we assume a dividend yield of zero 
expected award life 
we determine the expected life of an award by considering various relevant factors  including the vesting period and contractual term of the award  our employees historical exercise patterns and length of service  the expected future volatility of our stock price  tax implications of exercising an award and employee characteristics 
we also consider the expected award lives of comparable publicly traded companies 
for stock purchase plan purchase rights  the expected life is equal to the current offering period under the stock purchase plan 
under sfas no 
r  we are also required to estimate at grant the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre vesting forfeiture rate  and revise the estimate  if necessary  in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs 
we determine the pre vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on our historical pre vesting award forfeiture experience  giving consideration to company specific events impacting historical pre vesting award forfeiture experience that are unlikely to occur in the future as well as anticipated future events that may impact forfeiture rates 
our determination of the input variables used in the black scholes option pricing model as well as the pre vesting forfeiture rate is based on various underlying estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective and are affected by our stock price  among other factors 
changes in these underlying estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of our share based awards and  therefore  the amount of share based compensation expense to be recognized in our results of operations 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of intercompany arrangements to share revenue and costs 
in such arrangements there are uncertainties about the amount and manner of such sharing which could ultimately result in changes once the arrangements are reviewed by taxing authorities 
although we believe that our approach to determining the amount of such arrangements is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final resolution of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax expense or benefit in the period in which such determination is made 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  we expect that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance  or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax reserves 
our reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of our tax audits 
our income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest and penalties 
favorable resolution of such an income tax matter would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense 
we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in the expected realization of our deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
our ability to generate enough taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets depends on many factors  among which are our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies  reversing deferred tax liabilities and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
since our inception  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net us deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not ultimately realize our deferred tax assets 
results of operations our results of operations include the results of operations of scitegic from september   the date of the acquisition 
comparison of the years ended march  and the following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the respective periods years ended march  revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses product development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss revenue revenue decreased to million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the continued growth in the company s scientific operating platform product line  offset by reduced sales of certain legacy products that were deemphasized in connection with the restructuring and product line adjustments that have occurred over the past two fiscal years 
operating costs and expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the year ended march  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased to for the year ended march   as compared to for the year ended march  the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in fulfillment costs of million driven by an increase in fiscal year of electronic software distribution to our customers 
we also incurred approximately million less in royalty costs and distributor commissions  primarily due to a more favorable product mix  but partially impacted by a slight decrease in sales volume year over year 
additionally  a portion of the intangible assets acquired in the scitegic acquisition in september became fully amortized in fiscal year  resulting in a year over year decrease in purchased intangible asset amortization of approximately million 
these amounts were offset by a million increase in share based compensation expense resulting from our adoption of sfas no

as a result of the restructuring  we recognized a charge of million  consisting of million in severance benefits and million in asset impairment and other facility closure costs 
all severance and facility closure costs have been paid as of march  additionally  in fiscal year we incurred additional lease abandonment charges of million and million in severance charges related to restructuring activities originated in previous periods 
in march  we implemented various actions designed to realign our resources with our portfolio of products and services  eliminate redundancies in our workforce and streamline our operations through workforce reductions and abandoning a portion of a leased facility in the united kingdom 
as a result of the implementation of these actions  we recognized a charge of million  consisting of million in severance benefits from the termination of approximately employees and million for our future lease obligations related to the abandoned facility  net of estimated future sublease income 
we anticipate completing the payment of the severance benefits in the first quarter of fiscal year the lease obligation for the abandoned facility terminates in fiscal year net interest and other income net interest and other income was million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the year ended march  net interest and other income was favorably impacted by higher cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during fiscal year  offset by unfavorable fluctuations in the value of the us dollar

loss from discontinued operations on april   we spun off our drug discovery subsidiary  pdd  into an independent  separately traded  publicly held company through the distribution to our stockholders of a dividend of one share of pdd common stock for every two shares of our common stock 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have reported pdd s results of operations  assets and liabilities  and cash flows as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
there were no discontinued operations reported during the year ended march  as pdd was spun off prior to the start of the fiscal year 
during the year ended march   we recognized a loss from discontinued operations of million  or per share  which consisted of revenue of million and expenses of million 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash and marketable securities of million as of march   as compared to million as of march   an increase of million 
significant components of this increase include cash provided by operations of million  an increase in restricted cash and marketable securities of million resulting from the receipt of a subtenant security deposit  proceeds from the sale of common stock of million and a million favorable effect on cash and cash equivalents of changes in foreign currency rates  offset by net purchases of property and equipment of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the year ended march  the reduction in cash flows from operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred revenue  driven in part by the prepayment in fiscal year by a significant customer of future software license fees of approximately million

net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the year ended march  cash flows from financing activities for the years ended march  and consist entirely of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock plans 
we have funded our activities to date primarily through the sales of software licenses and related services and the issuance of equity securities 
we anticipate that our capital requirements may increase in future periods as a result of seasonal sales trends  additional product development activities and the acquisition of additional equipment 
our capital requirements may also increase in future periods as we seek to expand our technology platform through investments  licensing arrangements  technology alliances or acquisitions 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before then 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to continue to generate software sales  the purchase of additional capital equipment and acquisitions of other businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
our forecast for the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is forward looking information  and actual results could vary 
at march   our wholly owned japanese subsidiary  accelrys  kk  recognized an income tax reserve and associated deferred tax asset of million for revenue recognized for japanese income tax purposes in advance of being recognized for book purposes as a result of the change in our revenue recognition policy in connection with the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements 
because this timing difference is temporary  it had no net impact on income tax expense recognized in fiscal year management is currently assessing potential alternative tax return positions that are consistent with japanese tax law and would reduce our income tax obligation in japan 
contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations as of march  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years operating leases  net of subleases minimum royalty payments total for purposes of the contractual obligations table  we have included indefinite lived contractual minimum royalty payments due in the ten fiscal years following fiscal year we are obligated to pay royalties for licenses to enhance and market certain software used in connection with our product offerings 
in addition to the contractual minimum royalties included in the table above  we have several royalty agreements that are long term or perpetual in nature with royalty obligations that are generally based on a percentage of revenues derived from certain software license sales and associated sales of pcs 
the royalty agreements require quarterly payments and generally do not limit the maximum royalties owed 
during the years ended march   and  we incurred royalty expenses of million  million  and million  respectively 
our future annual royalty obligations will vary based on the volume and mix of our product sales and  as a result  may increase in the future 
on april   relating to the spin off of pdd  the landlords of our new jersey facilities  which were used by our pdd operations  consented to the assignment of the leases to pdd 
despite the assignment  the landlords required us to guarantee the remaining lease obligations  which totaled approximately million as of march  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  we recognized a liability and corresponding charge to stockholders equity for the probability weighted fair market value of the guarantee 
changes to the fair market value of the liability are recognized in stockholders equity 
at each of march  and  the liability for our guarantee of the lease obligation was million 
off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions as of march   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
new accounting standards in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas no 
also amends certain provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
we do not expect our adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal year to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly fluctuations in the pound sterling  euro and yen exchange rates 
many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
these transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
the value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because they may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in currency exchange rates 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables  along with the settlement of certain intercompany transactions  are included in the determination of net income 
we analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to reduce the effect of these potential fluctuations 
we do not currently have hedging contracts in effect since exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
the majority of our software license agreements are denominated in us dollars

none of our investments are held for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities due to the relatively short maturities of these investments 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our results of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be a permanent impairment
