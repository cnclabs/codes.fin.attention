executive summary in november  we released rightfax feature pack which offers new features and support for fax boards 
in the second quarter of  we released rightfax which improved server performance  enhanced user experience and improved administration capabilities 
rightfax is the first significant release of this product since november of  when rightfax introduced the new open database architecture 
also in the second quarter  we released captaris alchemy and workflow captaris alchemy includes stronger document control and security  enhanced document history and auditing  a new software developer kit and expanded language support 
workflow  released in  offers a complete workflow development system to enable organizations to standardize and automate business processes 
we derive net revenue primarily from licensing software as well as follow on sales of add on software modules and the sale of maintenance and support agreements 
the driver of our revenue growth over the prior year was attributable to the continuing growth of maintenance  support and service revenue and an increase in the volume of software licenses sold  which we believe to be the result of increased customer deployments of rightfax throughout their organizations 
we expect revenue increases in all three revenue categories  software  hardware  and services in compared to  as a result of increased customer demand from increased investment in our sales organization 
no single customer represented more than of our net revenue for each of the years ended december   or

during  we received million of revenue from a strategic license agreement with xpedite systems  inc xpedite 
a portion of our revenue is derived from strategic license arrangements and this revenue is difficult to predict and has inherent fluctuations based on the partner s own business cycle which may or may not correlate with our business cycle 
our gross margins for increased over  primarily due to increased revenue from maintenance  support and service agreements  and software licenses including the million from xpedite which was margin 
this increase was partially offset by lower gross margins from professional service sales and costs associated with the consolidation of our international product support in we anticipate gross profit as a percentage of revenue for to remain consistent or moderately improve over our gross margins for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december   primarily due to increased sales of our workflow and captaris alchemy lines which contribute higher gross margins compared to the rightfax product line which contributes lower gross margins as it is bundled with lower margin hardware components 
our net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  and a net loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in net income from to was primarily attributable to revenue growth and an overall reduction in operating expenses in in addition  operating expenses included corporate reorganizations charges as well as non cash impairment charges 
we did not incur these charges in the increased loss from to was primarily attributable to lower than expected revenue and to an increase in operating expenses resulting from increased staffing and related costs to support the captaris alchemy product line 
we recognized income tax expense of million on income from continuing operations in the year ended december  we recorded an income tax benefit of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  on losses from continuing operations 
the income tax benefits in and included the reversal of tax liabilities of  and million  respectively  which management determined were no longer probable based on updated information surrounding the related tax returns 
in  we received income tax refunds of million that primarily resulted from the carry back of our net operating loss to our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
our investments are classified as available for sale 
our portfolio consists primarily of money market funds  adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and municipal and us government agency backed securities 
consolidated cash  cash equivalents and investments at december   totaled million  up million from december  this increase was primarily due to our net cash flow provided by operations of million  which includes million of tax refunds that primarily resulted from the carry back of our net operating loss  proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options  as well as excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of million 
these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of our common stock of million and capital purchases of million 
capital expenditures during the year ended december   consisted primarily of an enterprise resource management system to support the growth of our core business activities 
in the first quarter of  we plan to pay out million for management incentive bonuses we accrued in our order fulfillment operations consist primarily of compact disc duplication  documentation fulfillment and distribution of fax boards 
the majority of our products are installed by third parties 
in cases where the customer buys installation services from us  we typically contract with outside vendors to provide full systems integration and assembly 
our rightfax products incorporate a number of commercially available application cards and fax cards that enable integration with certain fax servers 
we currently purchase and resell fax boards from cantata  inc  and dialogic corporation  formerly known as eicon networks corporation 
we depend upon these third party manufacturers to supply fax boards to us 
if our manufacturers terminate their relationships with us or are unable to fill orders on a timely basis or experience quality performance issues  we may be unable to meet customer demand  which would delay or decrease our revenue and our operations may be negatively affected 
our rightfax and captaris alchemy product lines include third party software for which we pay royalties 
our royalty expense was less than of net revenue in and  and of net revenue in we have extensive service offerings that are sold in conjunction with our products  including maintenance  support  professional services and solutions 
all of these offerings are designed to help customers protect and extend their software investment 
we work with resellers and distributors located throughout the world 
these resellers and distributors sell and install our products and they receive discounts based on the volume of sales 
within our selling and marketing groups  we dedicate significant resources to monitoring our resellers and distributors and to generating demand and providing market positioning and support 
utilizing the indirect channel approach provides several advantages  including minimizing the investment in office facilities and personnel in field locations and applying greater resources to sales and implementation efforts 
however  with a channel sales model  
table of contents captaris  inc 
it is more difficult to track the number and locations of all end users utilizing our products 
this also somewhat limits our ability to capture information around product usage  system integration characteristics  and deployment satisfaction directly from the customer s perspective in order to enhance or build new products  solutions and services 
professional services include implementation consulting  training and other service support 
the vast majority of product implementation is performed by our channel partners 
in some instances  customers request high level installation and consulting services directly from us 
in july  in an effort to improve the cost effectiveness and efficiency of our support operations  we centralized our international technical support group 
these changes primarily included a reduction in our workforce and  as a result  we recorded a charge of  for severance payments made in the third quarter of on january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  which  among other things  requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including stock options and deferred stock units 
in  we recorded  in stock compensation expense relating to stock options 
prior to  the company had only shown  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 pro forma financial results including the effects of share based compensation expense in the footnotes to the financial statements 
for the years ended december  and  the pro forma stock compensation expense was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in stock compensation expense in  compared to our pro forma stock compensation expense in and  can be attributed to accelerating the vesting of underwater options in  the reduction in number of shares granted in compared to and and differences between accounting for options under sfas no 
r in and sfas no 
in and in january  we made the decision to incorporate the mobility technology associated with our infinite product line directly into rightfax 
accordingly  in january  we made an end of life announcement of our stand alone infinite mobile delivery product line 
as a result we deemed that the intangible asset related to the infinite technology trade name was impaired and an impairment charge of  was recorded in selling and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of on november   we announced a corporate reorganization intended to improve the efficiency and cost structure of our business 
these changes included a reduction in our workforce and the consolidation of office facilities  which included the impairment of furniture and equipment in those office facilities 
the workforce reduction included certain founders of teamplate  who joined the company when we acquired teamplate  inc in september  and this triggered the acceleration of the remaining teamplate management incentive plan obligation associated with the acquisition 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to this reorganization  of which million was for the teamplate incentive plan obligation   was for severance and other incentive payments for the workforce reduction and  was for the consolidation of office facilities 
in relation to these charges  we recorded million in selling and marketing expenses   in research and development expenses and  in general and administrative expenses 
concurrent with the announcement of the november  reorganization  we announced that we would record a non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of of  which included a  charge for impairment of application systems software projects that would not be completed and  of assets that would be abandoned with the office consolidation 
in relation to these charges   was recorded in selling and marketing expense and  was recorded in general and administrative expenses 
acquisitions and divestitures and we had no acquisitions or significant divestitures during and on october   we acquired information management research  inc imr  an englewood  colorado company 
imr s alchemy product line now marketed as captaris alchemy  which helps organizations capture  archive and retrieve business information enabling us to provide complete solutions for our worldwide enterprise customers 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired imr for a total of million 
we paid million in cash  including transaction costs of million and assumed liabilities of million  net of cash acquired of  the assumed liabilities included million of deferred tax liabilities related to purchased intangibles not deductible for tax purposes  deferred revenue of million and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million 
the acquisition of imr has been accounted for as a purchase 

table of contents captaris  inc 
in connection with the acquisition we consolidated all imr finance and administrative functions to our bellevue headquarters 
as such  as part of the purchase price allocation  we paid  for severance expenses related to the involuntary termination of fourteen imr employees in we acquired teamplate  inc teamplate on september  to expand our business information delivery product offerings as an extension and complement to our existing rightfax product line and to further penetrate the business process automation market workflow 
in connection with the acquisition  we executed an incentive plan that allowed the teamplate management team to earn a minimum of million and up to million over the thirteen quarters following the acquisition  subject to their continued employment and our success in achieving certain revenue performance targets 
in november  we announced a reduction in staff  which included certain founders of teamplate and triggered the acceleration of our remaining minimum incentive plan obligation 
we recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  related to this incentive program and  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on september   we sold the callxpress product line for million to applied voice and speech technologies  inc avst 
concurrent with the transaction  we entered into an earn out agreement with avst which entitles us to receive additional payments of up to million per year for each of the three years following the sale  depending on avst s success in achieving certain revenue targets 
since many activities related to callxpress were shared with the rightfax product line  these earn out payments are classified on our income statements as a reduction to operating expenses in each of the years received 
on march   we received a report from avst and payment of million  confirming achievement of the revenue target for in february of  we received notification confirming that avst had achieved their revenue target for we received a payment of million in march of and accordingly  recorded an additional gain on the sale of the callxpress product line within operating expenses in the first quarter of we sold the assets of mediatel corporation mediatel  our wholly owned subsidiary that operated the medialinq business  our outsource e document services division  on september   for million in cash to xpedite systems  inc xpedite  a division of ptek holdings  inc ptek 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  mediatel s results of operations  net of income taxes  have been classified as discontinued operations 
concurrent with this transaction  we entered into license and reseller agreements with xpedite  under which we licensed our fax to mail technology to xpedite over a three year period following the sale for a minimum aggregate license fee of million 
in  we recognized  of revenue in connection with these agreements 
we did not record any revenue in relating to the license agreement due to a dispute with xpedite relating to the outstanding minimum licenses fee 
in february  we resolved the dispute regarding the revenue relating to as a result  in the first quarter of  we recorded an additional  of revenue related to the commitment and in the third quarter of  we recorded another million of revenue in accordance with the license agreement 
critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates used  including those related to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  useful lives of intangible assets and equipment and leasehold improvements  inventory valuation allowances  revenue recognition  the estimated allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts and income tax accruals 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting judgments and estimates relate to the following areas revenue recognition  
table of contents captaris  inc 
allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value  classification of investments and assessment of related unrealized losses  valuation of acquired businesses  assets and liabilities  impairment of goodwill  impairment of equipment  leasehold improvements  long lived assets and other intangible assets  useful lives of equipment  leasehold improvements and intangible assets  contingencies  stock based compensation plans  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies follow the guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we sell products through resellers  oems and other channel partners  as well as directly to end users 
generally our resellers do not stock product  and except for oem sales described below  we recognize product revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
if a reseller does stock product  we defer this revenue until the reseller sells the software through to end users 
all software licenses are bundled with days of telephone support 
we consider revenue associated with this telephone support to be insignificant  and therefore  we recognize this revenue when the software is shipped and record an estimate for the related cost of the telephone support 
revenue from perpetual software licenses is recognized when the software has been shipped  provided that collection for such revenue is deemed probable 
revenue from term software licenses is recognized over the term of the license  generally twelve months 
whenever a software license  hardware  installation and post contract customer support or pcs elements are sold together  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each element based on its respective fair value  which is the price charged when that element is sold separately 
the amount of revenue assigned to each element is impacted by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vsoe for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition for these items 
revenue for pcs is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  ranging from one to five years 
pcs includes rights to unspecified upgrades and updates  when and if available  and bug fixes 
installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer s site and accepted by the customer 
recognition of revenue from software sold with installation services is recognized either when the software is shipped or when the installation services are completed  depending on our agreement with the customer and whether the installation services are integral to the functionality of the software 
we have entered into agreements with certain oems from which we receive royalty payments periodically 
under the terms of the oem license agreements  each oem will qualify our software on their hardware and software configurations 
once the software has been qualified  the oem will begin to ship products and report net sales to us 
most oems pay a license fee based on the number of copies of licensed software included in the products sold to their customers 
these oems pay fees on a per unit basis and we record associated revenue when we receive notification of the oems sales of the licensed software to an end user 
the terms of the license agreements generally require the oems to notify us of sales of our products within to days after the end of the month or quarter in which the sales occur 
as a result  we recognize the revenue in the month or quarter following the sales of the product to these oems customers 
in general  customers are not granted return rights at the time of sale 
however  historically  we have accepted returns and therefore  we reduce revenue recognized for estimated product returns 
if we do grant return rights and we cannot reasonably estimate returns  we defer the revenue until the return rights lapse 
for software sold to resellers in which we have granted exchange rights  we defer the revenue until the reseller sells the software through to end users 
when customer acceptance provisions are present and we cannot reasonably estimate returns  we recognize revenue upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
professional services are customarily billed at fixed rates  plus out of pocket expenses and revenue is recognized when the service has been completed 
however  if it is determined that a consulting engagement will be unprofitable  we recognize the loss at the time of such determination 
training revenue is recognized when the training is completed 
allowance for sales return 
we estimate potential future product returns related to current period revenue based on our historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
we periodically review the adequacy of our sales returns allowance and underlying assumptions 
if the assumptions we use to calculate the estimated sales returns do not properly reflect future returns  a change in accruals for sales returns would be made in the period in which such a determination was made 
historically  our accruals for sales returns have been adequate 

table of contents captaris  inc 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make ongoing assumptions as to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make estimates based on our historical bad debts  the aging of customer accounts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  if actual credit losses were to fluctuate significantly from the reserves we have established  our general and administrative expenses could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value 
due to rapid changes in technology  it is possible that older products in inventory may become obsolete or that we may sell these products below cost 
when we determine that the carrying value of inventories is not recoverable  we write down inventories to market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  inventory write downs may be required  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
classification of investments and assessment of related unrealized losses 
we classify our short term and long term investments as available for sale 
our portfolio consists primarily of money market funds  adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and municipal and us government agency backed securities 
our portfolio is recorded at fair market value 
we determine the fair value of our investments based on quoted market prices 
investments with legal maturities of one year or less are classified as short term 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method 
we believe that the expected lives of our mortgage backed securities investments are much shorter than the stated maturities due to mortgage refinances and sales of homes 
accordingly  we have estimated the portion of the mortgages likely to be prepaid within one year based on historical prepayment data  current interest rates and other economic factors  and classified a portion of these investments as short term 
unrealized gains and losses  net of any income tax effect  are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
interest income is recorded using an effective interest rate  with the associated premium or discount amortized to interest income over the term of the investment 
we recognize an impairment charge for unrealized losses when an investment s decline in fair value is below the cost basis and is judged to be other than temporary 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial condition and near term business outlook for the investee and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
valuation of acquired businesses  assets and liabilities 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
as of december  our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million 
the determination of the fair value of such intangible assets and goodwill is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions and estimates are based on our best judgments and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the first quarter of the year  and on an interim basis in certain circumstances 
we conducted our annual assessment during the first quarter of and determined our goodwill at march   was not impaired 
no conditions or events have occurred during which would require us to update the assessment 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators include our assessment of the impacts of legal factors  market and economic conditions  the results of our operational performance and strategic plans  competition and market share  and any potential for the sale or disposal of a significant portion of our principal operations 
if we conclude that indicators of impairment exist  we then assess the fair value of goodwill 
our valuation process provides an estimate of a fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow model and includes many assumptions and estimates 
once the valuation is determined  we will write down goodwill to its determined fair value  if necessary 
any write down could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
on november   we announced a corporate reorganization that included the layoff of certain teamplate founders and triggered the acceleration of the remaining teamplate management incentive plan obligation 
during this time we also assessed the effect this layoff had on the valuation of the goodwill recorded with the teamplate acquisition 
it was determined that goodwill was not impaired as a result of this layoff 
impairment of equipment  leasehold improvements  long lived assets and other intangible assets 
we periodically review long lived assets  other intangibles and product lines that we may sell or otherwise dispose of before the end of the asset s previously estimated useful life to determine if there is any impairment of these assets 
we assess the impairment of these assets  or the need to accelerate amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 
table of contents captaris  inc 
of our long lived assets and other intangibles 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the assets should be reviewed to determine their fair value 
we assess the assets for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on a valuation process that provides an estimate of a fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model  which includes many assumptions and estimates 
once the valuation is determined  we will write down these assets to their determined fair value  if necessary 
any write down could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in january  we made the decision to incorporate the mobility technology associated with our infinite product line directly into our rightfax product 
accordingly  in january  we made an end of life announcement of our standalone infinite mobile delivery product line 
as a result  we deemed that the intangible asset related to the infinite technology trade name was impaired and an impairment charge of  was recorded as a selling and marketing expense in december on november   we announced a corporate reorganization that included the layoff of certain teamplate founders and triggered the acceleration of the remaining teamplate management incentive plan obligation 
during this time  we also assessed the effect this layoff had on the valuation of the intangibles related to the teamplate acquisition and determined that the intangibles were not impaired as a result of the layoff 
concurrent with the announcement of the reorganization  we announced that we would record a non cash impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of this impairment charge included  of impairment of application systems software projects that would no longer be completed and  of assets that would be abandoned with the office consolidation 
we do not anticipate future cash expenditures in connection with this impairment 
useful lives of equipment  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
equipment and leasehold improvements  identifiable intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized over their useful lives on a straight line basis 
useful lives for equipment and leasehold improvements are based on our estimates of the period that the equipment or leasehold improvement will be used  which typically range from two to five years 
useful lives for intangible assets are based on our estimates of the period that the intangible assets will generate cash 
changes in estimated useful lives could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
contingencies 
we are periodically involved in litigation or claims  including patent infringement claims  in the normal course of our business 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to record litigation or claim related expenses 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
we accrue for settlements when the outcome is probable and the amount or range of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
in addition to our judgments and use of estimates  there are inherent uncertainties surrounding litigation and claims that could result in actual settlement amounts that differ materially from estimates 
we expense our legal costs associated with these matters when incurred 
stock based compensation plans 
our stock option plans are long term retention programs that are intended to enhance our log term shareholder value by offering opportunities to both directors and officers  as well as selected persons to participate in our growth and success and to provide incentives and encourage retention 
the equity incentive plan formerly the plan on june   at the annual meeting of shareholders of captaris  inc  our shareholders approved the captaris  inc 
equity incentive plan the plan  which amended and restated the captaris  inc restated stock option plan the plan to  among other things  expand the types of awards available for grant to include  in addition to stock options  stock appreciation rights  stock awards  restricted stock  restricted stock units and other stock or cash based awards

r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
concurrent with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to adopt the alternative transition approach provided in staff position no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation under sfas no 
r 
the alternative transition approach includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of stock based compensation  and for determining the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
prior to adopting sfas no 
r  we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing activities 
excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock compensation costs for such options 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  million of excess tax benefits for the year ended december  was classified as a financing cash inflow 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas no

previously under the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 we used the accelerated method of expense recognition pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans fin no 

for all unvested options outstanding as of january   the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense  based on the fair value at the original grant date  will be recognized on an accelerated basis over the remaining vesting period 
for stock based compensation granted subsequent to january   compensation expense  based on the fair value on the date of grant  will be recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
our stock based compensation expense includes expense related to both our stock options and our deferred stock units 
the amount of stock based compensation expense  net of forfeitures  recognized in the quarter and year ended december  was  and  respectively  of which  and  respectively  related to options granted prior to january  total unamortized compensation expense at december  was million  net of estimated forfeitures 
total unamortized deferred compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years 
on september   our compensation committee and board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested stock options granted to our employees and officers under our stock option plans that had an exercise price greater than per share  the closing price of our common stock on september  there were employees affected by this modification 
options held by non employee directors were not included in the acceleration 
previously unvested options to purchase million shares of our common stock became immediately exercisable 
the board also imposed a holding period that requires all executive officers and certain other members of senior management to refrain from selling shares acquired upon the exercise of these options  other than shares needed to cover the exercise price and to satisfy withholding taxes and shares transferred by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution  until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the option s original vesting terms 
the accelerated vesting eliminated future compensation expenses that we would otherwise recognize in our financial statements with respect to these options as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
in accordance with apb no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 no compensation expense was recorded within the financial statements as a result of this modification in because the options had no intrinsic value on the date of the modification due to the exercise price being in excess of the current market price of the stock 
had the options not been accelerated  option expense for the year ended december  would have increased by  net of estimated forfeitures and income taxes  and the unamortized compensation expense for these options would have been  net of estimated forfeitures and income taxes  to be recorded in through during the second quarter of  we offered a limited non compulsory exchange of employee stock options on a less than one for one basis 
the exchange which closed on july  resulted in the voluntary cancellation of employee stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock with varying exercise prices greater than per share in exchange for  employee stock options with an exercise price of 
the option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for a total of  options  representing the  new options granted in the exchange as well as all employee options modified during the year 
variable accounting treatment  in accordance with apb no

accounting for income taxes 
we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  we are required to estimate our potential income tax claims in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish accruals for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes  penalties and interest will be due 
these accruals are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we will establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to allow for the realization of our deferred net tax assets 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of potential tax claims and changes to accruals and valuation allowances that we consider appropriate  as well as the related penalties and interest expense 
in addition to our judgments and use of estimates  there are inherent uncertainties surrounding income taxes that could result in actual amounts that differ materially from our estimates 
any adjustments in our tax provision related to these contingencies could have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow

we continue to sell fax boards and certain types of professional services with a significant number of our software product sales for which we receive a margin significantly less than the margin on our software products 
years ended december  and net revenue for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december  the increase in net revenue was due primarily to the growth of maintenance  support and service agreements and an increase in the volume of our software licenses sold  which we believe to be the result of increased customer deployment of rightfax throughout their organizations 
in addition  million of the increase in revenue was due to a strategic licensing arrangement with xpedite 
this strategic license arrangement began in september in accordance with this arrangement  xpedite agreed to pay a minimum of million over a three year period for a license to use and resell our fax to mail technology 
in september we recognized  of revenue in connection with this arrangement but due to a dispute with xpedite  did not record any revenue in relating to this arrangement 
in february  we resolved the dispute regarding the revenue for as a result  we recorded  of revenue related to the commitment 
during the third quarter of we received an additional million from xpedite 
revenue from our rightfax product line in the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to million from the xpedite strategic licensing arrangement and to the growth of professional services sold and an increase in the volume of rightfax licenses sold resulting from what we believe to be increased capacity needs from existing customers as they further deploy rightfax throughout their organizations

revenue from the captaris alchemy and workflow product lines increased  to million in the year ended december  compared to million the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased international workflow sales 
this increase was partially offset by the decrease in sales of the alchemy product line

year ended december  the overall increase in revenue from our international regions was due to our continued investment and expansion into international markets and to a higher distribution of sales outside north america from our captaris alchemy product line 
we expect the portion of our revenue derived from international markets to remain relatively consistent or improve modestly in we believe that our revenue growth for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was largely attributable to the changes we introduced into the sales channels in  and our continued investments in our sales organizations 
we plan to invest in our sales organization in and as a result of this investment we anticipate that consolidated net revenue will grow at a relatively consistent rate as the growth in historically  our business experiences seasonality with a decline in revenue during the first quarter compared to the prior year s fourth quarter  building gradually during the second and third quarters  and ending with the fourth quarter as our largest quarter for revenue 
we anticipate this pattern to continue in years ended december  and net revenue for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  the increase in net revenue was attributable to revenue from our newer product lines  captaris alchemy and workflow 
we acquired the captaris alchemy product line in october and the workflow product line in september revenue from these product lines increased million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase is due to the inclusion of twelve months of sales from our captaris alchemy product line in compared to two months in and growth of our workflow product line

in the first half of  we believe many of our traditional rightfax resellers increased their emphasis on the new product lines as we integrated the alchemy product line 
other changes included new technology in our rightfax product  reassignment in field support and emphasis on multi product solution selling 
we believe these changes temporarily negatively impacted revenue from the rightfax product line  as the resellers focused on training and integrating the new products into their product lines 
we anticipated training and similar transitional activities with our partners  however  we believe these activities took longer and had a greater impact on rightfax product revenue than we expected

we expect overall research and development expenses to remain relatively flat in absolute dollars in compared to as we continue to maintain our investments in research and development

the rollover approach quantifies misstatements based on the amount of the error in the current year financial statement whereas the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the misstatement s year s of origin 
financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
sab no 
is effective for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after november   therefore  we have adopted sab no 
for the period ended december  the adoption of sab no 
does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is permitted  provided the company has not yet

 but do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to market risk  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of our investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of investment grade interest bearing securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the interest bearing securities in our portfolio are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels at december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would be approximately  because we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we do not expect our operating results  financial condition or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency risk currently  substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 
we price certain international sales to the united kingdom in british pounds sterling  to canada in canadian dollars  to australia in australian dollars and to participating european community countries in euros 
increases in the value of the dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region  leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region 
as we continue to expand our international operations  we expect our non us dollar denominated revenue and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions to increase 
we do not currently engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of currency fluctuations  but we may do so in the future 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency translation fluctuations associated with our assets and liabilities denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars  euros and british pounds sterling 
the objective in managing these foreign currency translation exposures is to minimize the risk through minimizing the level of activity and financial instruments denominated in those currencies 
our foreign currency financial instruments primarily consist of cash  trade receivables  trade payables  accrued expenses and intercompany loans 
for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net asset position  a strengthening us dollar would result in less net assets when converted to us dollars 
conversely  for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net liability position  a weakening in the us dollar would result in more net liabilities when converted to us dollars 
historically  we have not hedged our transaction or translation risks on these currencies 
we have the ability to hold our foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and do not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would have a material impact on future results of operations or cash flow 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the underlying foreign currency exposures described above 
the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a  loss in fair values of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at december
