item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business combination on june   we completed the acquisition of sieger engineering  inc  a privately held contract manufacturing company based in south san francisco  california uct sieger 
the total purchase price was approximately million and was comprised of cash consideration of million  including acquisition costs of million  and stock consideration of million 
our subsidiary  uct sieger  is a supplier of chemical mechanical planarization cmp modules and other critical subsystems to the semiconductor  solar and flat panel capital equipment industries 
we believe that the acquisition has enhanced our strategic position as a semiconductor equipment subsystem supplier 
we have accounted for the acquisition of uct sieger as a business combination and the operating results of uct sieger have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
see note in item notes to consolidated financial statements 
general we are a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems  primarily for the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
we develop  design  prototype  engineer  manufacture and test subsystems which are highly specialized and tailored to specific steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
currently  our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of gas delivery systems 
we have recently increased our revenue related to the sale of other critical subsystems  including cmp modules  chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  frame assemblies and process modules 
our primary customers are semiconductor equipment manufacturers 
historically the majority of semiconductor equipment manufacturers were vertically integrated 
however  as they place greater emphasis on their core competencies  process development and innovation  they rely more heavily on outsourcing the design  development and manufacturing of many of the subsystems that comprise the semiconductor manufacturing equipment they produce 
as the requirements they place on their subsystem suppliers increase and the scope of the subsystems they outsource expands  semiconductor equipment manufacturers seek to consolidate their supplier relationships into a reduced number of integrated solution providers 
we provide our customers complete subsystem solutions that combine our expertise in design  test  component characterization and highly flexible manufacturing operations with quality control and financial stability 
this combination helps us drive down total manufacturing costs  reduce design to delivery cycle times and maintain high quality standards for our customers 
we believe these characteristics  as well as our standing as a leading supplier of gas delivery systems  place us in a strong position to benefit from the growing demand for subsystem outsourcing 
the majority of our products consist of gas delivery systems 
our other critical subsystems  related to semiconductor manufacturing equipment  include cmp modules  chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  
table of contents frame assemblies and process modules 
we operate clean room manufacturing facilities in menlo park and south san francisco  california  austin  texas  tualatin  oregon  and shanghai  china 
we have in the past considered and will continue to consider acquisitions that will enable us to expand our geographic presence  secure new customers and diversify into complementary products and markets as well as broaden our technological capabilities in semiconductor capital equipment manufacturing 
fp ultra clean  llc  an entity controlled by francisco partners  lp  owned a controlling interest in our outstanding common stock until the first quarter of pursuant to an amended and restated stockholders agreement with fp ultra clean  llc and former sieger shareholders  as long as fp ultra clean  llc owned a certain percentage of our outstanding common stock  they were entitled to certain financial information from us 
as of february   fp ultra clean  llc had holdings in our outstanding common stock 
cyclical business our business and operating results depend in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors  which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical  with recurring periods of over supply of semiconductor products that have had a severe negative effect on the demand for capital equipment used to manufacture semiconductors 
during these periods  we have experienced significant fluctuations in customer orders for our products 
our sales were million in  million in and million in in periods where supply exceeds demand for semiconductor capital equipment  we generally experience significant reductions in customer orders for our products 
sharp decreases in demand for semiconductor capital equipment may lead our customers to cancel order forecasts  change production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production  which may negatively impact our gross profit  as we may be unable to quickly reduce costs and may be required to hold inventory longer than anticipated 
in periods where demand for semiconductor capital equipment exceeds supply  we generally need to quickly increase our production of gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems  requiring us to order additional inventory  effectively manage our component supply chain  hire additional employees and expand  if necessary  our manufacturing capacity 
customer and geographic concentration a relatively small number of oem customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue  and we expect this trend to continue 
applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc as a group accounted for of our sales in  of our sales in and of our sales in because of the small number of oems in our industry  most of whom are already our customers  it would be difficult to replace lost revenue resulting from the loss of  reduction in  cancellation of or delay in purchase orders by  any one of these customers 
consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business in a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
in addition  any significant pricing pressure exerted by a key customer could adversely affect our operating results 
we have had to qualify  and are required to maintain our status  as a supplier for each of our customers 
this is a lengthy process that involves the inspection and approval by a customer of our engineering  documentation  manufacturing and quality control procedures before that customer will place volume orders 
our ability to lessen the adverse effect of any loss of or reduction in sales to an existing customer through the rapid addition of one or more new customers is minimal because of these qualification requirements 
consequently  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected by the loss of  or any reduction in orders by  any of our significant customers 
in  and   and  respectively  of our total sales were derived from sales outside the united states  based upon the location to which our products were shipped 

table of contents critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales  inventories  intangible assets  stock compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  business combinations  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill and equity incentives to employees to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenue is concentrated in a few oem customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and flat panel display industry 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  no right of return of delivered products and no customer acceptance provisions 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we ship the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the product 
in arrangements which specify title transfer upon delivery  revenue is not recognized until the product is delivered 
in addition  if we have not substantially completed a product or fulfilled the terms of the agreement at the time of shipment  revenue recognition is deferred until completion 
determination of criteria in the third and fourth bullet points above is based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the amounts charged for the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts 
we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of  and do not require collateral from  our customers 
we have not experienced significant collection losses in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to assess collectability 
inventory valuation we value the majority of our inventories at the lesser of standard cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we value inventory from our recently acquired subsidiary  uct sieger  at the lesser of actual cost or market 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
the inventory write downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specific identified inventory in excess of established usage 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold either as a component of a subsystem or as separate inventory 
for the years ended december  and we wrote off million and million  respectively  in inventory determined to be obsolete 

table of contents accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of tax deductions  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
in determining whether the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  we make judgments with respect to whether we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowance to impair our tax assets because  based on the available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets in the future 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin and are therefore unable to estimate the impact on our consolidated financial statements at this time 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets such as trade name and customer relationships 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
when evaluating the sieger acquisition  customer relationships were valued using the income approach and assumptions about cash flows from these relationships 
other assumptions include a attrition rate for larger customers  a attrition rate for smaller customers and a discount rate of 
the trademark and trade name were valued using the relief from royalty method  based on a royalty rate of of gross revenues  a useful life of year  and a discount rate of 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets include goodwill  customer lists and tradename 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the provisions of sfas no 
also require a goodwill impairment test annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  the provisions of sfas no 
require the application of a fair value based test at the reporting unit level 
we operate in one segment and have one reporting unit 
therefore  all goodwill is considered enterprise goodwill and the first step of the impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires a comparison of our fair value to our book value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the book value  sfas no 
requires an estimate of the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the business  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
this estimate requires valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in process research and development and developed technology 
potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon this two step process 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 

table of contents equity incentives to employees on january   we began to account for our employee stock purchase plan espp and employee stock based compensation plan in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial account standards r accounting for stock based compensation  sfas r  which requires recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of stock based compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in the consolidated income statements 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  and fasb interpretation fin  no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  fin and made footnote disclosures as required by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  sfas 
accordingly  no compensation was recognized for purchase rights issued through the employee stock purchase plan or employee stock based awards granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
rather  we disclosed pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements as required by sfas the pro forma income calculations were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model

the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  the public company accounting oversight board  or pcaob  and the nasdaq global market  have required changes in the corporate governance practices of public companies 
these new rules and regulations have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made our legal  accounting and administrative activities more time consuming and costly

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  increased million to million 
the increase was due primarily to our acquisition of sieger and higher levels of capital expenditures relating to domestic cleanroom expansion activities and investment in a new erp system 
in addition to our normal general capital expenditures  in  we expect to invest approximately million for leasehold and capital equipment for our second manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
cash for this investment will be provided from existing cash and operations 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  increased million to million from million in the year ended december  we generated cash primarily through bank borrowings and stock issuance  including approximately million in net proceeds from our secondary stock offering of million shares of common stock conducted in march cash provided by financing activities was used primarily to fund the acquisition of sieger 
we anticipate that our operating cash flow  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  capital lease obligations  expansion plans and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
borrowing arrangements in connection with our acquisition of uct sieger in the second quarter of  we entered into a borrowing arrangement and an equipment loan with two commercial banks 
the loan agreement under the borrowing arrangement with one bank provides senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  consisting of a million revolving line of credit million of which may be used for the issuance of letters of credit and a million term loan 
the aggregate amount of the credit facilities is also subject to a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
each of the credit facilities will expire on june  and contain certain financial covenants  including minimum profitability and liquidity ratios 
in addition  the term loan is subject to monthly amortization payments in equal installments 
the interest rate on one of the outstanding loans under the credit facilities is based on a financial ratio established by the lender and provides an interest rate at prime plus or prime plus 
interest rates under the credit facilities ranged from to per annum during the year ended december   and ranged from to per annum as of december  the equipment loan is a year  million loan that is secured by certain equipment

recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize in the consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin will be effective as of the beginning of the our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues tax force eitf issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  eitf 
eitf requires disclosure of accounting policy regarding the gross or net presentation of point of sales taxes such as sales tax and value added tax 
if taxes included in gross revenues are significant  the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented should also be disclosed 
eitf will be effective for the first annual or interim reporting period after 
table of contents december  we do not expect that the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings only if material under the dual method 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  the adoption of sab did not impact our consolidated financial statements

 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  rather  it applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we will adopt sfas no

we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates or equity prices 
foreign exchange rates during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a loan and security agreement providing for revolver loans of up to million with a bank in china 
as of december   the balance outstanding under a revolver loan was million 
if we enter into future borrowing arrangements or borrow under our existing revolving credit facility  we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate changes by using a mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt  together with interest rate swaps where appropriate  to fix or lower our borrowing costs 
we do not make material sales in currencies other than the united states dollar or have material purchase obligations outside of the united states  except in china where we have purchase commitments totaling million in united states dollar equivalents 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent movement in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates applied to the underlying exposures described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
although we do not anticipate any significant fluctuations  there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange risk will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow in the future 
interest rates our interest rate risk relates primarily to our third party debt which totals million and carries interest rates pegged to the libor and prime rates 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase our interest expense by approximately  per quarter 
this would be partially offset by increased interest income on our invested cash 
conversely  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates would decrease our interest expense by approximately  per quarter 
this would be partially offset by decreased interest income on our invested cash
