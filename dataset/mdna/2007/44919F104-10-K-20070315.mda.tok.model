item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business overview we are a healthcare services management company focused on delivering solutions for those suffering from alcoholism and other substance dependencies 
we research  develop  license and commercialize innovative physiological  nutritional and behavioral treatment protocols 
we offer disease management programs for substance dependence built around our proprietary prometa treatment protocols for alcoholism and dependence to stimulants 
treatment with our prometa protocols  which integrate behavioral  nutritional and medical components  are available through physicians and other licensed treatment providers who have entered into licensing agreements with us for the use of our protocols 
we also manage or license prometa centers  medical practices that focus on offering treatment with the prometa protocols for dependencies on alcohol  cocaine and methamphetamines 
our prometa based disease management programs allow healthcare providers who license our technology to offer an integrated approach for the treatment of substance dependence that can be tailored for the specific needs of patients with medical and psychiatric comorbidities 
we have invested significant resources for business development  sales  marketing  research  development and other activities in order to implement commercial operations and establish market penetration 
our revenues are growing and we anticipate they will continue to grow significantly due to increases in the level of private pay patients from existing licensees and prometa centers greater numbers of managed care and government providers adopting our protocols based on successful results from commercial pilots and scientific studies expansion into new markets such as managed care 
we have been unprofitable since our inception in and expect to continue to incur operating losses for some time 
however  we believe our operating losses will decrease and we will achieve positive cash flows within the next two years as the number of patients treated with prometa continues to increase 
accordingly  our historical operations and financial information are not necessarily indicative of future operating results  financial condition or ability to operate profitably as a commercial enterprise 
compcare acquisition on january   we acquired a majority controlling interest in comprehensive care corporation compcare through the acquisition of woodcliff healthcare investment partners  llp 
effective as of our acquisition of woodcliff  our consolidated financial statements will include the business and operations of compcare as our majority owned  controlled subsidiary 
compcare  primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary  comprehensive behavioral care  inc  provides managed care services in the behavioral health and psychiatric fields 
compcare manages the delivery of a 
table of contents continuum of psychiatric and substance abuse services to commercial  medicare and medicaid members on behalf of employers  health plans  government organizations  third party claims administrators  and commercial and other group purchasers of behavioral healthcare services 
the customer base for compcare s services includes both private and governmental entities 
since february  we have had a marketing agreement with compcare under which compcare has the right to offer our protocols as part of a disease management offering to its customers and other mutually agreed parties on an exclusive basis 
we believe our relationship with compcare will create synergies and efficiencies allowing us to more effectively and efficiently facilitate adoption and use of our protocols among treatment populations managed or reimbursed by third party payers  such as managed care  primarily through a disease management offering 
compcare provides an infrastructure to offer this prometa based disease management  to enable healthcare providers to offer an integrated approach for the treatment of substance dependence 
on january   we entered into a merger agreement with compcare  amended january   pursuant to which we would acquire the remaining outstanding shares of compcare in exchange for shares of our common stock 
however  two stockholder class actions were filed in the delaware court of chancery seeking to enjoin the proposed merger 
if the litigation is resolved quickly on reasonable terms  the merger should be consummated in the second quarter 
if we determine we are unlikely to settle the litigation on acceptable terms within a reasonable period of time  the parties will likely terminate the merger agreement by mutual written consent 
in that event  compcare will continue as our majority owned  controlled subsidiary for the foreseeable future 
we believe we can effectuate substantially all of the benefits of our relationship with compcare under our current operational structure 
prometa our prometa protocols are unique treatment protocols for alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine dependence that integrate physiological  nutritional  and psychosocial therapies  designed to help patients meet their individual recovery goals 
prometa protocols are specifically designed to target key neuroreceptors to help relieve cravings and improve cognitive function  restore nutritional balance  and initiate psychosocial counseling  so that patients can fully engage in the entire recovery process 
our two proprietary prometa treatment protocols  one for alcohol dependence and the other for stimulant dependence or a combination of alcohol and stimulant dependence  incorporate fda approved oral and iv medications used off label and separately administered in a unique dosing algorithm 
the pharmacologic intervention is integrated with nutritional support and the selection and initiation of psychosocial therapy 
as a result  our prometa protocols represent an innovative approach to substance dependence designed to address physiological  nutritional  and psychosocial aspects of the disease  and are thereby intended to offer patients an opportunity to achieve sustained recovery 
we believe that our business and operations as outlined above are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
however  the healthcare industry is highly regulated  and the criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation by various federal and state legislatures  courts  enforcement and regulatory authorities 
clinical studies are underway to evaluate our protocols and confirm reports from physicians using them in their practices 
only a treating physician can determine if prometa is appropriate for any individual patient 
the medications used in the prometa treatment protocols are fda approved for uses other than treating dependence on alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine 
therefore  the risks and benefits of using those medications to treat dependence on those substances have not been evaluated by the fda  which may not find them to be sufficiently safe or effective 
we do not manufacture  distribute or sell any medications and have no relationship with any manufacturers or distributors of medications used in the prometa protocols 
our future prospects are subject to the legal  regulatory  commercial and scientific risks outlined above and in item a risk factors 
our strategy our business strategy is to provide quality treatment protocols that will become the standard of care for those suffering from alcoholism and other substance dependencies at a lower overall cost than traditional treatment approaches 
we intend to grow our business through increased utilization from within existing and new licensees  additional prometa centers  and increased adoption of our prometa protocols and substance abuse disease management treatment approach by government agencies  criminal justice systems  managed care and other third party payers 

table of contents key elements of our business strategy include expanding the base of our licensed treatment sites  focusing on existing service areas increasing the number of dedicated prometa centers in major us markets demonstrating the potential for improved clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness associated with using the prometa treatment protocols  through commercial pilot studies with key managed care and other third party payers leveraging existing and initiating new pilot studies with governmental agencies to accelerate the adoption and funding by criminal justice  state and local government systems providing our substance abuse disease management program to managed care health plans for reimbursement on a case rate or capitated basis  utilizing the compcare infrastructure to provide basic managed care services seeking additional scientific and clinical research data to further validate the efficacy of using the prometa protocols through unrestricted grants for research studies by leading research institutions and preeminent researchers in the field of alcohol and substance abuse exploring opportunities in foreign markets where our prometa patents have issued expand number of licensees in us we will focus on expanding our presence in the us private payer market by targeting existing service areas  and licensing our protocols and providing our services to additional healthcare providers in those areas 
furthermore  we will provide our licensees with a comprehensive level of added value services to enhance their ability to communicate the scientific rationale and clinical relevancy of the prometa protocols 
our primary focus will be in major metropolitan service areas where we have already established a market presence in order to leverage our site managers  marketing efforts and brand awareness of prometa and benefit from resulting treatment volumes on a cost effective basis without capacity constraint 
in february we launched a new nationwide team of field personnel focused on increasing awareness and utilization of the prometa protocols among physicians and allied health professionals specializing in the treatment of substance dependence 
our national field organization comprises a total of individuals  prometa clinical consultants pccs and site managers 
site managers will service our nationwide footprint of over prometa licensed sites in markets  having primary responsibility to enable our licensees to increase utilization from within their practice 
pccs will also serve the existing licensed sites by communicating the scientific rationale and clinical relevancy of the treatment protocols to a broader targeted audience in order to enhance our existing licensees ability to increase their prospective prometa patient flow 
additionally  we now have six dedicated business development directors to work closely with our site managers and pccs in an effort to quickly identify new potential licensees and execute broad strategies for increasing the visibility of the licensed sites within their respective regions 
as additional data from research studies become available  we plan to expand our marketing initiatives to more aggressively educate the professional community eg  physicians  counselors  therapists  payers and other allied professionals 
this staged strategic approach to our marketing efforts takes into account i the potential benefits of increasing physician and patient awareness of prometa ii that a more robust data dossier will facilitate broader adoption of prometa by patients and the treatment community 

table of contents prometa centers in december  david e 
smith  md  a renowned addiction medicine specialist and founder of the haight ashbury free clinics  opened the first prometa center  a new medical practice operating in a state of the art outpatient facility in santa monica  california  and in january  opened a second prometa center in san francisco  both of which are located in medical office space that we leased and built out 
under the terms of a full business service management agreement with dr 
smith s professional corporation  the prometa center  inc  we manage the business components of the practice and license the prometa protocols and use of the name in exchange for management and licensing fees 
the medical practice has a focus on offering treatment with the prometa protocols for dependencies on alcohol  cocaine and methamphetamines  and also offers medical interventions for other substance dependencies 
under generally accepted accounting principals  the revenues and expenses of the prometa center  inc are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in january  a new prometa center medical practice was opened in new jersey  managed by the canterbury institute 
under the terms of our licensing agreement with canterbury  we will receive fees for services and technology licensing and a share of the profits made by canterbury from its owned or managed prometa centers 
canterbury plans to manage an additional prometa center to be opened in boca raton  florida in the second quarter of based on the success of this business model  our strategy is to license or manage additional prometa centers in major markets in the us  including markets currently served only by prometa licensees over the next two years 
managed care we plan to continue positioning prometa with managed care providers and disease state management programs with the goal of becoming a covered benefit under managed care programs 
pilots with major health plans now underway to conduct commercial evaluations of our prometa protocols as a central component for substance dependence disease management are expected to be completed this year 
we believe our association with compcare creates synergies to facilitate the use of our prometa treatment protocols by managed care treatment providers and provide access to an infrastructure for our substance abuse disease management offerings 
key strategies and benefits expected from our association with compcare include the following a network of  compcare providers that can increase the potential referral base and availability of prometa at treatment sites 
compcare currently manages approximately million member lives  of these approximately million are on a cost risk basis 
compcare s infrastructure already in place to provide substance abuse dependence disease management to accommodate nationwide third party reimbursement that we expect will be driven by positive outcomes from prometa pilots currently underway with managed care entities healthnow new york inc and horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey  and various criminal justice systems 
capturing additional managed behavioral health revenues from initial disease management reimbursement on the high utilizer subset of the substance dependent populations from compcare s existing managed care relationships 
we currently estimate high utilizers represent an average of of plan lives 
further revenue growth within these plans would be expected based upon expanding penetration beyond this level into the broader substance dependent population  coupled with revenues from demonstrated medical savings 
we also anticipate that there will be opportunities to provide add on behavioral health disease management products  especially for disorders that commonly occur with substance abuse  which  in turn  will continue to increase our revenue base within these plans 
a substance dependence disease management infrastructure to accommodate initial treatment volumes from government and criminal justice systems and is expected to facilitate utilization and adoption of prometa by various managed care entities  criminal justice systems  self insured employers  and government agencies 

table of contents an immediate ability to provide access to treatment through compcare s provider network and infrastructure to managed lives for customers evaluating the system wide adoption of the prometa protocols without the need for lengthy implementation cycles 
we will provide greater access to treatment with our patented protocols in the context of a disease management program  which integrates physiological  nutritional and psychosocial treatment  while concurrently coordinating the treatment of co existing medical and behavioral disorders  resulting in a higher level of care for the individual patient 
we anticipate an acceleration of licensing new providers due to availability of reimbursement and the ability to increase private pay revenue growth through the licensing of provider networks 
in november  we announced that horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey will conduct a commercial evaluation of the prometa protocols as a central component for substance dependence disease management 
horizon bcbsnj has a total membership in excess of million lives 
fifty patients will receive treatment with the prometa protocols for alcoholism  stimulants  and alcoholism and stimulants 
outcomes will be measured at ninety days  after which initial reimbursement may commence  with additional follow up extending through six months 
in january  we announced that healthnow new york inc  the parent company of bluecross blueshield of western new york and blueshield of northeastern new york  will conduct a commercial evaluation of the prometa protocols as a central component for substance dependence disease management 
the pilot will take place in the chemical dependency unit of tlc health network  a healthnow care provider 
healthnow has a total membership in excess of  lives 
fifty patients will receive treatment with the prometa protocols for alcoholism  stimulants  and poly addiction to alcohol and stimulants 
outcomes will be measured at ninety days  with additional follow up extending through six months 
endpoints that will be evaluated in the pilot include the ability to rapidly transition individuals back to their families and employers by converting their care to an out patient treatment modality as soon as feasible 
criminal justice systems and government agencies drug and alcohol offenders impact all divisions of criminal justice including law enforcement  drug courts  probation  and correctional facilities 
according to a bureau of justice statistics bulletin  prisoners in  published in october  approximately of the million state and of the  federal prisoners were convicted of drug offenses 
a significant number of state and federal prisoners receive alcohol treatment in prison or during the re entry period while under community supervision 
the office of national drug control policy ondcp estimates that more than of the sentenced federal inmate population will have a diagnosable substance disorder that requires some type of drug abuse treatment program 
city  county  state and federal criminal justice systems are in need of a more beneficial and convenient treatment alternative 
more importantly  we will seek to work with local  state and federal criminal justice systems to intervene prior to incarceration or in conjunction with reentry programs with a goal of reducing the number of drug offenders admitted into prison 
drug courts first came to prominence in as a means to deal with the growing number of offenders involved with substance abuse 
according to the national drug court institute there were over  drug courts in located in all states 
drug courts generally require participants to undergo treatment in lieu of incarceration 
we will seek to engage and educate all parties judges  attorneys  physicians  counselors  treatment providers who influence the selection of the drug treatment programs and funding 
we began to establish prometa as a covered treatment for city  state and county agencies in the public and criminal justice sectors in several states in and early  building on outcomes data from the dr 
urschel methamphetamine study and commercial pilot studies of the prometa protocols that were conducted in the prometa protocols for the treatment of methamphetamine and cocaine dependence were adopted as a treatment by pierce county alliance in  based on the encouraging results of a pilot program 
pierce county 
table of contents alliance began treating patients involved in the pierce county criminal justice system in august and pierce county alliance is currently seeking additional funding from pierce county and the state of washington 
the city court of gary adopted the prometa protocol after terminating its stimulant dependent pilot study prior to completion specifically because the interim results surpassed the court s historical success rates 
we view the pierce county alliance and gary drug court adoptions of the prometa protocols as important milestones and as references for our efforts in the criminal justice system 
we believe the results of these and other pilots will serve as a template to increase adoption of the prometa protocols throughout the public and criminal justice systems of these states  as well as other states throughout the country 
there are currently additional commercial pilots being conducted by treatment providers and courts in criminal justice populations in other states and we anticipate that additional pilots will commence in clinical data from research studies a key to our success will be the publication of results from research studies evaluating treatment with the prometa protocols conducted by leading research institutions and preeminent researchers in the field of alcohol and substance abuse 
studies that are pending  underway or completed to date include a patient multi site  randomized double blind placebo controlled study of the prometa protocols for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence conducted by dr 
walter ling of ucla a patient randomized double blind placebo controlled study of the prometa protocol s acute and immediate effects on cravings and cognition in alcohol dependent subjects designed and supervised by renowned alcoholism researcher  dr 
joseph r 
volpicelli of the university of pennsylvania  and conducted by the institute of addiction medicine s dr 
jenny starosta an patient randomized double blind placebo controlled study of the prometa protocol s acute and immediate effects on cravings and cognition in methamphetamine dependent subjects designed and supervised by dr 
harold urschel  and conducted by research across america a patient randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled study of the prometa protocol for the initiation  and extension of abstinence of alcoholism conducted by dr 
raymond anton at medical university of south carolina a patient open label randomized controlled study of the prometa protocols in the treatment of alcohol dependence conducted by dr 
jeffery wilkins at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles an patient randomized double blind placebo controlled study of the prometa protocols acute and immediate effects on cravings and cognition in alcohol dependent subjects conducted by dr 
jeffery wilkins at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles a patient open label study of the physiological component of the prometa protocol for methamphetamine dependence conducted by dr 
harold urschel that was completed in  in which it was reported that more than of study participants experienced a significant clinical benefit measured through decrease in cravings  reduction of methamphetamine use and treatment retention after treatment  with no adverse events a patient pharmacoeconomic study to be conducted by the parallax center in new york city to compare outcomes achieved with the prometa protocol for alcohol dependency to the treatment program s current protocol 
in february  sheryl smith phd  a leading researcher in the field of neurosteroids  provided evidence supporting a mechanism of action underlying our prometa protocols at the neurobiology of addiction conference 
dr 
smith presented data from her research on methamphetamine dependent rats  describing the 
table of contents methamphetamine induced increase in the a subunit of the gabaa receptor and the post treatment decrease of this pathological marker  which has been associated with states of hyper excitability and anxiety 
this receptor dysregulation and associated symptomatology has previously been associated with alcohol and neurosteroid withdrawal in animal studies  and suggests a common cause of cravings in substance dependent individuals 
dr 
urschel s study  which is being followed up by a double blind study  is significant  as we believe it provides formal third party validation of prometa 
methamphetamine and cocaine dependence are top priorities at the state and drug court levels  and because of the similar pathophysiologies of these drugs  a treatment validated for one may be readily adopted for the other 
the positive results anticipated from the above studies will further validate prometa as a recommended treatment option for alcohol and stimulant dependence  as well as serve to accelerate our growth 
international operations we have received allowances  issuances or notices that patent grants are intended for inventions related to one or more of our protocols for the treatment of alcohol and stimulant dependence in mexico  australia  new zealand  singapore  south africa  russia  ukraine and europe 
we intend to consider opportunities in these and other countries where our intellectual property is protected 
in  our swiss foreign subsidiary signed prometa license and services agreements with three sites in switzerland to serve the international market 
the sites in switzerland commenced operations in the first quarter of other international operations to date have not yet been significant  consisting primarily of treatment of dependencies on a pilot basis  legal and other development and start up activities 
we will continue to evaluate the success of these initial programs before we pursue additional international expansion 
our operations we commenced operations in july and signed our first licensing and administrative services agreement in november under our licensing agreements  we provide physicians and other licensed treatment providers access to our prometa protocols  education and training in the implementation and use of the licensed technology and marketing support 
we receive a fee for the licensed technology and related services generally on a per patient basis 
as of december   we had licensing agreements with physicians  hospitals and treatment providers for approximately sites throughout the united states  with sites contributing to revenues in we continue to enter into agreements with additional healthcare providers to increase the availability of the prometa protocols 
as revenues are generally related to the number of patients treated  key indicators of our financial performance will be the number of facilities and healthcare providers that license our technology  and the number of patients that are treated by those providers using our prometa protocols 
since july  approximately  patients have completed treatment using our prometa protocols at our licensed sites  and in research studies and commercial pilots being conducted to study our protocols 
we manage two prometa centers opened by david e 
smith  md in southern california in december and san francisco in january whose revenues and expenses are included in our consolidated financial statements  and license a third prometa center opened by the canterbury institute in new jersey in january canterbury plans to open an additional prometa center in south florida in the second quarter of to date  primarily self pay patients have been treated with the prometa protocols 
we expect revenues from third party payers will increase as a result of successful pilot studies completed and currently underway with state programs  managed care providers and criminal justice systems to evaluate the results of using of the prometa protocols in their programs 
positive results from these studies will help in our efforts to increase third party reimbursement for providers using our protocols 
furthermore  our association with compcare will enable us to create synergies to facilitate the use of our prometa treatment protocols by managed care treatment providers and provide an infrastructure for our substance abuse disease management offerings 
we do not operate our own healthcare facilities  employ our own treating physicians or provide medical advice or treatment to patients 
we provide services and access to tools that physicians may use to treat their patients as they determine appropriate 
the hospitals  licensed healthcare facilities  and physicians that contract for the use of 
table of contents our technology own their facilities or professional licenses  and control and are responsible for the clinical activities provided on their premises 
patients receive medical care in accordance with orders from their attending physicians 
physicians with license rights to use the prometa protocols exercise their independent medical judgment in determining the specific application of our protocols  and the appropriate course of care for each patient 
following the medical portion of the treatment procedure  physicians  local clinics and healthcare providers specializing in drug abuse treatment administer and provide the psychosocial component of the protocol 
our market substance dependence is a worldwide problem with prevalence rates continuing to rise despite the efforts by national and local health authorities to curtail its growth 
substance dependence disorders affect many people and have wide ranging social consequences 
in an estimated million americans aged and older suffered from alcohol or other forms of drug abuse or dependence  of which million  or  received some kind of treatment  according to the national survey on drug use and health published by the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa  an agency of the us department of health and human services 
furthermore  according to the survey  approximately million americans age and older  or percent of the population  are reported as having tried methamphetamine  and the percentage of methamphetamine use characterized as abuse or dependence increased from to findings from the treatment episode data set teds published by samhsa s office of applied studies show that the proportion of hospital admissions for primary abuse of methamphetamine as a percent of substance abuse treatment admissions increased from in to in it is commonly reported that addiction to methamphetamine is an epidemic rapidly spreading throughout the us methamphetamine addicts are highly resistant to treatment and  even after intervention  relapse at very high rates 
methamphetamine use is also spreading to the workplace 
a study funded by the wal mart foundation in determined that each methamphetamine using employee costs his or her employer  per year in terms of lost productivity  absenteeism  higher healthcare costs and higher workers compensation costs 
for city  state and county governments and their taxpayers  methamphetamine abuse causes legal  medical  environmental and social problems 
a study entitled the criminal effect of meth on communities conducted in by the national association of counties  which surveyed counties in states  reported that of counties surveyed reported methamphetamine as their largest drug problem  with reporting increases in arrests involving methamphetamine starting three years ago 
cocaine was reported as the number one drug problem in of the counties 
there are currently no generally accepted medical treatments for cocaine or methamphetamine dependence 
summarizing data from the ondcp and the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaa  the economic cost of alcohol and drug abuse exceeds billion annually in the us  including billion in healthcare costs and approximately billion in productivity losses 
despite these staggering figures  it is a testament to the unmet need in the market that only of those who need treatment actually receive help 
traditional treatment methods are often not particularly effective  especially when it comes to those who are dependent on stimulants 
often faith  willpower  and counseling are the only options available 
compounding the lack of efficacious treatment options is the enormous stigma of leaving one s life  income  and loved ones for weeks at a time to seek inpatient treatment 
there are approximately  facilities reporting to samhsa that provide substance abuse treatment on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
historically  the disease of substance dependence has been treated primarily through behavioral intervention  with fairly high relapse rates 
samhsa s teds report states that in only of those treated for alcoholism and of those treated for cocaine completed detoxification  and that alcohol and cocaine outpatient treatment completion rates were only and  respectively 
for patients who do complete treatment  the niaaa reports relapse rates three months following treatment for alcohol dependence to be 
relapse rates are higher for those suffering from cocaine dependence as opposed to alcohol 
for the behavioral treatment of cocaine dependence  the drug abuse treatment outcome study reports a relapse rate of one year following outpatient treatment lasting or fewer days and one year following long term residential treatment lasting or fewer days 

table of contents pharmacological options for alcohol dependence exist and a number of pharmaceutical companies have introduced or intend to introduce drugs to treat alcohol dependence 
these drugs may require chronic or long term administration 
in addition  several of these drugs are generally not to be used until the patient has already achieved abstinence  are generally administered on a chronic or long term continuing basis  and do not represent an integrated treatment approach to addiction 
substance dependence as a disease scientific research indicates that not only can drugs interfere with normal brain functioning but can also have long lasting effects that persist even after the drug is no longer being used 
data indicates that at some point changes may occur in the brain that can turn drug and alcohol abuse into substance dependence a chronic  relapsing and sometimes fatal disease 
those dependent on drugs may suffer from compulsive drug craving and usage and be unable to stop drug use or remain drug abstinent without effective treatment 
professional medical treatment is often necessary to end this physiologically based compulsive behavior 
we believe that addressing the physiological basis of substance dependence as part of an integrated treatment protocol will improve clinical outcomes  reduce the cost of treating dependence  and reduce the cost to society by decreasing related criminality and violence and mitigating the costs associated with high risk behavior 
methamphetamine according to a national institute on drug abuse nida research report methamphetamine abuse and addiction january  the effects of methamphetamine use can include addiction  psychotic behavior  and brain damage 
the damage to the brain caused by methamphetamine use is similar to damage caused by alzheimer s disease  stroke  and epilepsy 
methamphetamine is highly addictive and users trying to abstain from use may suffer withdrawal symptoms that include depression  anxiety  fatigue  paranoia  aggression  and intense cravings for the drug 
chronic methamphetamine use can cause violent behavior  anxiety  confusion  and insomnia 
users can also exhibit psychotic behavior including auditory hallucinations  mood disturbances  delusions  and paranoia  possibly resulting in homicidal or suicidal thoughts 
according to nida s report methamphetamine linked to long term damage to brain cells march  use of methamphetamine can cause damage to the brain that is detectable months after the use of the drug 
alcohol the centers for disease control and prevention rank alcohol the number three preventable cause of death in the united states  at  deaths in according to niaaa  of all deaths due to liver cirrhosis are alcohol related  with most of these deaths occurring in people to years old 
one study found that to of all emergency room trauma cases involve alcohol use roizen  j  alcohol and trauma  
another study found that of asymptomatic alcoholic men exhibited evidence of cardiomyopathy rubin  e  the effects of alcoholism on skeletal and cardiac muscle  
the consequences of alcoholism and alcohol abuse affect most american families 
one study estimated that of all injury related hospital admissions are the result of alcoholism or alcohol problems waller j  diagnosis of alcoholism in the injured patient  
according to the national commission against drunk driving  nearly  americans are injured in alcohol related traffic crashes each year  resulting in  fatalities 
cocaine and crack cocaine cocaine and crack use are societal problems that place a heavy load upon our criminal justice system 
according to a bureau of justice statistics bulletin  prisoners in  published in october  of the  federal prisoners and of the million state prisoners were convicted of drug offenses 
the national institute of justice reports that over of all arrestees test positive for cocaine or crack 
the consequences of cocaine and crack use extend beyond the criminal justice system 
nida reports the medical complications of cocaine use to include heart arrhythmias and heart attacks  chest pain and respiratory 
table of contents failure  strokes  seizures  and headaches  as well as abdominal pain and nausea 
nida also notes that there have been no medications available to treat cocaine dependence 
our solution prometa protocols those suffering from alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine dependence have a clinical disease  but are often characterized as having social disorders or a lack of self discipline 
in this context traditional treatment approaches have generally focused on the psychosocial aspect of the disease 
while we believe the psychological approach to substance dependence treatment is important  we recognize that a more comprehensive approach to this multi factorial disease should be addressed as part of an integrated treatment approach intended to provide patients with an improved chance for recovery 
we believe our integrated approach will offer patients an opportunity to achieve their individual recovery goals  and provide a sustainable commercial opportunity for our shareholders 
current research indicates that substance dependence is associated with altered cortical activity and changes in neurotransmitter function in the specific areas of the brain which are critical to normal brain function 
moreover  changes in the neurochemistry of the brain may underlie the hallmarks of substance dependence  including tolerance  withdrawal symptoms  craving  decrease in cognitive function and propensity for relapse 
our prometa protocols include medically directed and supervised treatments  prescription medications and nutritional supplements  combined with psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy 
we provide a proprietary integrated treatment protocol to medical professionals 
the specific implementation of the protocols is at the discretion and judgment of the medical professionals providing care and tailored to individual patient needs 
the prometa treatment protocols provide for a comprehensive physical examination  including specific laboratory tests  prior to initiation of treatment by the treating physician  to determine if the patient is appropriate for the prometa protocol prescription medications delivered in a unique dosing algorithm a nutritional plan and recommendations  designed to help facilitate and maintain the other aspects of recovery one month of prescription medications and nutritional supplements following the initial treatment individualized psychosocial counseling or other recovery oriented counseling the initiation of treatment under the prometa protocols involves the oral and intravenous administration of pharmaceuticals in a medically directed and supervised setting over a period of three days 
the medications used in the prometa treatment protocols have been approved by the food and drug administration fda for uses other than treatment of substance dependence 
treatment generally takes place on an outpatient basis at a properly equipped outpatient setting or clinic  or at a hospital or other in patient facility  by physicians and licensed healthcare providers who have licensed the rights to use our prometa protocols 
the outpatient nature of the treatment provides the opportunity for the care to be provided in a discreet manner and without long periods away from home or work 
the prometa protocol for stimulant dependence provides for a second  two day administration at the facility  which takes place about three weeks after initiation 
following the initial three days  our protocols provide that patients receive one month of prescription medication  nutritional supplements  nutritional guidelines designed to assist in recovery  and individualized psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy 
initial clinical observations by our licensed treatment providers suggest that the prometa protocols may improve cognitive function be associated with higher initial completion rates than conventional treatments reduce cravings which can be a major factor in relapse allow patients to more quickly engage in counseling or other forms of psychosocial therapy in a meaningful way 

table of contents these initial conclusions have been reported in the treatment of approximately  patients at licensed sites and in research studies and commercial pilots being conducted to study our protocols 
they may not be confirmed by formal double blind  placebo controlled research studies  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance of our protocols 
we believe the prometa protocols may offer an advantage to traditional alternatives for several reasons treatment provided using the prometa protocols is designed to address a spectrum of patient needs  including physiological  nutritional and psychological elements in an integrated way the prometa treatment protocols include medically directed and supervised procedures designed to address neurochemical imbalances in the brain thought to be caused or worsened by substance dependence 
the rationale for the approach is that by addressing the underlying physiological balance thought to be disrupted by substance dependence  dependent persons may be better able to address the behavioral psychological and environmental components of their disease treatment using the prometa protocols generally can be performed on an outpatient basis and do not require long periods away from home or work the prometa protocols may be initiated by physicians and treatment providers at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can complement other treatment modalities additionally  we provide training  education and other administrative services to assist physicians  healthcare providers and facilities with staff education  marketing and administrative support 
competition conventional forms of treatment for alcohol dependence are usually divided into phases detoxification  which is typically conducted in medically directed and supervised environments  rehabilitation  which is often conducted through short or long term therapeutic facilities or programs  most of which do not offer medical management options  and relapse prevention aftercare that is provided via structured outpatient treatment programs 
most medically managed treatments require long term usage of pharmaceuticals  resulting in low patient compliance 
conventional forms of treatment for stimulant dependence generally consist only of relapse prevention psychosocial and recovery oriented therapy  conducted through therapeutic programs 
regardless of the approach  there is great variability in the duration of treatment procedures  level of medical supervision  price to the patients and success rates 
one currently accepted practice for detoxifying patients from dependence on alcohol consists of heavily sedating the patient at an inpatient hospital facility for a period of to days 
due to the heavy sedation  the patient may need to be further observed for an additional to days 
this procedure  while medically necessary to prevent severe complications  eg seizures or delirium tremens when withdrawing these patients from alcohol  does not consistently relieve the patient s cravings or otherwise attempt to address the long term recovery of the patient 
further  the drugs typically used during this procedure the most commonly utilized medications are valium diazepam  ativan lorazepam  and xanax alprazolam can be addictive  require a time intensive dose tapering and washout period  and may cause side effects 
while withdrawal from cocaine or methamphetamine dependence is not considered to be life threatening  withdrawal symptoms can be quite unpleasant and may lead to repeated relapses and treatment failures 
detoxification procedures typically involve the use of sedatives to assist patients through this difficult period 
following treatment  environmentally cue induced cravings  however  are especially pronounced and may re occur for months to years 

table of contents treatment programs there are approximately  facilities reporting to the substance abuse and mental health services administration samsha that provide substance dependence medical treatment services on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
well known examples of residential treatment programs include the betty ford center  caron foundation  hazelden and sierra tucson 
in addition  individual physicians may provide substance dependence treatment in the course of their practices 
there appears to be no readily available reliable information about the success rates of these programs  nor agreed upon standards of how outcomes should be measured eg  self reported abstinence or reduction in days of heavy drinking 
many of these traditional treatment programs have established name recognition and their treatments may be covered in large part by insurance or other third party payers 
to date  treatments using our protocols have generally not been covered by insurance  and patients treated with the prometa protocols have been substantially self pay patients 
traditional treatment approaches for substance dependence focus mainly on group therapy  abstinence  and behavioral modification  while the disease s underlying physiology and pathology is rarely addressed  resulting in fairly high relapse rates 
currently therapies are beginning to target brain receptors thought to play a central role in the disease process 
we believe that our prometa protocols offer an improvement to traditional treatments because the integrated prometa protocols are designed to target the pathophysiology induced by chronic use of alcohol or other drugs in addition to nutritional and psychosocial aspects of substance dependence 
the abnormalities in brain function induced by chronic substance dependence may take weeks to years of drug abstinence to return to normal function  if at all 
we believe the prometa protocols offer an advantage to traditional alternatives because they provide an integrated treatment methodology that is discreet  mildly sedating and that can be initiated in only three days  with a second two day treatment three weeks later for addictive stimulants 
our prometa protocols also provide for one month of prescription medication and nutritional supplements  integrated with psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy 
we further believe the short initial outpatient treatment period when using our prometa protocols is a major advantage over traditional inpatient treatments and residential treatment programs  which typically consist of approximately to days of combined inpatient detoxification and recovery in a rehabilitation or residential treatment center 
the prometa protocols do not require an extensive stay at an inpatient facility 
rather  the protocols offer the convenience of a three day treatment addictive stimulants require a second two day treatment three weeks later and can generally be administered on an outpatient basis 
this is particularly relevant since approximately of adults classified with dependence or abuse are employed  and loss of time from work can be a major deterrent for seeking treatment 
moreover  we believe the prometa protocols can be used at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can complement other forms of alcohol and drug abuse treatments 
as such  our protocols offer a potentially valuable alternative or addition to traditional behavioral or pharmacotherapy treatments 
treatment medications there are currently no generally accepted medical treatments for methamphetamine dependence 
anti depressants and dopamine agonists have been investigated as possible maintenance therapies  but none have been fda approved or are generally accepted for medical practice 
several classes of pharmaceutical agents have been investigated as potential maintenance agents eg  anti depressants and dopamine agonists for cocaine dependence  however  none are fda approved for treatment of cocaine dependence or widely generally accepted in medical practice 
their effects are variable in terms of providing symptomatic relief  and many of the agents may cause side effects or may not be well tolerated by patients 
there are a number of companies developing or marketing medications for reducing craving in the treatment of alcoholism 
these include the addiction medication naltrexone  an opiate receptor antagonist  is marketed by a number of generic pharmaceutical companies as well as under the trade name revia  for treatment of alcohol dependence 

table of contents however  naltrexone must be administered on a chronic or continuing basis and is associated with relatively high rates of side effects  including nausea 
alkermes has developed and is marketing a long acting injectable form of naltrexone  vivitrol  intended to be administered by a physician via monthly injections 
the company reported results from a phase iii clinical study indicated that in the overall study population  patients treated with vivitrol mg experienced approximately a reduction in the rate of heavy drinking relative to placebo 
alkermes  in partnership with cephalon  made vivitrol commercially available in the us in june forest laboratories holds the license in the us to market campral delayed release tablets acamprosate calcium  approved by the fda in acamprosate is an nmda receptor antagonist 
the product must be taken two to three times per day on a chronic or long term basis 
clinical studies supported the effectiveness in the maintenance of abstinence for alcohol dependent patients who had undergone inpatient detoxification and were already abstinent from alcohol  but the product was not effective for patients who had not undergone detoxification and who were not abstinent prior to treatment 
many medications marketed to treat alcohol or drug dependence are not administered until the patient is already abstinent  require long term chronic administration and must be taken several times a day to achieve the desired effect 
as noted above  we believe the prometa protocols represent an integrated approach to treatment that includes medical  nutritional and psychosocial components that can be used at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can complement other existing treatments 
as such  our protocols offer a potentially valuable addition to traditional medical treatment 
moreover  because treatment with the prometa protocols is an integrated treatment  we do not view the current medical therapies as directly competitive and in some cases may be used in conjunction with our protocols 
we believe that the total cost of providing treatment using the prometa protocols falls within the typical range of prices for conventional treatment programs 
we also believe  based on the limited initial results discussed above  that treatment using our protocols may have higher completion rates  greater compliance  reduction or elimination of cravings  improved cognitive functioning and potentially lower relapse rates 
development of our technology much of our proprietary  patented and patent pending substance dependence technology  known as the prometa treatment protocols  was developed by dr 
juan jos legarda  a european scientist educated at university of london who has spent most of his professional career conducting research related to substance abuse 
through his studies and research  dr 
legarda identified some of the adverse physical effects of substance abuse on the brain and began to develop technologies that specifically focused on the neurochemistry of the brain as a core part of addictive behavior modification 
in  dr 
legarda filed patent cooperation treaty pct applications in spain to protect treatment protocols that he developed for dependencies to alcohol and cocaine 
we acquired the rights to these patent filings in march through a technology purchase and license agreement with dr 
legarda s company  tratamientos avanzados de la adiccion sl  to which we pay a royalty of three percent of the amount the patient pays for treatment using our protocols 
after acquiring these rights  we filed us patent applications and other national phase patent applications based on the pct filings  as well as provisional us patent applications to protect aspects of additional treatment protocols for alcohol  cocaine and other addictive stimulants 
in december  we announced that we received a notice of allowance for hythiam s us patent for treating cocaine dependency from the united states patent and trademark office 
this patent represents a significant corporate milestone and we anticipate it will also serve to enhance protection of the intellectual property underlying our prometa protocols 
we have also received allowances  issuances or notices that patent grants are intended for our core intellectually property for the treatment of alcohol and stimulant dependence in mexico  australia  new zealand  singapore  south africa  russia  ukraine and europe 
once patents are issued  they generally will expire years from the dates of original filing 

table of contents proprietary rights and licensing our success depends upon a number of factors  including our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
to help ensure compliance with our license joint venture agreements  we employ site managers in each of our major markets 
we have the following branded trade names hythiam hythiam logo prometa prometa logo prometa protocol prometa protocols prometa treatment protocol prometa treatment protocols prometa center prometa centers prometa treatment prometa treatments we impose restrictions in our protocol license agreements on our customers rights to utilize and disclose our technology 
we also seek to protect our intellectual property by generally requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements and by restricting access to our proprietary information 
we require that  as a condition of their employment  employees assign to us their interests in inventions  original works of authorship  copyrights and similar intellectual property rights conceived or developed by them during their employment with us

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this report  including the risk factors listed below 
risks and uncertainties in addition to those we describe below  that may not be presently known to us  or that we currently believe are immaterial  may also harm our business and operations 
if any of these risks occurs  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed  the price of our common stock could decline  and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history  and expect to continue to incur operating losses  making it difficult to evaluate our future prospects we have been unprofitable since our inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next twelve months 
as we continue to grow  our historical operations and financial information are not necessarily indicative of our future operating results  financial condition or ability to operate profitably as a commercial enterprise 
we may not be able to achieve positive cash flows before our existing cash reserves are expended 
revenues may not increase as quickly as anticipated  and changes in our business strategy  technology development or marketing plans or other events affecting our operating plans and expenses may result in the expenditure of existing cash before we achieve positive cash flow 
if this occurs  our ability to meet our cash obligations as they become due and payable will depend on our ability to delay or reduce operating expenses  sell securities  borrow funds or some combination thereof 
we may seek additional funding through public or private 
table of contents financing or through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners 
we may not be successful in raising necessary funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may fail to successfully manage and maintain the growth of our business  which could adversely affect our results of operations continued expansion could put significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
the need to comply with the rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq global market will continue to place significant demands on our financial and accounting staff  financial  accounting and information systems  and our internal controls and procedures  any of which may not be adequate to support our anticipated growth 
we may not be able to effectively hire  train  retain  motivate and manage required personnel 
our failure to manage growth effectively could limit our ability to satisfy our reporting obligations  or achieve our marketing  commercialization and financial goals 
our treatment protocols may not be as effective as we believe them to be  which could limit our revenues and adversely affect our business our belief in the efficacy of our treatment protocols is based on a limited number of studies and commercial pilots that have been conducted to date  and our initial experience with a small number of patients 
such results may not be statistically significant  have not been subjected to close scientific scrutiny  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance and safety of treatment with our protocols 
controlled scientific studies  including those that have been announced and planned for the future  may yield results that are unfavorable or demonstrate that treatment with our protocols is not clinically effective or safe 
if the initially indicated results cannot be successfully replicated or maintained over time  utilization of our protocols could decline substantially 
our protocols may not become widely accepted  which could limit our growth further marketplace acceptance of our protocols may largely depend upon healthcare providers interpretation of our limited data  the results of pending studies  or upon reviews and reports that may be given by independent researchers 
in the event such research does not establish our treatment technology to be safe and effective  it is unlikely we will be able to achieve widespread market acceptance 
our industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully the healthcare business in general  and the substance dependence treatment business in particular  are highly competitive 
we compete with many types of substance dependence treatment methods  treatment facilities and other service providers  many of whom are more established and better funded than we are 
many of these other treatment methods and facilities are well established in the same markets we target  have substantial sales volume  and are provided and marketed by companies with much greater financial resources  facilities  organization  reputation and experience than we have 
the historical focus on the use of psychological or behavioral therapies  as opposed to medical or physiological treatments for substance dependence  may create further resistance to penetrating the substance dependence treatment market 
there are a number of companies developing or marketing medications for reducing craving in the treatment of alcoholism  including the addiction medication naltrexone  an opiate receptor antagonist  is marketed by a number of generic pharmaceutical companies as well as under the trade name revia  for treatment of alcohol dependence 
vivitrol  a long acting injectable form of naltrexone intended to be administered by a physician via monthly injections 
alkermes reported results from a phase iii clinical study indicating that in the overall study population  patients experienced approximately a reduction in the rate of heavy drinking relative to placebo 
campral delayed release tablets acamprosate calcium  an nmda receptor antagonist taken two to three times per day on a chronic or long term basis 
clinical studies supported the effectiveness in the maintenance of abstinence for alcohol dependent patients who had undergone inpatient detoxification and were already abstinent from alcohol 

table of contents our competitors may develop and introduce new processes and products that are equal or superior to our protocols in treating alcohol and substance dependencies 
accordingly  we may be adversely affected by any new processes and technology developed by our competitors 
there are approximately  facilities reporting to the substance abuse and mental health services administration that provide substance abuse treatment on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
well known examples of residential treatment programs include the betty ford center  caron foundation  hazelden and sierra tucson 
in addition  individual physicians may provide substance dependence treatment in the course of their practices 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of which could impact the ability to manage our business our future success depends on the performance of our senior management and our key professional personnel  in particular our chairman and chief executive officer  terren s 
peizer  our senior executive vice presidents  richard anderson  christopher s 
hassan and anthony m 
lamacchia  and our chief financial officer  chuck timpe 
each of these key executives is party to an employment agreement which  subject to termination for cause or good reason  has a remaining term of seven months to years 
the loss of the services of mr 
peizer or any other key member of management could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business 
we are subject to personal injury claims  which could result in substantial liabilities that may exceed our insurance coverage all significant medical treatments and procedures  including treatment utilizing our protocols  involve the risk of serious injury or death 
even under proper medical supervision  withdrawal from alcohol may cause severe physical reactions 
while we have not been the subject of any such claims  our business entails an inherent risk of claims for personal injuries and substantial damage awards 
we cannot control whether individual physicians will apply the appropriate standard of care  or conform to our protocols in determining how to treat their patients 
while our agreements typically require physicians to indemnify us for their negligence  there can be no assurance they will be willing and financially able to do so if claims are made 
in addition  our license agreements require us to indemnify physicians  hospitals or their affiliates for losses resulting from our negligence 
we currently have insurance coverage for up to million per year for personal injury claims 
we may not be able to maintain adequate liability insurance at acceptable costs or on favorable terms 
we expect that liability insurance will be more difficult to obtain and that premiums will increase over time and as the volume of patients treated with our protocols increases 
in the event of litigation  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  we may sustain significant losses of our operating capital 
if government and third party payers fail to provide coverage and adequate payment rates for treatment using our protocols  our revenue and prospects for profitability will be harmed our future revenue growth will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement for treatment using our protocols from third party payers such as government health programs including medicare and medicaid  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs  and may not cover or provide adequate payment for treatment using our protocols 
adequate third party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to realize an appropriate return on investment in research and product development  and the lack of such reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
our international operations may be subject to foreign regulation  and the success of our foreign operations will depend on many factors the criteria of foreign laws  regulations and requirements are often vague and subject to change and interpretation 
our international operations may become the subject of foreign regulatory  civil  criminal or other investigations or proceedings  and our interpretations of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged 
the defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s time and attention  regardless of whether it ultimately is successful 
if we fail to comply with any applicable international laws  or a determination is made that we have failed to comply with these laws  our financial condition and results of operations  including our domestic operations  could be adversely affected 
in addition  the private pay healthcare system in europe is not as developed as in the u 
s and as a result it may be more difficult to convince patients in these countries to pay substantial amounts for treatment 
we will be reliant on relationships that we establish with local companies  thought leaders and governments 
there can be no 
table of contents assurance we will be able to establish these relationships  maintain them or that the partners will retain their influence in the market 
it may take longer than we expect to commence operations or to operate our business at profitable levels as we do not have the established relationships and or knowledge of the regulations and business practices in the markets we are entering 
we may not realize the expected benefits of the compcare acquisition  and may not be able to successfully utilize compcare s infrastructure we may not be successful in realizing the expected benefits of our license agreement with comprehensive care corporation or the recent acquisition of a majority controlling interest in compcare 
achieving the benefits of our relationship with compcare will depend in part on our ability to successfully utilize compcare s infrastructure and integrating with the benefits of its operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner 
the process will divert management time and attention from our other business  and require the effective coordination of personnel  systems  applications  policies  procedures  business processes and operations 
this  too  will be difficult  unpredictable  and subject to delay because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and business strategy 
we may be unable to retain compcare s key management  technical  sales and customer support personnel 
if we cannot successfully coordinate our operations and personnel  we will not realize the expected benefits of our relationship 
there may be ongoing legal challenges to our relationship with compcare  which could adversely affect our results of operations there is legal expense and potential delay  risk and uncertainty due to the ongoing litigation seeking to enjoin our proposed merger with compcare 
there are potential legal and economic risks associated with attempting to proceed with our proposed merger with compcare  as well as with terminating the merger agreement and continuing with our ongoing relationship as its majority controlling shareholder  including challenges from public minority shareholders concerning the procedural and financial fairness of our existing agreements  and any future agreements or arrangement between us 
current or future litigation may be expensive and time consuming  and may impede or restrict our ability to operate effectively  which could negative impact our results of operations 
risks related to compcare s business compcare may not be able to accurately predict utilization of its full risk contracts resulting in contracts priced at levels insufficient to ensure profitability managed care operations are at risk for costs incurred to provide agreed upon levels of service 
failure to anticipate or control costs could have material  adverse effects on compcare 
providing services on a full risk capitation basis exposes compcare to the additional risk that contracts negotiated and entered into may ultimately be unprofitable if utilization levels require it to provide services at capitation rates which do not account for or factor in such utilization levels 
failure to achieve anticipated cost reductions in populations brought under management would have an adverse effect on compcare s financial results 
compcare may be unsuccessful in managing its new indiana medicaid contract  or the contract may be significantly more costly than anticipated compcare may be unsuccessful in managing its new indiana medicaid contract that started january   which now comprises approximately one third of its operating revenues 
providing services under a new contract for populations at risk that have not been managed before exposes compcare to the risk it may be unprofitable 
there is a limited historical basis for the actuarial assumptions about the utilization of benefits by members covered under this new managed care behavioral program  and premiums based on these assumptions may be insufficient to cover the benefits provided and compcare may be unable to obtain offsetting rate increases 
contract premiums have been set based on anticipated significant savings and on types of utilization management that may not be possible  may cause disagreements with providers and divert management resources  which would have an adverse impact on compcare s financial results 

table of contents compcare s existing and potential managed care clients operate in a highly competitive environment and may be subject to a higher rate of merger  acquisition and regulation than in other industries compcare typically contracts with small to medium sized hmos which may be adversely affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means 
its clients may also determine to manage the behavioral healthcare benefits in house and  as a result  discontinue contracting with compcare 
additionally  its clients may be acquired by larger hmos  in which case there can be no assurance that the acquiring company would renew its contract 
many of compcare s managed care company clients provide services to groups covered by medicaid or children s health insurance program chip plans susceptible to annual changes in reimbursement rates and eligibility requirements that could ultimately affect compcare as of may   compcare managed approximately  lives in connection with behavioral and substance abuse services covered through eight chip and medicaid programs in texas and medicaid in florida and michigan 
of the  covered lives   are related to contracts terminating may  any changes in reimbursement could adversely affect compcare through contract bidding and cost structures with the health plans impacted by such changes 
temporary reductions have previously had a negative impact on compcare  and if implemented in the future could have a material  adverse impact on its operations 
other states may pass legislation that would reduce its revenue through changes in the reimbursement rates or in the number of eligible participants 
compcare may be unable to reduce its costs to a level that would allow it to maintain current gross margins specific to its medicaid and chip programs 
because providers are responsible for claims submission  the timing of which is uncertain  compcare must estimate the amount of claims incurred but not reported compcare s costs of care include estimated amounts for claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
the ibnr is estimated using an actuarial paid completion factor methodology and other statistical analyses that it continually reviews and adjusts  if necessary  to reflect any change in the estimated liability 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in utilization and other factors 
compcare s estimates of ibnr may be inadequate  which would negatively affect results of operations 
considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  its unpaid claims liability may be inadequate  and actual results may differ materially from the estimates reported 
as a result of compcare s dependence on a limited number of customers  the loss of any one of these customers  or a reduction in business from any one of them  could have a material  adverse effect on its working capital and future results of operations for the six months ended november   approximately of compcare s operating revenue was concentrated in contracts with six health plans to provide behavioral healthcare services under commercial  medicare  medicaid  and chip plans 
for the same period of the prior fiscal year  approximately of compcare s operating revenue was concentrated in contracts with eight health plans 
the terms of each contract is generally for one year and is automatically renewable for additional one year periods unless terminated by either party by giving the requisite written notice 
the loss of one or more of these clients  unless replaced by new business  would negatively affect the financial condition of compcare 
the industry is subject to extensive state and federal regulations  as well as diverse licensure requirements varying by state 
changes in regulations could affect the profitability of compcare s contracts or its ability to retain clients or to gain new customers compcare holds licenses or certificates to perform utilization review and third party administrator tpa services in some states 
additional utilization review or tpa licenses may be required in the future and compcare may not qualify to obtain them 
in many states  entities that assume risk under contract with licensed insurance companies or health plans have not been considered by state regulators to be conducting an insurance or hmo business 
as a result  compcare has not sought licensure as either an insurer or hmo in any state 
if the regulatory positions of these states were to change  its business could be materially affected until such time as it is able to meet the regulatory requirements  if at all 
additionally  some states may determine to contract directly with companies such as compcare for managed behavioral healthcare services in which case they may also require it to maintain financial reserves or net worth requirements that it may not be able to meet 
currently  compcare cannot quantify the potential effects of additional regulation of the managed care industry  but such costs will have an adverse effect on future operations to the extent that they are not able to be recouped in future managed care contracts 

table of contents compcare has an annual seasonality in the usage of its provider network  and its financial results may suffer to the extent it cannot adequately manage periods of increased utilization historically compcare has generally experienced increased utilization during its fourth fiscal quarter  which comprises the months of march  april and may  and lower utilization throughout the remainder of the year 
seasonal variation also impacts its costs of care during these months  generally having a negative impact on its gross margins and operating profits during the fourth quarter 
risks related to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect the proprietary treatment protocols which are the core of our business we consider the protection of our proprietary treatment protocols to be critical to our business prospects 
we obtained the rights to some of our most significant patent pending technologies through a license agreement which is subject to a number of conditions and restrictions  and a breach or termination of that agreement could significantly impact our ability to use and develop our technologies 
we currently have no issued us patents covering our prometa protocol for the treatment of alcohol dependency 
the applications we have licensed or filed may not issue as patents  and any issued patents may be too narrow in scope to provide us with a competitive advantage 
our patent position is uncertain and includes complex factual and legal issues  including the existence of prior art that may preclude or limit the scope of patent protection 
issued patents will generally expire twenty years after they were first filed 
examiners  competitors and others may institute challenges and if successful our patents may be denied  rendered unenforceable  or invalidated 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents  and to protect and prevent infringement can be substantial 
we may not be able to adequately protect the aspects of our treatment protocols that are not patented or have only limited patent protection 
furthermore  competitors and others may independently develop similar or more advanced treatment protocols and technologies  may design around aspects of our technology  or may discover or duplicate our trade secrets and proprietary methods 
to the extent we utilize processes and technology that constitute trade secrets under applicable laws  we must implement appropriate levels of security to ensure protection of such laws  which we may not do effectively 
policing compliance with our confidentiality agreements and unauthorized use of our technology is difficult 
in addition  the laws of many foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the united states 
while we have not had any significant issues to date  the loss of any of our trade secrets or proprietary rights which may be protected under the foregoing intellectual property safeguards may result in the loss of our competitive advantage over present and potential competitors 
confidentiality agreements with employees  licensees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes  we rely in part on confidentiality provisions in our agreements with employees  licensees  treating physicians and others 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
to date we have had three instances in which it was necessary to send a formal demand to cease and desist using our protocols to treat patients due to breach of confidentiality provisions in our agreements 
we may be subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others  and unfavorable outcomes could harm our business our future operations may be subject to claims  and potential litigation  arising from our alleged infringement of patents  trade secrets or copyrights owned by other third parties 
within the healthcare  drug and bio technology industry  established companies actively pursue infringement claims and litigation  which makes the entry of competitive products more difficult 
we may experience claims or litigation initiated by existing  better funded competitors 
court ordered injunctions may prevent us from bringing new products to market  and the 
table of contents outcome of litigation and any resulting loss of revenues and expenses of litigation may substantially affect our ability to meet our expenses and continue operations 
risks related to our industry our policies and procedures may not fully comply with complex and increasing regulation by state and federal authorities  which could negatively impact our business operations the healthcare industry is highly regulated and continues to undergo significant changes as third party payers  such as medicare and medicaid  traditional indemnity insurers  managed care organizations and other private payers increase efforts to control cost  utilization and delivery of healthcare services 
healthcare companies are subject to extensive and complex federal  state and local laws  regulations and judicial decisions 
in addition  the food and drug administration fda  regulates development  testing  labeling  manufacturing  marketing  promotion  distribution  record keeping and reporting requirements for prescription drugs  medical devices and biologics 
other regulatory requirements apply to dietary supplements  including vitamins 
compliance with laws and regulations enforced by regulatory agencies who have broad discretion in applying them may be required for our protocols or other medical products or services developed or used by us 
many healthcare laws and regulations applicable to our business are complex  applied broadly and subject to interpretation by courts and government agencies 
increasing regulation  political and legal action and pricing pressures could prevent us from marketing some or all of our products and services for a period of time or permanently 
our failure  or the failure of our licensees  to comply with applicable regulations may result in the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions that we cannot afford  or require redesign or withdrawal of our protocols from the market 
we may be subject to regulatory and investigative proceedings  which could adversely affect our financial condition or operations we may become the subject of regulatory or other investigations or proceedings  and our interpretations of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged 
the defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s time and attention 
thus  any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  regardless of whether it ultimately is successful 
if determination is made that we have failed to comply with any applicable laws  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the promotion of our protocols may be found to violate federal law concerning off label uses of prescription drugs  which could prevent us from marketing our protocols the food drug cosmetic fdc act  requires that prescription drugs be approved for a specific medical indication  and promotion of dietary supplements for uses beyond those permitted by law may be treated as the unlawful promotion of drugs 
violations of the fdc act may result in criminal or civil penalties  including seizure and injunction 
our protocols call for the use of prescription drugs for the treatment of chemical dependence and drug addiction  conditions not approved for use in the drugs official labeling  and the use of nutritional supplements 
the promotion of our protocols through advertising and other means may be found to violate fda regulations or the fdc act 
a successful enforcement action could prevent promotion of our protocols and we may be unable to continue operating under our current business model 
the expenses associated with losing or defending a claim  or negative publicity concerning the off label use of drugs in our protocols  could adversely affect our business and results of operation 
treatment using our protocols may be found to require review or approval  which could delay or prevent the study or use of our protocols the fda asserts jurisdiction over many clinical trials  or experiments in which a drug is administered to human subjects  and hospitals and clinics have established institutional review boards irbs to review and approve clinical trials using investigational treatments in their facilities 
use of our treatment protocol by individual physicians in treating their patients may be found to constitute a clinical trial or investigation that requires irb review or an fda investigational new drug ind exemption 
the fda may find that use of our protocols or collection of outcomes data constitutes a clinical investigation subject to irb and fda jurisdiction and may take enforcement action against us 
individual hospitals and physicians may also submit their use of our protocols in treatment to their irbs which may prohibit or place restrictions on it 
any of these results may adversely affect our business and the ability of our customers to use our protocols 

table of contents failure to comply with ftc laws or similar state laws could result in sanctions or limit the claims we can make our promotional activities and materials  including advertising to consumers and physicians  and materials provided to licensees for their use in promoting our protocols  are regulated by the federal trade commission ftc under the ftc act  which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices  including claims which are false  misleading or inadequately substantiated 
the ftc typically requires competent and reliable scientific tests or studies to substantiate express or implied claims that a product or service is effective 
if the ftc were to interpret our promotional materials as making express or implied claims that our protocols are effective for the treatment of alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine addiction  it may find that we do not have adequate substantiation for such claims 
failure to comply with the ftc act or similar laws enforced by state attorneys general and other state and local officials could result in administrative or judicial orders limiting or eliminating the claims we can make about our protocols  and other sanctions including substantial fines 
our business practices may be found to constitute illegal fee splitting or corporate practice of medicine  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business many states  including california in which our principal executive offices and two managed prometa centers are located  have laws that prohibit business corporations  such as us  from practicing medicine  exercising control over medical judgments or decisions of physicians  or engaging in arrangements such as employment or fee splitting  with physicians 
courts  regulatory authorities or other parties  including physicians  may assert that we are engaged in the unlawful corporate practice of medicine by providing administrative and ancillary services in connection with our protocols  or that licensing our technology for a license fee that could be characterized as a portion of the patient fees  or subleasing space and providing turn key business management to affiliated medical groups in exchange for management and licensing fees  constitute improper fee splitting  in which case we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties  our contracts could be found invalid and unenforceable  in whole or in part  or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements 
if so  we may be unable to restructure our contractual arrangements on favorable terms  which would adversely affect our business and operations 
our business practices may be found to violate anti kickback  self referral or false claims laws  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business the healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation with respect to financial relationships and kickbacks involving healthcare providers  physician self referral arrangements  filing of false claims and other fraud and abuse issues 
federal anti kickback laws and regulations prohibit offers  payments or receipts of remuneration in return for i referring patients covered by medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare programs  or ii purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for or recommending any service  good  item or facility for which payment may be made by a federal health care program 
in addition  federal physician self referral legislation  commonly known as the stark law  generally prohibits a physician from ordering certain services reimbursable by medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare programs from any entity with which the physician has a financial relationship  and many states have similar laws 
other federal and state laws govern the submission of claims for reimbursement  or false claims laws 
one of the most prominent of these laws is the federal false claims act  and violations of other laws  such as the anti kickback laws or the fda prohibitions against promotion of off label uses of drugs  may also be prosecuted as violations of the false claims act 
federal or state authorities may claim that our fee arrangements  agreements and relationships with contractors  hospitals and physicians violate these laws and regulations 
violations of these laws are punishable by monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties  exclusion from participation in government sponsored healthcare programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws 
if our business practices are found to violate any of these provisions  we may be unable to continue with our relationships or implement our business plans  which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to healthcare anti fraud initiatives  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business state and federal governments are devoting increased attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers  taking an expansive definition of fraud that includes receiving fees in connection with a healthcare business that is found to violate any of the complex regulations described above 
while to our knowledge we have not been the subject of any anti fraud investigations  if such a claim were made defending our business 
table of contents practices could be time consuming and expensive  and an adverse finding could result in substantial penalties or require us to restructure our operations  which we may not be able to do successfully 
our use and disclosure of patient information is subject to privacy and security regulations  which may result in increased costs in conducting research or providing administrative services to healthcare providers in connection with the use of our protocols  we may collect  use  maintain and transmit patient information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient identifiable health information  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of and its implementing regulations hipaa 
hipaa applies to covered entities  which include most healthcare facilities and health plans that will contract for the use of our protocols and our services 
the hipaa rules require covered entities to bind contractors like us to compliance with certain burdensome hipaa rule requirements 
other federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy of patient information also apply to our licensees directly and to us  either directly or indirectly 
we may be required to make costly system purchases and modifications to comply with the hipaa rule requirements that are imposed on us and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business 
compcare is subject to the administrative simplification requirements of hipaa for most healthcare facilities and health plans that contract for the use of compcare s services 
the hipaa transactions rule requires compcare to comply with format and data content standards for common healthcare transactions on behalf of our licensees 
the hipaa privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information  and requires safeguarding that information 
the hipaa security rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient information transmitted or stored electronically 
failure to comply may result in civil and criminal liability and penalties  and have a material adverse effect on compcare s ability to retain its customers or to gain new business 
federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the ftc and state attorneys general to regulate the collection  use and disclosure of personal or patient information  through web sites or otherwise  and to regulate the presentation of web site content 
courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the ftc  which concern consumer notice  choice  security and access 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of personal and patient information 
other countries also have  or are developing  laws governing the collection  use and transmission of personal or patient information and these laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business

table of contents difficult for investors to remove management of the company 
it could also deter unsolicited takeovers  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could discourage a change in control  and adversely affect existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company  even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue one or more series of preferred stock  which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock 
delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with interested stockholders 
these provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
these provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests
