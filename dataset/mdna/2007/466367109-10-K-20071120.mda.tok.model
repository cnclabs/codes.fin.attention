in addition  we recognize gains from the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees which are presented as a reduction of operating costs and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
the quick service restaurant industry is complex and challenging 
challenges presently facing the sector include higher levels of consumer expectations  intense competition with respect to market share  restaurant locations  labor  menu and product development  changes in the economy  including costs of commodities  and trends for healthier eating 
to address these challenges and others  management has developed a strategic plan focused on four key initiatives 
the first initiative is a growth strategy that includes opening new restaurants and increasing same store sales 
the second initiative is a holistic reinvention of the jack in the box brand through menu innovation  upgrading guest service and re imaging jack in the box restaurant facilities to reflect the personality of jack the chain s fictional founder and popular spokesman 
the third strategic initiative is to expand franchising through new restaurant development and the sales of company operated restaurants to franchisees to generate higher returns and higher margins  while mitigating business cost and investment risks 
the fourth initiative is to improve our business model as we transition to becoming a predominantly franchised restaurant chain 
the following summarizes the most significant events occurring in fiscal year increase in restaurant sales 
progress made in reinventing the jack in the box brand through menu upgrades  programs aimed at improving the guest experience through service initiatives and enhancements to the restaurant environment contributed to sales growth at jack in the box restaurants increasing both the average check and number of transactions 
this positive sales momentum resulted in increases in same store sales those restaurants open more than one year of at jack in the box company operated restaurants

credit facility 
in the first quarter  we entered into a new credit agreement consisting of a revolving credit facility of million with a five year maturity and a term loan facility of million with a six year maturity 
using our available cash resources  in the second quarter we prepaid without penalty million of our term loan which is expected to result in annualized interest savings of approximately million 
interest rate swaps 
to reduce exposure to rising interest rates  we converted million of our term loan at floating rates to a fixed interest rate for the next three years by entering into two interest rate swap contracts 
financial reporting changes at the beginning of fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas revised  share based payment r  which requires that all employee share based compensation be measured using a fair value method and that the resulting compensation cost be recognized in the financial 
table of contents statements 
in accordance with the modified prospective method of adoption  results for fiscal and prior periods were not restated 
refer to note  share based employee compensation  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
historical share and per share data in our annual report on form k has been restated to give retroactive recognition of our two for one stock split that was effected in the form of a stock dividend on october   with the exception of treasury share data as no stock dividend was paid with respect to treasury shares 
in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity  for all periods presented  the par value of the additional shares was reclassified from capital in excess of par value to common stock 
refer to note  stockholders equity  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the stock split 
effective fiscal  we are reporting gains as a discrete line item within operating costs and expenses  rather than within revenues  as previously presented 
prior year s gains on sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation 
this reclassification had no effect on previously reported earnings from operations  net earnings or shareholders equity 
effective september   we adopted the recognition and measurement provision of sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas requires companies to recognize the over or under funded status of their plans as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation and requires any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the adoption of sfas resulted in an after tax adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million related to a reclassification of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses from assets and liabilities to a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  as well as a requirement to recognize over and under funding of our pension and post retirement health plans

cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation fin which requires that we record a liability for an asset retirement obligation at the end of a lease if the amount can be reasonably estimated

net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share  in  million or per diluted share  in  and million  or per diluted share  in liquidity and capital resources general 
our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
our cash requirements consist principally of capital expenditures for new restaurant construction  restaurant renovations and upgrades of our management information systems  debt service requirements  working capital  income tax payments  and obligations related to our benefit plans 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure  working capital and debt service requirements 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at september  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily due to the use of cash to repurchase our common stock  and property and equipment expenditures  which were offset in part by borrowings under our new credit facility  cash flows provided by operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and from the sale of restaurants to franchisees 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or enhance existing restaurants  to repurchase shares of our common stock and to reduce debt

in the third quarter of  qdoba acquired nine franchise operated restaurants for approximately million in cash 
the primary assets acquired include million in net property and equipment and million in goodwill 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities increased million to million  compared with a year ago  due primarily to an increase in stock repurchases and term loan principal payments  offset in part by proceeds received related to our new credit facility 
new financing 
on december   we replaced our existing credit facility with a new credit facility intended to provide a more flexible capital structure and facilitate the execution of our strategic plan 
the new credit facility was comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on december  and ii a term loan maturing on december   initially both with london interbank offered rate libor plus 
at inception  we borrowed million under the term loan facility and used the proceeds to repay all borrowings under the prior credit facility  to pay related transaction fees and expenses and to repurchase a portion of our outstanding stock 
we subsequently elected to make  without penalty  a million optional prepayment of our term loan  which will be applied to the remaining scheduled principal installments in the direct order of maturity 
the prepayment reduced the interest rate on the credit facility by basis points to libor plus  which is expected to result in an annualized interest savings of approximately million 
at september   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility  million outstanding under the term loan and had letters of credit outstanding of million 
as part of the new credit agreement  we may also request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the new credit facility 
table of contents requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the new credit facility are secured by first priority liens and security interests in the capital stock  partnership  and membership interests owned by us and or our subsidiaries  and any proceeds thereof  subject to certain restrictions set forth in the credit agreement 
additionally  the credit agreement includes a negative pledge on all tangible and intangible assets including all real and personal property with customary exceptions 
loan origination costs associated with the new credit facility were million and are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the consolidated balance sheet as of september  deferred financing fees of million related to the prior credit facility were written off in the first quarter and are included in interest expense  net in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended september  interest rate swaps 
concurrent with the termination of our prior credit facility  we liquidated three swap agreements and reversed the fair value of the swaps recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  net 
we realized a net gain of million  included in interest expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended september  to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under our new credit facility  in march  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that will effectively convert million of our variable rate term loan borrowings to a fixed rate basis for three years 
debt covenants 
we are subject to a number of covenants under our various debt instruments  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  loans to franchisees  capital expenditures  lease commitments  stock repurchases and dividend payments  as well as requirements to maintain certain financial ratios  cash flows and net worth 
as of september   we complied with all debt covenants 
debt outstanding 
total debt outstanding increased to million at september  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
current maturities of long term debt decreased million and long term debt  net of current maturities increased million due to borrowings under the new credit facility 
at october   million was classified as current under the prior credit facility related to a clause in the agreement requiring prepayments based on an excess cash flow calculation 
repurchases of common stock 
on november   we announced the commencement of a tender offer for up to million shares of our common stock at a price per share not less than and not greater than  for a maximum aggregate purchase price of million 
on december   we accepted for purchase approximately million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  for a total cost of million 
on december   the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million shares in calendar year to complete the repurchase of the total shares authorized in the tender offer 
in the second quarter of  under a b plan  we repurchased million shares for million 
the tender offer and the additional repurchase program were funded through the new credit facility and available cash  and all shares repurchased were subsequently retired 
in september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of million of our outstanding common stock in the open market 
pursuant to this authorization  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in at a cost of million and  shares of common stock in at a cost of million 
the board of directors also approved a share repurchase program in fiscal year under this authorization  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in at a cost of million 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than operating leases  we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we finance a portion of our new restaurant development through sale leaseback transactions

includes expected payments associated with our defined benefit plans  postretirement benefit plans and our non qualified deferred compensation plan through fiscal consists primarily of letters of credit for workers compensation and general liability insurance 
discussion of critical accounting estimates we have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
retirement benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering those employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans  including assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels  as determined by us using specified guidelines 
in addition  our outside actuarial consultants also use certain statistical factors such as turnover  retirement and mortality rates to estimate our future benefit obligations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may affect the amount of pension expense we record 

table of contents self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our losses related to workers compensation  general liability  automotive  medical and dental programs 
in estimating our self insurance accruals  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analysis of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  accruals might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets  including amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
this review includes a restaurant level analysis that takes into consideration a restaurant s operating cash flows  the period of time since a restaurant has been opened or remodeled  and the maturity of the related market 
when indicators of impairment are present  we perform an impairment analysis on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the net carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss by the amount which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
goodwill and other intangibles we also evaluate goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
if the determined fair values of these assets are less than the related carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of september  allowances for doubtful accounts our trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due from franchisees for rents on subleased sites  royalties and distribution sales 
we continually monitor amounts due from franchisees and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses 
this estimate is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific franchisee accounts  as well as a general allowance based on historical trends  the financial condition of our franchisees  consideration of the general economy and the aging of such receivables 
we have good relationships with our franchisees and high collection rates  however  if the future financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make specific required payments  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts as we deem appropriate 
future application of accounting principles in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas clarifies the definition of fair value  describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value  and expands fair value disclosure requirements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that currently require or permit fair value measurements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently in the process of assessing the impact that sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
effective 
table of contents september   we implemented the recognition provisions of sfas sfas requires companies to recognize the over or under funded status of their plans as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation and requires any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
additionally  sfas no longer allows companies to measure their plans as of any date other than as of the end of their fiscal year 
however  this provision is not effective until fiscal years ending after december  we will not be able to determine the impact of adopting the measurement provision of sfas until the end of the fiscal year when such valuation is completed 
see note  retirement plans  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement plans and sfas in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently in the process of determining whether to elect the fair value measurement options available under this standard 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to risks relating to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
our credit facility  which is comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan  bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
as of september   the applicable margin for the libor based revolving loans and term loan was set at we use interest rate swap agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at september   we had two interest rate swap agreements having an aggregate notional amount of million expiring april  these agreements effectively convert a portion of our variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt and have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of including the term loan s applicable margin of 
a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  based on the outstanding unhedged balance of our revolving credit facility and term loan at september  would result in an estimated increase of million in annual interest expense 
changes in interest rates also impact our pension expense  as do changes in the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets 
an assumed discount rate is used in determining the present value of future cash outflows currently expected to be required to satisfy the pension benefit obligation when due 
additionally  an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is used in determining the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide the benefits to meet our projected benefit obligation 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our future annual pension expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
from time to time  we enter into futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
there were no open commodity futures and option contracts at september  at september   we had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure
