item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition  and the results of operations for willow financial bancorp  inc  and its subsidiary willow financial bank  for the fiscal years ended june   and the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere herein 
general net income is largely driven by net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities and the relative amount of our interest earning assets to interest earning liabilities 
non interest income and expenses  the provision for loan losses and income tax expense also affect the company s results of operations 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in management s opinion  the most critical accounting policies affecting the consolidated financial statements are evaluation of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgments and assumptions by management which may have a material impact on the carrying value of net loans and  potentially  on the amount of net income we recognize from period to period 
for a description of the methods the company uses to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see results of operations provision for loan losses 
realization of deferred income tax items 
included in other assets is a net deferred tax asset  which is an estimate of net deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which may have a material effect on the carrying value of this asset for financial reporting purposes 
for a more detailed description of these items and estimates  see note income taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements at and for the fiscal year ended june  goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of assets acquired over liabilities as a result of the merger and earlier branch acquisitions 
core deposit intangibles are a measure of the value of the checking  savings and money market deposits acquired in the merger accounted for under the purchase method 
the core deposit intangible is being amortized to expense over a twelve year life using a method that approximates a level yield method 
the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and performs impairment tests of the intangible assets as well as the review of the estimated life at least annually and impairment losses are recognized if the carrying value of the intangible exceeds its fair value 
the company has not recorded any impairment losses as a result of this analysis during fiscal years  and the notes to consolidated financial statements identify other significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of the financial statements 
this discussion and analysis  the significant accounting policies and other financial statement disclosures identify and address key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors that are necessary for an understanding and evaluation of the company and its results of operations

cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents  which consist of cash on hand and in other banks in interest earning and non interest earning accounts  amounted to million and million at june  and  respectively

securities available for sale 
at june   investment securities that were classified as available for sale afs totaled million  compared to million in afs securities at june  the decrease in available for sale securities was due to sales and repayments in the investment portfolio with the proceeds primarily being utilized to repay higher costing borrowings 
the unrealized loss  net of income taxes  on afs securities amounted to approximately million at june  compared to million at june  the increase in unrealized loss was the result of a rise in short term interest rates during the year 
securities held to maturity 
at june   investment securities classified as held to maturity totaled million  compared to million in held to maturity securities at june  held to maturity securities were comprised primarily of cmos and mortgage backed securities 
the decrease in held to maturity securities was the result of principal repayments experienced in the portfolio with the proceeds primarily being utilized to repay higher costing borrowings 
held to maturity investment securities are carried at amortized cost 
in order to more effectively manage its interest rate risk  the company plans limited additions to its htm portfolio 
loans 
the net loan portfolio  which does not include loans held for sale  decreased million or from billion at june  the decrease was primarily the result of increased repayment levels within the construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios  which decreased million and million  respectively  at june  compared to june  the commercial real estate loan decrease includes the sale of a non performing commercial real estate loan of million and the liquidation of million in real estate of a previous non performing loan 
in addition  single family residential loans decreased million at june  compared to june  as a part of management s strategy to reduce reliance on long term single family residential mortgage loans 
commercial business loans increased by million from june  to june  this increase occurred despite the charge off of a million commercial business borrowing relationship

additionally  the construction loan portfolio included larger residential projects  which sold at a more rapid pace than anticipated and the demand for new construction was not as robust as a result of a slowing in the housing market 
the company plans to focus its growth in commercial lending with a focus on small businesses  middle market commercial loans  commercial real estate lending  as well as consumer lending 
the allowance for loan losses decreased to million at june  compared to million at june   due primarily to charge offs recorded during the year 
the current fiscal year provision for loan losses decreased from fiscal by approximately million due largely to an million decrease in non performing loans 
during the current fiscal year  the company recorded net charge offs of million due largely to the charge off of two loan relationships which were categorized as non accrual at june  loans held for sale 
mortgage loans originated or purchased with the intention of being sold into the secondary market are classified as held for sale and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value with any unrealized loss reflected in the consolidated statements of income 
at june   million of fixed rate  single family residential mortgages were classified as held for sale compared to million in loans classified as held for sale at june  the increase of million resulted primarily from an increase in the bank s expansion of this business line as well as the timing of the origination of the loans and the ultimate delivery to the purchaser of the loans 
in order to mitigate the risk of loss on the sale of these loans  the company generally commits these loans for sale  on a best efforts basis  to a third party at the time that the borrower locks the loan with the company 
intangible assets 
at june   intangible assets aggregated million as compared to million at june  intangible assets include a core deposit intangible of million  which resulted from the acquisition of chester valley 
the core deposit intangible is being amortized using an accelerated method over a year life

the goodwill that resulted from the chester valley acquisition was approximately million 
as a result of the beneserv acquisition  goodwill of million and customer intangibles of million were recorded at june  the customer intangible balance is being amortized using a straight line method over a year life 
the remaining balance of the goodwill relates to a branch acquisition in approximated thousand at june  goodwill is measured for impairment at least annually 
the company has not recorded any impairment losses as a result of this analysis 
deposits 
during the year ended june   total deposits increased by million or 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase in money market demand deposit accounts as the company has been successful in migrating customer money market balances from its business segment  wis  as well as an increase in certificates of deposit resulting from customer preference for higher rate deposit accounts 
core deposits  which we define as savings  checking  now and money market accounts  increased by million as a result of the migration of wis deposits noted above 
checking accounts totaled million or of total deposits at june  compared to million  or of total deposits at june  the company will continue to deploy a strategy to increase core deposit accounts and balances through targeted marketing  cross selling of our existing customer base and expansion of our commercial business lending  which typically results in the opening of a checking account 
federal home loan bank advances 
advances from the fhlb provide the company with an additional source to fund interest earning asset growth and are a tool in meeting the company s asset liability strategies 
at june   the total amount of these borrowings was million  a decrease of million or from the million outstanding at june  this decrease was the direct result of repayments as the excess cash generated from the deposit growth  investment securities sales and repayments  and loan repayments was utilized to repay certain fhlb advances 
trust preferred securities 
effective with the acquisition of chester valley  the company assumed the liability for million of junior subordinated debentures to the chester valley statutory trust  a pennsylvania business trust  in which the company owned all of the common equity as a result of the acquisition of chester valley 
the trust issued million of trust preferred securities to investors  which were secured by the junior subordinated debentures and the guarantee of the company 
these trust preferred securities were redeemed by the company on march  in accordance with the trust agreement 
on march   the company issued million of junior subordinated debentures to willow financial statutory trust i  a connecticut statutory trust  in which the company owns all of the common equity 
the trust then issued million of trust preferred securities  which pay interest quarterly at three month libor plus to investors  which are secured by the junior subordinated debentures and the guarantee of the company 
the junior subordinated debentures are treated as debt of the company but qualify as tier i capital of the bank to the extent of the amount of the proceeds which are invested in the bank 
the trust preferred securities are callable by the company on or after september  the trust preferred securities must be redeemed by the company upon their maturity in the year accounting for derivative instruments and hedging 
the company may from time to time utilize derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate collars  interest rate floors  interest rate swaptions or combinations thereof to assist in its asset liability management 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments  the company documents its hedge relationships  including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge 
the company also assesses  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
for fair value hedges  both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative  along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in the statement of operations within interest income or interest expense 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
when the hedged item impacts the statement of operations  the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is reported on the same line in the statement of operations as the hedged item 
in addition  the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges is reported in the statement of operations 
as part of the merger  the company assumed the responsibility for a million notional interest rate swap whereby the company paid a variable rate and received a fixed rate 
the interest rate swap had been used to hedge certain fhlb borrowings of the former chester valley 
on the date of the merger  the interest rate swap and the hedged borrowings were marked to fair value as a result of purchase accounting 
in september  the hedged borrowings were repaid and the million notional amount of the interest rate swap was unwound with the counter party 
after performing the appropriate documentation of the derivative instrument  the company designated the remaining million notional amount interest rate swap as a fair value hedge of certain existing borrowings of willow financial bank 
the swap had the effect of converting a fixed rate borrowing to an adjustable rate borrowing 
during the quarter ended december   the derivative instrument ceased to be a highly effective hedge  therefore  the company discontinued hedge accounting resulting in a pre tax charge to income of thousand 
the interest rate swap was unwound in february without 
any additional impact to operations 
the basis adjustment that was previously recorded on the hedged borrowing that is recorded in the statement of financial condition is amortized as an increase in interest expense over the remaining life of the borrowing using the interest method 
additionally  in august  chester valley purchased a million notional amount six month libor interest rate cap while simultaneously selling a million notional amount six month libor interest rate cap interest rate corridor which expires in august chester valley paid a net premium  which entitled it to receive the difference between six month libor from up to applied to the million notional amount 
upon consummation of the merger  the company assumed the interest rate corridor and designated it to hedge certain borrowings of willow financial bank  which were variable in nature and indexed to six month libor 
the interest rate corridor was being used to hedge the cash flows of this borrowing 
prior to october   the interest rate corridor reduced the negative impact on earnings of the borrowings in a rising interest rate environment 
the fair market value of the interest rate corridor had two components the intrinsic value and the time value of the option 
the interest rate corridor was marked to market quarterly  with changes in the intrinsic value of the interest rate corridor  net of tax  included as a separate component of other comprehensive income  and the change in the time value of the option included directly as interest expense as required under sfas in addition  the ineffective portion  if any  would have been expensed in the period in which ineffectiveness was determined 
on october   the company unwound the interest rate corridor and recognized a gain of thousand upon repayment of the million fhlb advance 
at june   the company had five interest rate swap arrangements used to hedge specific loans originated by the bank for which the transactions were economically beneficial to the bank in passing along the interest rate risk to the borrower 
the swaps effectively convert the rates from a floating rate based on libor to a fixed rate throughout the life of the underlying loans 
at june   the total outstanding notional amount on these swaps was million 
the weighted average floating and fixed rates on these transactions were and  respectively at june  the company lacked sufficient documentation for these transactions to receive hedge accounting treatment 
as such  the bank has recorded a net receivable of thousand in other assets on the statements of financial condition at june  the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps is included as a component of other income on the consolidated statements of income 
stockholders equity 
at june   total stockholders equity amounted to million or of total assets compared to million  or of assets at june  during the year  the company paid aggregate cash dividends of million

loans receivable include non accrual loans 
to adjust nontaxable loans and securities to a taxable equivalent  a  and effective rate has been used for the fiscal years ending june    and  respectively 
the adjustment of tax exempt loans and securities to a tax equivalent yield in the table below may be considered to include non gaap financial information 
management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin  net interest rate spread and net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis 
therefore  management believes  these measures provide useful information to investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons

net income for the year ended june  was million  a decrease of million or 
the decrease resulted primarily from an increase in non interest expense of million  partially offset by an increase in non interest income of million and a decrease in income tax expense of million 
net income for the year ended june  was million  an increase of million or from the year ended june  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in net interest income of million and an increase in non interest income of million 
each of these were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses of million  an increase in operating expenses of million or and an increase in income tax expense of million 
the improvement was largely driven by the merger  which was effective after the close of business on august  net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million or to million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the year ended june  this decrease was due primarily to an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  while the yield on average earning assets increased by only basis points 
one factor that influences net interest income is the interest rate spread ie  the difference between the average yields on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the average interest rate spread computed on a fully tax equivalent basis for the years ended june   and was  and  respectively 
the net interest margin ie  net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets was  and for the same three respective fiscal years 
net interest income increased by million or to million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the year ended june  the significant improvement largely resulted from the merger and the balance sheet de leveraging strategy deployed by the company 
chester valley s balance sheet was asset sensitive assets reprice quicker than liabilities during a year in which the federal reserve aggressively raised short term rates 
additionally  the company received the full benefit of the additional earning assets from the acquisition for ten months 
the balance sheet de leveraging allowed the company to sell lower yielding investment securities while repaying higher costing borrowings 
interest income 
interest income includes the interest earned on loans and investment securities  as well as yield adjustments for the premiums  discounts and deferred fees or costs recorded in connection with the acquisition of these assets 
total interest income for the year ended june  was million compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was million or due primarily to an increase in the average balance of outstanding loans of million 
additionally  the yield on loans increased approximately four basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in the average yield of the loan portfolio was largely the result of a change in the mix of the loan portfolio reflecting the company s reduced reliance on long term single family residential mortgage loans and increase in home equity loans and lines of credit  along with the interest rate sensitive assets acquired from chester valley at a time in which the federal reserve was aggressively raising short term interest rates 
also contributing to the increase was an approximate basis point increase in the average yield in the investment securities portfolio  partially offset by a decrease of million in the average balance of investment securities 
the increase in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was million or due primarily to an increase in the average balance of outstanding loans of million as a result of the merger 
additionally  the yield on loans increased approximately basis points  as chester valley s loans were re pricing at a time when the federal reserve aggressively increased short term rates 
also contributing to the increase was an approximate basis point increase in the average yield in the investment portfolio as the company completed a de leveraging strategy by liquidating approximately million of investment securities with an average yield of 
the above factors were partially offset by reduced levels in the average balance of investment securities 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of the interest paid to depositors on their interest bearing deposit accounts as well as interest paid on borrowings 
for the fiscal year ended june   total interest expense was million compared to million and million  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended june   interest expense increased by million  or compared to the fiscal year ended june  this increase was due primarily to a million  or  increase in interest expense on deposits  which was partially offset by a million  or decrease in interest expense on borrowings 
this increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to the increase in average deposits of million  or 
in addition  the average cost of deposits increased by basis points in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was partially offset by a reduction of million or in average borrowings for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june   interest expense increased by million  or compared to the fiscal year ended june  this increase was due primarily to an increase in average interest bearing liabilities resulting from the merger 
average deposit and borrowings balances increased million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal additionally  the company s cost of funds increased approximately basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal  as the federal reserve aggressively raised short term rates coupled with the competition for deposits in the bank s market area  which led the bank to raise its interest rate paid on money market balances and certificates of deposits 
additionally  the trust preferred security assumed in the merger was a floating rate borrowing  for which the rate increased throughout the year 
provision for loan losses 
in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that management deems adequate to absorb known and unknown losses which are both probable and can be reasonably estimated  a provision for loan losses is recorded through charges to earnings 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon the company s regular review of credit quality and is based upon  but not limited to  the following factors an evaluation of our loan portfolio  loss experience  current economic conditions  volume  growth  composition of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses is an estimate and actual losses may vary from these estimates 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly and makes any necessary adjustments to maintain the allowance for losses at a level deemed adequate 
for the years ended june   and  the provisions for loan losses were thousand  million  and million  respectively 
the decreased amount of the provision in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the decrease in non performing assets of million  which were partially offset by net charge offs of million 
the increased provision in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the increase in non performing assets of million 
at june   the balance in the allowance for loan losses was million compared to million at june   with the decrease resulting from million in net charge offs during fiscal the percentage of the allowance for losses to loans  net of deferred fees  decreased to at june  compared to at june  management believes the allowance for loan loss was adequate at june  and represents all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable 
no assurance can be given as to the amount or timing of additional provisions for loan losses in the future as a result of potential increases in the amount of the company s non performing loans in the remainder of the company s loan portfolio 
regulatory agencies  in the course of their regular examinations  review the allowance for losses and carrying value of non performing assets 
no assurance can be given that these agencies might not require changes to the allowance for losses in the future 
non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of investment services income  account service fees and charges  loan servicing fees  realized gains and losses on assets available or held for sale  increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli and with the acquisition of beneserv  insurance premiums 
total non interest income for the years ended june    and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in non interest income of million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million difference in the amount of gain loss recognized on the sale of securities available for sale  a gain of thousand recorded during the quarter ended december  on the unwinding of an interest rate corridor  increased investment services income of thousand  thousand for income from the insurance operations of beneserv  increased service charges and fees of thousand  and thousand in gains on the sale of real estate owned 
the increase in service charges and fees was due primarily to growth in the deposit base 
the increase in investment services income was the result of growth in the trust operations and the sales of retail investment products through the branch network 
the increase in non interest income of million during fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to investment services income of million received from the acquisition of wis and chester valley s trust division in the merger 
these were two new lines of business for the company 
service charges and fees increased by million or in fiscal due primarily to increased deposit fees associated with the growth in checking accounts from the merger as well as increases in the overdraft protection fees for which chester valley was further along in implementation and thus had a higher volume of users 
gains on loans available for sale declined thousand due primarily to lower loan volumes resulting from the rising interest rate environment 
this was largely offset by an increase in other income of thousand  which resulted primarily from income on the boli acquired from chester valley 
as noted previously  the company implemented a de leveraging strategy in which it incurred approximately thousand in losses in the sale of investment securities 
non interest expense 
the primary components of non interest expense are compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing costs  deposit account services  professional fees and a variety of other expenses 
for the years ended june    and  non interest expense totaled million  million and million  respectively 
non interest expense increased million  or from the year ended june  to the comparable period ended june  salaries and employee benefit expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended june    and for the year ended june   compensation costs increased by million partially as a result of operating our expanded branch office network for a full months after the acquisition of chester valley on august  as well as new hirings in the lending and wealth management areas during the year ended june  along with normal salary increases 
at june   the company had full time employees compared to at june  in addition  thousand of compensation costs were recorded during fiscal due to severance payments and costs associated with the retirement of three board members as well as certain employee reductions 
for the year ended june   compensation and benefit costs increased approximately million or due primarily to an increased number of employees as a result of the merger 
occupancy and equipment expenses were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
during fiscal year  occupancy costs increased partially as a result of operating our expanded branch office network for full months after the acquisition of chester valley and also due to additional rental costs incurred at the corporate headquarters building and rental expense associated with certain bank buildings sold in a sale leaseback transaction 
during fiscal year  these costs increased million due to the addition of branch locations from the merger as well as the company s relocation to a new corporate headquarters and operations building in february in fiscal  the approximate occupancy cost of thousand for the headquarters building was offset by a sale leaseback of certain of the bank s branches for which the cash proceeds were invested in loans or repaid borrowings 
the company s rent expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and is expected to remain relatively stable at million in fiscal based on current leases 
advertising expenses for fiscal  and were million  million and thousand  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year was a result of the bank s re branding efforts during the year associated with the change in the bank s name 
the increase during fiscal was due primarily to direct mail campaigns to the combined company s customer base as the company commissioned a study of its customer base and found there were significant opportunities to cross sell its existing products 
for the fiscal years ended june    and  amortization of intangible assets was million  million and thousand respectively 
the significant increase in fiscal was the result of the amortization of the core deposit intangible recorded as a result of the merger 
the asset is being amortized using an accelerated method over a twelve year period 
amortization of intangible assets is expected to be million for the fiscal year ending june  data processing expenses were million  million  and thousand  respectively  for fiscal  and the increase in each year resulted from increased accounts and a rate increase in the company s third party data processing contract 
professional fees were million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  professional fees were relatively stable as compared to fiscal the increase in the fiscal resulted primarily from increased consulting costs related to the integration of the sarbanes oxley compliance for the combined company  an analysis of our customer base  and assistance with the development of the combined company s strategic plan and branding initiatives 
for the fiscal years ended june    and  other expenses  which include miscellaneous operating items  were million  million and million  respectively 
income tax provision 
income tax expense amounted to million for the year ended june  this compares to a tax expense of million  and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for fiscal  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the income tax expense and the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was primarily related to an overall decline in income before income taxes resulting in a lower statutory rate  as well as an increase in the balance of tax exempt securities and related income 
liquidity and commitments the company s primary sources of funds are from deposits  principal amortization of loans  loan and securities prepayments and repayments  interest income from loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
we have also utilized outside borrowings  primarily from the fhlb of pittsburgh as an additional funding source 
we use our liquidity resources to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses 
at june   outstanding approved loan commitments were million and certificates of deposit maturing within the next twelve months amounted million 
based upon historical experience  it is anticipated that a significant portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be reinvested in the bank 
however  the bank may not aggressively try to retain funds from maturing certificates of deposits if it is a single relationship customer driven by higher rates 
during the current fiscal year  the company utilized principal repayments on investment securities and loans to reduce its use of borrowings from the fhlb 
outstanding borrowings from the fhlb have decreased to million at june  as compared to million at june  under terms of the borrowing agreement with the fhlb  the bank pledges certain assets such as residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities as well as stock in the fhlb as collateral for these advances 
at june   the bank had million in additional borrowing capacity available from the fhlb 
prior to the merger  the company had not in the past used any significant off balance sheet financing arrangement for liquidity or other purposes 
our financial assets with off balance sheet risk are limited to obligations to fund loans to borrowers pursuant to existing loan commitments 
additionally  the company has not had any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could affect its liquidity or capital resources  nor do we currently intend to engage in trading commodity contracts 
with the merger and the resulting increased size of the combined companies  the company may  from time to time  utilize certain derivative financial instruments to assist in its asset liability strategies and has in fact assumed the liability for certain interest rate derivatives entered into by chester valley 
the company fully anticipates that it will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet its current commitments 
the company s contractual obligations as of june  are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands federal home loan debt operating leases total obligations total less than year years years more than years lines of credit standby letters of credit other commitments to make loans construction loans total impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements  accompanying notes  and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  therefore  the impact of interest rates has a greater impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk asset liability management and interest rate risk the market value of assets and liabilities  as well as future earnings  can be affected by interest rate risk 
market values of certain financial assets have an inverse relationship to rates  ie  when interest rates rise  the market value of many of the company s assets decline and when rates fall  the market value of many of the company s assets rise 
the primary assets of the company are loans to borrowers who often have the ability to prepay their loan 
therefore  in a falling rate environment  the increase in the market value of the company s assets is limited by this option for the borrower to prepay the loan 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest spread that can be maintained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity gap gap is a measure of the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that either mature or re price within a specified time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities  and is considered negative when interest bearing liabilities exceed interest earning assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would generally result in an increase in net interest income  and a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income 
this is usually the case  however  interest rates on differing financial instruments will not always change at the same time or to the same extent 
the following gap table shows the amount as of june  of the bank s assets and liabilities projected to mature or re price within various time periods

the company has adopted asset liability management policies designed to quantify the interest rate risk caused by mismatches in the maturities and re pricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these interest rate risk and asset liability management actions are taken under the guidance of the finance committee 
the finance committee s purpose is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the objective of the finance committee is to manage asset and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the finance committee meets at least quarterly and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account the relative costs and spreads  the interest rate sensitivity gap and liquidity needs 
the finance committee also reviews economic conditions and interest rate projections  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions  anticipated changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  and interest rate exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to gap analysis and interest income simulations 
at each meeting  the finance committee recommends changes in strategy as appropriate 
interest rate risk issues are also discussed by the board of directors on a regular basis 
management meets periodically to monitor progress in achieving asset liability targets approved by the board  particularly the type and rate on asset generation and sources of funding 
in order to manage the company s assets and liabilities and improve our interest rate risk position  emphasis has been placed on the origination of assets with shorter maturities or adjustable rates such as commercial and multi family real estate loans  construction loans  home equity loans and to a lesser extent commercial business loans 
at the same time  other actions include attempts to increase our core deposits and the use of fhlb advances as additional sources of funds 
additionally  longer term fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans are originated and held for sale 
the finance committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by  among other things  examining the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and net portfolio value npv  and the change in npv 
npv is the difference between the market value of assets and the market value of liabilities and off balance sheet items under various interest rate scenarios 
sensitivity is the difference measured in basis points between the npv to assets ratio at market rate and the npv to assets ratio determined under each rate scenario 
the finance committee monitors both the npv and sensitivity according to guidelines established by the ots in thrift bulletin a management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivative activities  and board approved limitations 
presented below  as of june  and  is an analysis of the interest rate risk position as measured by npv and sensitivity based upon various rate scenarios 
these values were obtained from an internal model produced by the bank as required by ots regulation as total assets now exceed billion 
due to the level of interest rates  no values are calculated for hypothetical rate scenarios of down basis points at june  it only provides an estimate of economic value at a point in time and the economic value of the same portfolio under the above referenced interest rate scenarios 
estimated change in npv and sensitivity at june  net portfolio value amount of change percent of change to assets in thousands hypothetical change in interest rates up basis points up basis points up basis points no change base case down basis points down basis points estimated change in npv and sensitivity at june  net portfolio value amount of change percent of change to assets in thousands hypothetical change in interest rates up basis points up basis points up basis points no change base case down basis points down basis points down basis points the bank s sensitivity remained relatively stable for fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to interest sensitive assets acquired in the merger  which was partially offset  by the intangible assets recorded with the acquisition 
npv is more sensitive and may be more negatively impacted by rising interest rates than by declining rates 
this occurs primarily because as rates rise  the market value of long term fixed rate assets  like fixed rate mortgage loans  declines due to both the rate increase and slowing prepayments 
when rates decline  these assets do not experience similar appreciation in value 
this is due to the decrease in the duration of the asset resulting from the increase in prepayments
