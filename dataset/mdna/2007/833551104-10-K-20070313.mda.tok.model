item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an assessment of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management s determination of estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities requires the exercise of judgment in the selection and application of assumptions based on various factors  including historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we routinely evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer returns and promotions  provisions for bad debts  inventory valuations  useful lives of fixed assets  hedge transactions  supplemental retirement benefits  intangible asset valuations  incentive compensation  income taxes  self insurance  post retirement benefits  contingencies and legal proceedings 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
executive summary fiscal represented a year of foundation building for our company 
our efforts focused on integrating the tom s business  building and reorganizing our management team  and developing and executing our plan for growth and operational efficiency 
one of our most significant initiatives during was the integration of the tom s acquisition into our operations 
integration of the acquisition consumed a significant amount of focus and resources throughout the company and had a negative impact on our financial results for the year 
during  we successfully consolidated tom s products and customers into our dsd system  secured relationships with independent distributors outside of our dsd geography  rationalized product offerings  closed the knoxville manufacturing operation and consolidated production at our other manufacturing facilities  established a cost effective distribution footprint that is closer to our customers by installing kettle chip capacity in our florida and texas facilities and bringing production of previously outsourced don pablo s brand tortilla chips into existing facilities  integrated the new facilities onto our existing computer systems  and eliminated redundant functions within the combined entity 
the integration phase of the tom s acquisition was largely completed in however  we will continue to focus on realizing the full benefits of the tom s acquisition  which will require additional refinements in our product offerings  pricing strategy and capacity utilization in during  management began the process of developing the strategic plan which will provide the foundation for future growth 
one of our key priorities is to improve our infrastructure to enable us to efficiently  effectively and profitably grow our company 
these improvements include organizational alignment  supply chain efficiencies  improved information technology systems  and enhanced dsd operations 
the foundation of our strategic plan is our people and how they influence the changes needed in our organization 
during  we strengthened our management team and attracted new members of management that will drive positive changes necessary for the future 
we realigned our organizations to support our focus on the total business and improve communication  teamwork and execution 
we also changed our employee compensation structure to be more in line with the market in order to attract and retain key employees 
supply chain leverage is critical to efficient operations 
the changes that were made during included centralizing procurement  logistics and manufacturing  opening remote distribution centers and improving the distribution fleet by investing in higher capacity trailers 
in addition  we focused on implementing best practices at all locations 
by consolidating our supply chain  we can take advantage of our manufacturing and logistics resources based on customer needs and locations 
in addition  by centralizing procurement we will be able to capitalize on volume pricing 
during  we spent over million to improve manufacturing and logistic efficiencies to support the consolidated supply chain 
an integrated information technology system is vital to support future growth of the organization by providing necessary information for decision making 
in addition  a standardized system will promote consistent and improved practices and processes 
we spent approximately million on information and handheld computer technology expenditures in the handheld computer project is expected to be completed by the second quarter of  while the common integrated information system project will continue through our dsd system has been a focus of our organization over an extended period of time and much improvement has been made to increase the average drop size per customer and route profitability 
however  our route fleet was considerably aged and our handheld computers were not up to date technologically 
in  we increased our capital spending to improve our route fleet by purchasing new trucks for million and began the roll out of new handheld computers as discussed above 
based on our business strengths and plans for the future  we decided late in to discontinue our vending business and focus our attention on more profitable areas of our business 
accordingly  our vending operations are included in discontinued operations  and we recognized related earnings per diluted share of less than on revenue of million in revenue from continuing operations in increased as compared to branded revenue increased and non branded revenue increased 
the increase in revenue was favorably impacted by the tom s acquisition as well as continued growth in lance and cape cod potato chips branded products  but was negatively impacted by declining revenue from a major private label customer and the shorter week year in compared to a week year in net income from continuing operations in increased million as compared to the change in net income from continuing operations included million in for pre tax expenses related to the integration of the tom s facilities as compared to million in as well as million of executive severance charges expensed in excluding these charges  net income would have decreased million compared to prior year 
commodity and packaging rates increased million in compared to  primarily due to the increased cost of flour and sugar 
fuel and natural gas prices increased million  and the impact of foreign currency negatively impacted pre tax earnings million 
in addition  in we adopted statement of financial accounting sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas r  which increased pre tax stock based compensation expense million as compared to fiscal offsetting these increases in expenses in were reductions in expenses for casualty losses and bad debts of million and million  respectively as compared to during  we entered into a new debt agreement that provides for revolving credit of up to us million and cdn million  and a us million term loan 
as of december   we had million outstanding in debt and million in cash and cash equivalents 
critical accounting policies we believe the following to be critical accounting policies 
that is  they are both important to the financial condition and results of operations and require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition our policy on revenue recognition varies based on the types of products sold and the distribution method 
we recognize operating revenue when title and risk of loss passes to our customers 
allowances for sales returns  stale products  promotions and discounts are also recorded as reductions of revenue in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue for products sold through our dsd system is recognized when the product is delivered to the retailer 
our sales representative creates the invoice at time of delivery using a handheld computer 
the invoice is transmitted electronically each day and sales revenue is recognized 
customers purchasing products through the dsd system have the right to return product if it is not sold by the expiration date on the product label 
we have recorded an estimated allowance for product that may be returned as a reduction to revenue 
we estimate the number of days until product is sold through the customer s location and the percent of sales returns using historical information 
this information is reviewed on a quarterly basis for significant changes and updated no less than annually 
revenue for products shipped directly to the customer from our warehouse is recognized based on the shipping terms listed on the shipping documentation 
products shipped with terms fob shipping point are recognized as revenue at the time the shipment leaves our warehouses 
products shipped with terms fob destination are recognized as revenue based on the anticipated receipt date by the customer 
we sell products through our company owned vending machines using two methods 
the first method is the wholesale method  with the customer managing the vending machine and purchasing products from us 
under this method  revenue is recognized when product is delivered 
the second method is the full service method  with our sales representatives managing the vending machines and commissions being paid to each customer based on sales 
revenue is recognized under this method when inventory is restocked and cash is collected from the machine and is recorded net of commissions and sales tax 
revenues using both methods are included in discontinued operations 
we record certain reductions to revenue for promotional allowances 
there are several different types of promotional allowances such as off invoice allowances  rebates and shelf space allowances 
an off invoice allowance is a reduction of the sales price that is directly deducted from the invoice amount 
we record the amount of the deduction as a reduction to revenue when the transaction occurs 
rebates are offered to customers based on the quantity of product purchased over a period of time 
based on the nature of these allowances  the exact amount of the rebate is not known at the time the product is sold to the customer 
an estimate of the expected rebate amount is recorded as a reduction to revenue and an accrued liability at the time the sale is recorded 
the accrued liability is monitored throughout the time period covered by the promotion 
the accrual is based on historical information and the progress of the customer against the target amount 
shelf space allowances are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the agreement or three years and recorded as a reduction to revenue 
capitalized shelf space allowances are evaluated for impairment on an ongoing basis 
we also record certain allowances for coupon redemptions  scan back promotions and other promotional activities as a reduction to revenue 
the accrued liability is monitored throughout the time period covered by the coupon or promotion 
insurance reserves we maintain reserves for the self funded portions of employee medical insurance and for post retirement healthcare benefits 
in addition  we maintain insurance reserves for the self funded portions of workers compensation  auto  product and general liability insurance 
self insured accruals are based on claims filed and estimated claims incurred but not reported 
workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs are covered by standby letters of credit with our claims administrators 
for casualty insurance obligations  we maintain self insurance reserves for workers compensation and auto liability for individual losses up to million 
in addition  general and product liability claims are self funded for individual losses up to million 
we use a third party actuary to assist in the estimation of the casualty insurance obligation on an annual basis 
in determining the ultimate loss and reserve requirements  the third party actuary uses various actuarial assumptions including compensation trends  healthcare cost trends and discount rates 
the third party actuary also uses historical information for claims frequency and severity in order to establish loss development factors 
the actuarial calculation determines an estimated range of loss reserves 
consistent with prior periods  the th percentile of this range represents our best estimate of the ultimate outstanding casualty liability 
during and  we used a investment rate to discount the estimated claims based on the historical payout pattern 
we have a post retirement healthcare plan which currently provides medical insurance benefits for retirees and their spouses to age the plan was amended in  and we began to phase out the post retirement healthcare plan 
the post retirement healthcare plan will be phased out over the next five years 
we use a third party actuary to assist in the estimation of the post retirement healthcare plan obligation on an annual basis 
this obligation requires assumptions regarding participation  healthcare cost trends  employee contributions  turnover  mortality and discount rates 
claims in excess of the self insured levels  which vary by type of insurance  are fully insured up to million per individual claim 
actual losses could vary from those estimated by the third party actuary 
we believe the reserves established are reasonable estimates of the ultimate liability based on historical trends 
accounts receivable we record accounts receivable at the time revenue is recognized 
amounts for bad debt expense are recorded in selling  marketing and delivery expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimate of uncollectible accounts receivables 
we record a general reserve based on analysis of historical data 
in addition  management records specific reserves for receivable balances that are considered at higher risk due to known facts regarding the customer 
we have a formal policy for determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the assumptions for this determination are reviewed quarterly to ensure that business conditions or other circumstances are consistent with the assumptions 
failure of a major customer to pay amounts owed to us could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
bad debt expense benefit for the fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the bad debt benefit in resulted from unanticipated collections of accounts receivable previously reserved for or written off 
at december  and december   we had accounts receivable of million and million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily due to write offs of uncollectible accounts that were either part of the opening balance sheet of the tom s acquisition or previously expensed in the following table summarizes our customer accounts receivable profile as of december  accounts receivable balance of customers less than  greater than  goodwill and other intangible assets the annual impairment analysis of goodwill requires us to project future financial performance  including revenue and profit growth  fixed asset and working capital investments  income tax rates and cost of capital 
these projections rely upon historical performance  anticipated market conditions and forward looking business plans 
the analysis of goodwill as of december  assumes combined average annual revenue growth of approximately during the valuation period 
significant investments in fixed assets and working capital to support this growth are factored into the analysis 
if the forecasted revenue growth is not achieved  the required investments in fixed assets and working capital could be reduced 
even with the excess fair value over carrying value  changes in assumptions or changes in conditions could result in a goodwill impairment charge in the future 
amortizable intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives  which is the estimated period over which economic benefits are expected to be provided 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are tested for impairment on an annual basis 
depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at historical cost  and depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the lives of the assets 
the lives used in computing depreciation are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will provide economic benefits 
such lives may be the same as the physical lives of the assets  but they can be shorter or longer 
estimated lives are based on historical experience  maintenance practices  technological changes and future business plans 
our policies require the periodic review of remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization 
property  plant and equipment are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if this comparison indicates that an asset s carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized  and the adjusted carrying amount is depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life 
assets that are to be disposed of by sale are recognized in the financial statements at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  and are not depreciated once they are classified as held for sale 
in order for an asset to be classified as held for sale  the asset must be actively marketed  available for immediate sale and meet certain other specified criteria 
new accounting standards we adopted sfas r at the beginning of sfas r establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  such as when an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the revised statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
changes in fair value during the required service period are to be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
in addition  sfas r amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
when we adopted sfas r  we elected the modified prospective application method and prior period amounts have not been restated 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r for the year ended december  was a decrease in pre tax income of million 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin is expected not to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the fasb also issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  in september sfas no 
requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a single employer defined benefit post retirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
sfas no 
also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet  with limited exceptions 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
that are effective at the end of the fiscal year ending after december   which resulted in a reclassification of the unrealized gain component of the accrued post retirement healthcare costs liability to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  at december  the year end measurement requirement will be effective for fiscal years ending after december  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
the fasb issued sfas no 
to mitigate earnings volatility that arises when financial assets and liabilities are measured differently  and to expand the use of fair value measurement for financial instruments 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  results of operations favorable compared to in millions unfavorable revenue cost of sales gross margin selling  marketing and delivery expenses general and administrative expenses other expense income  net earnings before interest and taxes interest expense  net income tax expense net income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations income tax expense net income from discontinued operations net income revenue from continuing operations for the fifty two weeks ended december  increased million or compared to the fifty three week period ended december  the additional week in from continuing operations generated million in revenue

we use the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  forecasts  may  will  should  and similar expressions to identify our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or our present expectations 
factors that could cause these differences include  but are not limited to  the factors set forth under part i  item a risk factors 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements  which reflect the expectations of management only as of the time such statements are made 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed that may adversely impact results of operations and financial position are changes in certain raw material prices  interest and foreign exchange rates and credit risks 
we selectively use derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage these risks 
we have no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
we are exposed to the impact of changing commodity prices for raw materials 
we may enter into commodity futures and option contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials 
our policy is to use such commodity derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage these exposures 
we do not use these financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of december  and december   we had no outstanding commodity futures or option contracts 
our debt obligations incur interest at floating rates  based on changes in the eurodollar rate  canadian bankers acceptance discount rate  canadian prime rate and us base rate interest 
to manage exposure to changing interest rates  we selectively enter into interest rate swap agreements to maintain a desirable proportion of fixed to variable rate debt 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to manage the risk associated with variable interest rates 
the variable to fixed interest rate swap was accounted for as a cash flow hedge  with the effectiveness assessment based on changes in the present value of interest payments on the underlying debt 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity date of the swap matched the principal  interest payment and maturity dates of the related debt 
the interest rate on the swap was  including applicable margin of the interest rate swap 
the underlying notional amount of the swap agreement was million 
the fair value of the interest rate swap as determined by a third party financial institution was less than million on december  at december   we had a million term loan with a weighted average interest rate of 
at december   our total debt was million with a weighted average interest rate of 
a increase in the underlying interest rate would not have had a material impact on interest expense during we are exposed to certain credit risks related to our accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers to minimize the potential exposure 
as of december  and december   we had allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily due to the write offs of uncollectible accounts that were either part of the opening balance sheet of the tom s acquisition or previously expensed in we have an exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  primarily between us and canadian dollars 
in  foreign exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our pre tax earnings by million 
the majority of revenue from our canadian operations is denominated in us dollars and a substantial portion of the operational costs  such as raw materials and direct labor  are denominated in canadian dollars 
we have entered into a series of forward currency contracts to mitigate a portion of this foreign exchange rate exposure 
these contracts have maturities through december as of december   the fair value of the liability related to the forward contracts as determined by a third party financial institution was million 
the unrealized loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at december  was million  net of tax related to the forward currency contracts 
net cash settlements under the forward contracts are reflected in revenue in the consolidated statements of income in the applicable period 
during  the indebtedness used to finance the acquisition of our canadian subsidiary was denominated in canadian dollars and served as an economic hedge of the net asset investment in the subsidiary 
the debt was repaid during  thus eliminating the hedge of the net asset investment in the subsidiary 
we recorded a gain in other comprehensive income of less than million in  million in and million in as a result of the translation of the subsidiary s financial statement into us dollars 
net commodity and packaging costs had an unfavorable impact on pre tax earnings in of million primarily due to increases in sugar and flour costs 
during  pre tax earnings were negatively impacted by increases in natural gas prices of million and increases in gasoline and diesel fuel costs of million as compared to
