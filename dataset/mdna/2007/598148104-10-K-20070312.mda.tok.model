industry overview the interactive entertainment industry is composed of hardware manufacturers  independent publishers and third party developers 
the hardware manufacturers focus primarily on the development and manufacture of hardware platforms for game play  including home game consoles which connect to a television set and self contained handheld platforms 
the hardware manufacturers also develop and publish video game software for their respective platforms in an effort to distinguish their hardware products in the marketplace 
the independent publishers are in the business of developing  publishing and  in some cases  distributing video game software 
titles published by these groups can either be developed internally or through relationships with third party developers 
third party developers are principally focused on game development and contract with independent publishers or hardware manufacturers for the publishing and distribution of their games 
the home console and handheld platform market 
historically  there have been multiple console platforms available in the market and strong competition between console manufacturers 
the success of a title on a given platform is  to an extent  dependent upon the market acceptance of that platform 
while sony was the market leader for the current generation home consoles  microsoft and nintendo are also large and viable competitors 
video game software for home consoles and handheld platforms is created by the platform manufacturers and by independent publishers using internal product development teams or independent developers contracted on a project by project basis 
platform manufacturers grant licenses to publishers to publish games for their platforms  however  they retain a significant degree of control over the content  quality and manufacturing of these games 
the publishers have the right to determine the types of games they will create subject to concept  content and quality approval by the platform manufacturers 
historically  a new generation of more technologically advanced game consoles has reached the market approximately every four to six years 
each new generation of these platforms has the capability to permit developers to create more realistic and exciting games 
at the beginning of each new generation  or cycle  during the period of rapid growth in the installed base of the new generation of consoles  software sales for the new consoles have historically experienced periods of rapid expansion  as an increasing number of new console owners purchase video games for the new consoles 
at the end of each cycle  when the introduction of the next generation of home consoles is announced  hardware and software sales related to the older generation of platforms generally diminish  and prices are discounted  as consumers defer and decrease purchases in anticipation of the new platforms and games 
the time period from the first announcement of the introduction of the first next generation home consoles until these new consoles supplant the older generation consoles in terms of software sales is referred to in the industry as the home console transition period 
the industry is currently emerging from the most recent console transition as each of the three main competitors sony  microsoft and nintendo have now released their latest home console platforms  or next generation consoles 
the primary home consoles for which we have been developing video games for in recent years can be summarized by period as follows older generation home consoles current generation home consoles next generation home consoles sony s playstation sony s playstation sony s playstation nintendo nintendo s gamecube nintendo s wii microsoft s xbox microsoft s xbox substantially all of our current development activity is focused on video games for the next generation home consoles 
microsoft launched the first next generation home console platform  xbox  in november in the us and december in europe 
nintendo released its next generation home console platform  the wii  in november in the us and then in europe and japan in december finally  sony released its next generation home console platform  the playstation  in november in both the us and japan 
sony is expected to release the playstation in europe in march the handheld platform market is largely dominated by nintendo whose products include game boy  game boy advance  game boy advance sp and the nintendo ds  which was released in november sony introduced its handheld game platform  playstation portable  in japan in and in north america in march the personal computer game market 
the market for personal computer pc games is similar to the home console video games market in many respects  including development processes and costs  time to market and marketing processes and costs 
unlike console games  pc games do not require approval from  or royalties to  any hardware manufacturer as do console games 
therefore  there are fewer barriers to entry in this market and the number of products offered to consumers is much greater 
the pc games market is not subject to video game console cycles and consequently gives publishers the ability to use pc game sales to soften the variability of console revenues during the home console transition periods 
the online and wireless markets 
emerging technologies such as the internet and wireless devices have created new revenue opportunities for video game software publishers 
online functionality in a game can be as simple as the ability to post game scores to a public leaderboard or as complex as head to head online play 
this online functionality may provide improved game play to a product and make it more compelling and marketable but generally does not generate separate revenues for the publisher 
in the future  more business models may emerge that provide distinct revenue opportunities for online functionality in games 
in addition  many games are available for play on wireless devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants 
a console or pc publisher may license the wireless rights to games to third parties who create and sell wireless products based on the licensed intellectual properties 
if the market for wireless products grows significantly  publishers for other platforms may increasingly create and market their own wireless games in the future 
distribution 
software for video game platforms is sold by mass merchandise retailers  such as wal mart and best buy  or by regional retailers  discount store chains  video rental retailers  internet based retailers  software specialty retailers and entertainment software distributors 
video game software publishers either distribute their products directly to these retailers or sell them through national distributors 
our business strategy our corporate objectives are to improve our market share  achieve consistent profitability and establish a leadership position within the global interactive entertainment industry 
we believe our ability to achieve these objectives depends on our execution of the following strategies leverage core competencies and established franchises an important part of our product focus is leveraging our established franchises and developing video games in genres in which we have a demonstrated competency  including video games targeted at mature audiences and sports games that emphasize over the top and lifestyle elements 
established franchises many of the games we have released over the past years have been best sellers and have attracted loyal fan bases 
the popularity of many of our games has enabled us to successfully market sequels  including sequels for mortal kombat  spy hunter  gauntlet  mlb slugfest  blitz and san francisco rush extreme racing 
a sequel in the mortal kombat series that we released in the fourth quarter of  mortal kombat armageddon  proved to be our second best selling game of we intend to leverage our franchises to create popular titles for play on traditional console platforms and new gaming mediums 
we also control the intellectual property rights to hundreds of classic video game titles  including titles originally released under the midway  williams and atari brands 
we have leveraged this large library of proven intellectual properties by releasing collections of arcade classics for home consoles  ten for handheld platforms and one for the pc 
over the top sports games we have enjoyed strong sales from our line of sports games  including nba ballers  the blitz franchise  nhl hitz  mlb slugfest and ready rumble boxing 
our titles in this popular category are characterized by extreme game play and the exaggerated abilities of the characters in these games  which we refer to as over the top sports entertainment 
we believe our over the top style makes these games popular and differentiates them from the simulation style of most publishers sports video games 
in future periods  we plan to release new versions of over the top sports games with novel and innovative features 
mature games the development of m rated games for consumers age and older is one of our historic strengths 
during the older generation home console cycle  from to  we were the industry leader in m rated dollar and unit sales 
we also released the most m rated titles during that period 
our most successful and profitable video game franchise  mortal kombat  is marketed to mature audiences 
we have sold over million copies of this franchise across eight major home console releases 
the majority of video game players on current consoles are over years of age and the average age of video game players is increasing 
we expect mature games to continue to be a fast growing segment in the industry 
continue to pursue the children s  licensed and pc games markets in recent years  we have increased the number of products that we develop for the children s market and have pursued more third party licenses that appeal to children and created games based on these licenses 
in  we signed publishing agreements with warner bros 
interactive entertainment  under which we have received licenses to several intellectual properties for the development of video games based on children s television programs and films for home consoles  handhelds and pc platforms 
we released the first title under these agreements  ed  edd n eddy  in the fourth quarter of in  we released three more titles under these agreements the ant bully  the grim adventures of billy mandy and happy feet 
see the tables on page for details of the territories and platforms for which these titles  as well as all of our other titles  were released during the respective periods 
we believe that there will be strong demand for children s video games  particularly games for older video game consoles and the handheld platforms  as the industry continues through the current home console transition period 
the pc game market had not been a significant part of our business in prior years 
as part of this strategy  we have recently increased our investment and resources in pc game development 
we expect that our increased focus on the development of pc titles  including the lord of the rings online shadows of angmar and unreal tournament iii  both scheduled for release in  along with additional scheduled releases of pc titles in  will increase the revenues we derive from the pc market 
develop ambitious  mass market next generation games to capitalize on the evolution of the video game market into a mass market entertainment medium  we have increased our investment in the development of video games that provide consumers with more realism and the ability to fully interact with the virtual world created by the games 
we have devoted significant resources to the development of games that are more ambitious in terms of functionality and interaction 
these games offer consumers increased playability and multiple experiences within a single video game  such as driving  fighting and shooting 
these types of games became increasingly popular in the current generation home console cycle  and we expect this trend to continue on the next generation home console platforms 
these types of games are an important element of our plan to compete for more market share in the next generation home console cycle by concept testing our video games before we green light development and focus testing our video games throughout the development process to ensure that they appeal to the mass market  including in our video games culturally engaging items such as identifiable locations and themes  popular music and entertainment stars voices and likenesses  and the use of well known directors  focusing our product development and marketing resources on the creation of a smaller number of higher quality games and the promotion of pre launch awareness of those titles and forming strategic alliances with other media companies to leverage marketing resources and demographic reach 
invest in internal product development to drive efficient production of next generation games we continue to invest in our internal product development capabilities to further improve our design and production efficiency and build creative resources 
we believe that our increased emphasis on internal product development will help us to further capitalize on our existing franchises  design new  successful titles in the future and mitigate risks we face in the next console cycle 
by building strong internal capabilities  rather than outsourcing to external third party studios  we believe we will be better positioned to control the anticipated higher development costs and longer development cycles associated with video games for next generation consoles 
since january  we have added four product development studios 
we have increased our total internal product development headcount from employees at december  to employees at december  we believe another critical component of success in the next console cycle will be the ability to develop successive iterations of high quality games efficiently  by among other things  avoiding the unnecessary re creation of technology systems and art assets 
to that end  we have invested in and pursued a product development approach that integrates the efforts of our various studios  standardizes tools and pipelines and works on a common code base to the extent possible  shares technology across studios  and institutes a high degree of peer review and intra studio resource sharing 
we believe this systematization and standardization of the technology and processes of our product development organization  will allow us to better leverage our technology and assets to lower costs and more efficiently produce new games and sequels 
expand international presence we believe that we can further expand our presence in international markets 
in fiscal  we opened an office in the united kingdom to sell our products in europe and australia 
in january  we expanded our international operations through the formation of a wholly owned german subsidiary  midway games gmbh 
germany is currently the second largest console market and the largest pc market in europe 
our german subsidiary is responsible for our sales  marketing and distribution in germany  austria and switzerland 
in november  we also formed a french subsidiary  midway games sas  to further bolster our european distribution capabilities 
we believe that directly marketing our products in foreign markets will produce higher sales and lower costs than if we relied solely on the use of third party distributors 
in addition  to expand our presence outside of north america  we are developing titles that we believe will have a stronger global appeal 
products we sell games primarily in north america  europe and australia for the major video game platforms  including sony s playstation ps and the playstation portable psp  microsoft s xbox and xbox  and nintendo s gamecube ngc  wii  game boy advance gba and nintendo ds ds  as well as for pcs 
most of our video games currently have suggested retail prices on the initial release date in north america ranging from to for home console games  to for handheld games and to for pc games 
most of our video games currently have suggested retail prices on the initial release date in international markets ranging from to for home console games  to for handheld games and to for pc games 
our current development effort is focused on games for the next generation of home console platforms including sony s playstation ps  microsoft s xbox and nintendo s wii 
we released our first video games for the next generation of home console platforms in the fourth quarter of  including blitz the league for the xbox and a number of children s titles for the nintendo wii 
we have not yet released any video games for the ps we generally expect retail price ranges for our frontline next generation video games on the initial release date to increase from those for our current platform releases 
we receive license or royalty fees for the use of certain of our intellectual property by third parties 
these third parties use our intellectual property to  among other things  sell video games in parts of the world where we do not currently do business  convert video games to play on alternative platforms eg cellular phones  and include our video games or intellectual property in products  software or online services that they offer 
many of our games incorporate a variety of online capabilities and features 
online functionality may increase the playability of a product and make it more compelling and marketable  but it does not generate separate revenues for us at this time 
from time to time  we have purchased distribution rights to games under development by third parties 
some of these games are sequels to games that have previously been successfully released 
historically  a limited number of products have generated a disproportionately large amount of our revenues 
in  and  our mortal kombat video games accounted for  and of our revenues  respectively 
video game releases during  we released the following video games video game title platform territory blitz overtime psp north america blitz the league xbox north america gauntlet seven sorrows ps  xbox international happy feet ps  wii  pc  gba  ds north america  international happy feet ngc north america la rush pc north america  international maya the bee gba  ds international midway arcade treasures deluxe edition pc north america midway arcade treasures extended play psp international mlb slugfest ps  xbox north america mortal kombat armageddon ps north america  international mortal kombat armageddon xbox north america mortal kombat unchained psp north america  international myst psp international nba ballers phenom ps  xbox north america nba ballers rebound psp north america rampage total destruction ps  wii north america  international rampage total destruction ngc north america rise fall civilizations at war pc north america  international rush psp north america  international spyhunter nowhere to run ps north america  international spyhunter nowhere to run xbox north america the ant bully ps  pc  gba north america  international the ant bully ngc  wii north america the grim adventures of billy mandy ps  ngc  wii  gba north america unreal tournament anthology pc north america  international video game releases during  we released the following video games video game title platform territory area ps  xbox  pc north america  international blitz the league ps  xbox north america earth pc north america ed  edd n eddy ps  gba  pc north america  international ed  edd n eddy xbox  ngc north america gauntlet seven sorrows ps  xbox north america la rush ps  xbox north america  international maya the bee gba international midway arcade treasures extended play psp north america midway arcade treasures ps  xbox north america  international midway arcade treasures ngc north america mortal kombat deception ngc north america mortal kombat shaolin monks ps  xbox north america  international narc xbox north america  international narc ps north america the suffering ties that bind ps  xbox  pc north america  international shadow hearts covenant ps international unreal championship the liandri conflict xbox north america  international products we expect to release stranglehold  our first multi genre action game  or mag  title for the next generation home consoles  on the ps and xbox  as well as for the pc  later in stranglehold is a third person shooter developed in collaboration with john woo  director of the action film hard boiled  and features the talents of chow yun fat reprising his role as inspector tequila 
in addition  we expect our releases to include blacksite area  the sequel to our release  for the ps  xbox and pc  along with hour of victory for the xbox  unreal tournament iii for the xbox and pc  and the lord of the rings online shadows of angmar for the pc 
we also expect to release other high quality titles on the next generation consoles  the handheld platforms and the pc throughout product development we seek to develop video games that are action packed and exciting  and which provide sufficient challenges at various levels of proficiency to encourage repeated play 
each concept is reviewed initially for viability and evaluated relative to several factors  including consumer purchase intent and whether the proposed product fits within our general strategy and profitability objectives 
our management team meets regularly to formally review and evaluate the progress and quality of each title in development 
our game development personnel are organized into teams 
we are focused on sharing the technologies and resources developed by one studio among the other studios in order to maximize our development efficiency and provide our teams with the tools to produce the best video games possible 
the internal product development teams operate in studio environments that encourage creativity  productivity and cooperation 
we believe that this environment  together with a compensation structure that rewards development teams for the success of their games  enables us to attract and retain highly talented game developers 
since january  we have acquired four internal product development studios  thereby acquiring key personnel 
we believe that the acquisition of these privately held software developers strengthens our internal product development function and reinforces our ability to create high quality games 
we currently have product development studios in chicago  illinois  san diego  california  seattle  washington  austin  texas  moorpark  california  and newcastle  united kingdom 
the developers are supported by state of the art game development technology that allows for the creation of cutting edge  three dimensional graphics and advanced audio effects 
in an effort to reduce development costs  we have developed and acquired a substantial library of proprietary software and development tools  and continually emphasize and support the sharing of software and development tools among development teams and studios 
use of these tools streamlines the development process  allowing members of the development teams to focus their efforts on the game play and design aspects of the product under development 
we have also developed software tools to expedite conversion of software from one hardware format to another and to provide sound and special visual effects 
we continually create and acquire new software and development tools and refine and upgrade our existing tools 
we expect the development cycle for video games for the next generation of consoles to range from to months  compared to the development cycle for games on the current generation of consoles of to months  depending on the specific software requirements 
the development cycle for a new video game for the pc typically ranges from to months 
we expect our costs related to developing titles on the next generation of consoles will generally range between million to million per title  which represents a substantial increase in costs incurred to develop current generation titles  which have ranged from million to million 
because of the increasingly complex technology and software involved  both the time and cost to develop games have increased during the past few years 
we believe that we can generate significant incremental revenue from our games by introducing them on additional platforms at a much lower cost than the development cost for introducing the game on the initial platform 
converting an existing game from one platform to another for the current generation platforms has typically taken three to months 
this period may overlap with the development period of the original version of the game and has typically cost less than million 
our current game development is primarily focused on the next generation home consoles and we expect to release titles for all of these new consoles in the near future 
the first games on the next generation consoles should be more expensive than subsequent projects  as they involve the development of game engines  technologies and art resources that we plan to use on subsequent next generation projects 
we use both our own personnel and independent third parties to develop video games 
we select third parties based on their capabilities  suitability  availability and cost 
our contracts with these developers generally provide that we own the video game developed and protect the confidentiality of the development process and work product 
these contracts are structured to give these developers incentives to provide timely and satisfactory performance of the development by associating payment of development fees with performance of substantive development milestones and by providing for the payment of royalties to the developer based on sales of the product developed  after we recoup the development cost 
to address development risks  we retain the right to discontinue development both without cause or for cause 
with cause generally includes failure to timely and satisfactorily perform the development  a change in the control of the developer or the departure of specified key personnel from the developer s employ 
we believe that as a result of consolidation in our industry  there are now fewer highly skilled independent developers available to us 
competition for highly skilled developers is intense in our industry  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining these developers 
we are required to submit games to the platform manufacturers for approval prior to publishing a game for their platforms 
additionally  prior to release  each product undergoes careful quality assurance testing which involves technical review of each component of the final product and testing on the applicable platforms 
we endeavor to comply with the rules established by a domestic ratings board voluntarily established by the video game industry and some foreign countries ratings boards  and we label our products with these ratings 
we incurred research and development expenses of million in  compared to million in and million in see also note to our consolidated financial statements for information about capitalized development costs 
marketing and distribution we market our video games under the midway trademark 
we market through our internal sales staff and through independent sales representatives  distributors and resellers to over  stores  including mass merchandisers  foreign  national and regional retailers  discount store chains  and video rental retailers 
it is customary for the independent sales representatives and distributors of our video games who are assigned specific customers to also distribute games produced by other publishers 
distribution channels are dominated by a select group of companies  and a publisher s access to retail shelf space is a significant competitive factor 
as a result of our recent efforts to improve product quality and our commitment to increase promotion of our products  we have been able to improve our ability to obtain shelf space for our product line with key retailers and distributors 
our principal customers are mass merchandisers such as wal mart  best buy and target and software specialty retailers such as gamestop 
in  wal mart and gamestop were our two largest customers  representing and of our total net revenues  respectively 
in  gamestop including eb games which merged with gamestop in october and wal mart were our two largest customers  representing and of our total net revenues  respectively 
in and  respectively  and of our net revenues were attributable to our five largest customers  and and of our net revenues were attributable to our ten largest customers 
we warrant to our customers that the medium on which our software is recorded is free from defects for a period of days 
defective product returns have historically not been material relative to our total net revenues 
our selling and distribution efforts are supported by marketing programs  which emphasize early product awareness through focused public relations efforts that precede our media spending  brand recognition  dealer merchandising opportunities and celebrity endorsements 
our marketing activities include television  on line and print advertising  retail store promotions  direct mailings  user support programs and our website 
we also use a store oriented marketing approach  which includes point of purchase promotions  use of display cards and other forms of merchandise displays 
we provide technical support for our products through a customer support department  which is staffed by personnel trained to respond to customer inquiries 
we are continuing to focus our marketing resources on the enhancement of pre launch awareness and visibility of our games with consumers  using the internet and long term advance planning and staged information release 
additionally  we continue to commit significant spending on media advertising and retail marketing for all titles  with a particular emphasis on titles that we believe have the greatest chance for commercial success 
our office in london  england sells directly to retailers and distributors in the united kingdom  and through distribution partners in europe  australia and south africa 
in january  we established a sales office in germany  which allows us to sell directly to retailers and distributors in german speaking territories 
germany is the second largest console territory  and the largest pc territory  in the european marketplace 
in november  we formed a french subsidiary  midway games sas  to bolster our european distribution capabilities 
we continue to explore other methods by which we can improve our distribution efficiency and grow our business in europe and other international markets

risk factors we face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries  including our ability to generate international demand for our products 
competition the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 
it is characterized by the continuous introduction of new titles and the development of new technologies 
our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large corporations with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
the principal factors of competition in our industry are the ability to select and develop popular titles  the ability to identify and obtain rights to commercially marketable intellectual properties  and the ability to adapt products for use with new technologies 
successful competition in our market is also based on price  access to retail shelf space  product quality  product enhancements  brand recognition  marketing support and access to distribution channels 
we compete with microsoft  nintendo and sony  who publish software for their respective systems 
we also compete with numerous companies licensed by the platform manufacturers to develop or publish software products for use with their respective systems 
these competitors include activision  atari  capcom  electronic arts  konami  namco  sci entertainment  sega  take two interactive software  thq  ubisoft entertainment and vivendi universal games  among others 
we face additional competition from the entry of new companies into our market  including large diversified entertainment companies 
our competitors with greater resources are able to spend more time and money on concept and focus testing  game development  product testing and marketing 
we believe that we have comparable access to distribution channels in north america  however  in europe and asia the distribution networks are segmented  the barriers to entry are high and some of our competitors have better access to these markets 
there is also intense competition for shelf space among video game developers and publishers  many of whom have greater brand name recognition  significantly more titles and greater leverage with retailers and distributors than we do 
in addition  regardless of our competitor s financial resources or size  our success depends on our ability to successfully execute our competitive strategies 
we believe that a number of factors provide us with competitive opportunities in the industry  including the standardization of software development tools  the creation of libraries for storing and sharing artwork  and our ability to efficiently share developed assets across game development teams 
we believe our product development team incentive structure allows us to attract and retain top quality talent and motivate our teams to efficiently develop successful games 
in addition  we believe that our most popular franchise  mortal kombat  along with other successful titles such as blitz the league and midway arcade treasures  provide us with strong brand recognition and a competitive advantage in the marketing of our products 
the number of new video game releases for pcs in a given year is much higher than the number of new video game releases for home consoles and handheld platforms 
the barriers to entry in the pc market are lower because there are no publishing agreements with or royalties to be paid to hardware manufacturers 
we believe our strategy of publishing pc titles within established franchises and games developed by studios well known within the industry allows us to quickly develop market share with a minimal investment in sales and distribution infrastructure 
manufacturing and distribution the manufacturers of the home and handheld video game platforms may manufacture our video games for us or require us to use their designees 
the platform manufacturers charge us a fixed amount for each software disc or cartridge that they manufacture  which includes manufacturing  printing  and packaging fees as well as a royalty for the use of their technology and intellectual property  or a royalty if their third party designees perform the manufacturing 
the platform manufacturer may change its fees without our consent 
we believe that the platform manufacturers have plentiful sources of supply for the raw materials that they need to manufacture our products 
we contract with disc replicators for the manufacture of pc game units 
there is competition in this manufacturing field  and we have the opportunity to negotiate the price of manufacturing these games and their packaging 
we believe that these manufacturers also have plentiful sources of supply for the raw materials that they will need to manufacture our products 
we are responsible in most cases for resolving  at our expense  any applicable warranty or repair claim 
we have not experienced material costs from warranty or repair claims in recent years 
production is based upon estimated demand for each specific title 
the level of the inventory of finished goods depends upon anticipated market demand during the life of a specific game title 
at the time a product is approved for manufacturing  we must generally provide the platform manufacturer with a purchase order for that product and  in some cases  either an irrevocable letter of credit for of the purchase price or cash in advance 
most of our products are manufactured for us on an as is and where is basis  and delivery is at our expense and risk 
initial orders generally require seven to days to manufacture depending on the platform 
reorders of disc based products generally require only seven to days to manufacture  while reorders of cartridge based products require approximately to days to manufacture 
shipping of orders requires an additional three to ten days  depending on the mode of transport and location of the manufacturer 
only nintendo s game boy advance and nintendo ds use cartridges  while both current generation and next generation home consoles  playstation portable and pc games are all disc based 
we lease a distribution facility in dallas  texas  from which we distribute our video games throughout north america 
some products are imported into the united states  cleared by customs and transferred to our distribution facility  where they are unpacked and shipped to our customers 
at times  some components of our products are assembled into finished products for us by third parties prior to their transfer to our distribution facility 
we participate in the electronic data interchange program maintained by most of our large customers 
the electronic data interchange program allows us to receive purchase orders from our customers  and to send invoices to our customers  in an agreed upon standardized format via electronic transmission between computer systems 
we generally fill re orders from inventory within two days 
as a result  our video games traditionally have no backlog of orders 
we ship products to a customer only upon receipt of a purchase order from that customer 
due to the relatively short time frame needed to reorder inventory  we are generally able to manage our inventory levels to closely approximate actual orders received or anticipated to be received 
we will generally receive information from our largest customers on their intended order quantities prior to placing our orders with the manufacturers 
our standard payment terms with our customers are days or days from the date of shipment of the goods 
in general  we do not permit extended payment terms with our customers 
in some cases involving inventory closeouts  payment terms are further extended  typically not more than days 
we often provide markdowns or other credits on varying terms to customers holding slow moving inventory of our video games 
we often grant discounts to  and sometimes accept product returns from  these customers 
at the time of product shipment  we establish allowances  including allowances under our practices for price protection  returns and discounts  which estimate the potential for future returns and markdowns of products based on historical return rates  seasonality of sales  retailer inventories of our products and other factors 
see item a 
risk factors if product returns and price adjustments exceed our allowances  we will incur additional charges  which would have an adverse affect on our results of operations below 
licenses and intellectual property platform licenses 
the platform manufacturers require that publishers obtain a license from them to develop and market games for play on their platforms 
generally  we are required to pay royalties pursuant to these licenses  and such licenses are typically terminable by the licensor in the event of our breach of the license and other events 
we have non exclusive licenses from microsoft  nintendo and sony under which we develop and market software products for their current platforms 
each platform manufacturer requires that the software and a prototype of each title  together with all related artwork and documentation  be submitted for its pre publication approval 
this approval is generally discretionary 
upon expiration of a platform license  we usually have a limited period to sell off our inventory subject to that license  after which time any remaining inventory is generally required to be destroyed 
microsoft  nintendo and sony are among the largest publishers of software for use on their respective systems  and they compete directly with us 
see item a 
risk factors if game platform manufacturers refuse to license their platforms to us or do not manufacture our games on a timely basis or at all  our revenues would be adversely affected below 
intellectual property licenses 
while we develop original proprietary games  some of our games are licensed from third party developers or based on trademarks and other rights and properties owned by third parties  such as the national basketball association and television and film production studios 
typically  we are obligated to make minimum guaranteed royalty payments over the term of these licenses and to advance payment against these guarantees 
license agreements generally extend for a term of two to three years  are terminable in the event of a material breach by us  including failure to pay any amounts owing to the licensor in a timely manner  and other events 
some licenses are limited to specific territories or platforms 
each license typically provides that the licensor retains the right to leverage the licensed property for all other purposes  including the right to license the property for use with other products and  in some cases  software for other interactive hardware platforms 
patent  trademark and copyright protection 
each software title may embody a number of separately protected intellectual property rights  including trademarks associated with elements of the game  such as team logos  trademarks under which the game is marketed  the copyrights for the game software  including the game s audiovisual elements  and the patents for inventions in the game software 
we have hundreds of trademark registrations worldwide for our games  and we apply for trademark protection for all of our game titles  other than those licensed from third parties 
these registrations are renewable  potentially indefinitely  as long as we continue to use the trademarks 
notwithstanding our patent  copyright and trademark protection  our competitors can effectively compete against us or bring infringement actions against unauthorized duplication of software products 
each console or handheld game also includes patents  copyrights and trademarks licensed from the platform manufacturer 
elements of some of our titles are owned by third parties and licensed to us 
we rely on these third parties for protection of our licensed intellectual property rights 
their failure to adequately protect these rights could have a material adverse effect on us 
the platform manufacturers incorporate security devices in the games that they manufacture for us  and also in their platforms  which seek to prevent unlicensed software products from being played on their platforms 
we rely upon each platform manufacturer for protection of this intellectual property from infringement 
we bear the risk of claims of infringement brought by third parties arising from the sale of software with respect to intellectual property supplied by third party developers and embodied in our software products 
our agreements with these outside developers generally require the developers to indemnify us for costs and damages incurred in connection with these claims 
these software developers  however  may not have sufficient resources to indemnify us for any claims that may arise 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal and we have generally experienced higher revenues in the quarter ended december due to customer purchases before the year end retail holiday selling season 
significant working capital is required to finance high levels of inventories and accounts receivable during that quarter 
employees as of march   we had approximately employees  approximately of whom are members of our development staff and approximately of whom are members of our sales and marketing staffs 
we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
item a 
risk factors 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could significantly harm our business  results of operations or financial condition or have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock or convertible senior notes 
in that case  you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have experienced operating and net losses in recent years  and we expect to incur future losses 
we last reported an annual operating profit in fiscal for each of the last three years  we reported the following operating losses million for  million for  and million for we believe that our losses have been attributable primarily to releasing titles that failed to gain popularity and generate expected sales  increasing costs of developing new games for current and next generation platforms  a tendency for retailers to stock only video games for which consumer demand is expected to be strongest  and weakness in the home video game industry during the home console transition periods 
we may not become profitable again despite our efforts 
if our new products fail to gain market acceptance  we may not have sufficient revenues to pay our expenses and to develop a continuous stream of new games 
our success depends on generating revenues from new products 
the market for video game products is subject to continually changing consumer preferences and the frequent introduction of new products 
as a result  video game products typically have short market lives spanning only three to months 
our new products may not achieve and sustain market acceptance sufficient to generate revenues to cover our costs and allow us to become profitable 
our typical cost to develop a new game for the current generation of platforms has ranged from million to million 
in addition  we estimate that the cost will range between million and million to develop next generation platform games 
if our new products  and in particular  our frontline titles  fail to gain market acceptance  we may not have sufficient revenues to develop a continuous stream of new games  which we believe is essential to covering costs and achieving future profitability 
in  we released frontline titles for home consoles and the pc  which accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues for that year 
product development schedules are long and frequently unpredictable  and we may experience delays in introducing new products  which may adversely affect our revenues 
the development cycle for our products is long  typically ranging from to months 
we expect the development cycle for next generation platforms to range from to months 
in addition  the creative process inherent in video game development makes the length of the development cycle difficult to predict  especially in connection with products for a new hardware platform involving new technologies  learning and development tools 
as a result  we have from time to time in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  delays in product introductions 
if an unanticipated delay affects the release of a video game  we may not achieve anticipated revenues for that game  for example  if the game is delayed until after an important selling season or after market interest in the subject matter of the game has begun to decline 
a delay in introducing a new video game could also require us to spend more development resources to complete the game  which would increase our costs and lower our margins  and could affect the development schedule for future products 
our market is subject to rapid technological change  and if we do not adapt to  and appropriately allocate our new resources among  emerging technologies  our revenues would be negatively affected 
technology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry 
we must continually anticipate and adapt our products to emerging technologies 
when we choose to incorporate a new technology into a product or to develop a product for a new platform  operating system or media format  we often are required to make a substantial investment one to two years prior to the introduction of the product 
if we invest in the development of video games incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success  our revenues from those products likely will be lower than we anticipated and may not cover our development costs 
if  on the other hand  we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms that achieve significant commercial success  our revenues would also be adversely affected  and it may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology or platform 
any such failure to adapt to  and appropriately allocate resources among  emerging technologies would harm our competitive position  reduce our market share and significantly increase the time we take to bring popular products to market 
if consumers discontinue purchasing our products for current generation home consoles or the prices for our current generation products further decrease as a result of the current home console transition period  our revenues and margins would be adversely affected 
most of our revenues are generated from the sale of video game software for home consoles 
microsoft launched the first next generation home console platform  xbox  in november in the us and december in europe 
nintendo released its next generation home console platform  the wii  in november in the us and then in europe and japan in december finally  sony released its next generation home console platform  the ps  in november in both the us and japan 
sony is expected to release the ps in europe in march we have only recently begun to release video games for the next generation home consoles 
consumers may discontinue purchasing video games for use on current generation home consoles  and video game prices for the current generation home consoles may further decrease as the next generation home consoles become more established in the marketplace 
this combination of reduced game sales and lower prices contributed to our net losses in and  when each of microsoft  nintendo and sony announced new hardware platforms 
we expect a similar market situation to occur until next generation home consoles in the marketplace supplant current generation home consoles in terms of software sales 
if we are unable to introduce games that are less susceptible to these market conditions  or we are unable to timely meet consumers demand for next generation products  our revenues and margins would be adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  making our results difficult to predict 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in net revenues and other operating results due to a variety of factors  including variations in the level and duration of market acceptance of our products  delays and timing of product development and introductions  fluctuations in our mix of products with varying profit margins  dependence on a relatively limited number of products in any quarter to produce revenues  introduction and market penetration of game platforms  the amount of royalties payable by us for the content contained in our video games  development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of our products  peak demand during the year end retail holiday selling season  which typically results in higher revenues in our fourth quarter  changes in our pricing practices and those of our competitors  the accuracy of the forecasts of consumer demand made by retailers and by us  and the timing of orders from major customers  order cancellations and delays in shipment 
these factors combine to make it difficult to predict our results of operations for any particular quarter 
we base our purchasing levels and marketing expenses  in part  on our expectations of future sales 
as a result  operating results in any particular quarter may be adversely affected by a decline in net revenues or a failure to meet our sales expectations in that quarter 
restrictive debt covenants in our credit facility and the indenture for our convertible senior notes issued in may limit our operating flexibility  and all amounts outstanding under our credit facility  including our term loan  and our convertible senior notes may become immediately payable if we default under the facility or the indenture 
our credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc and the indenture for our million convertible senior notes due the notes limit our ability to finance operations  service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
specifically  our credit facility or the notes indenture restrict our ability to  among other things make payments  including dividends or other distributions  on our capital stock  except in shares of common stock  incur additional indebtedness  sell  lease  license or dispose of any of our assets  make loans or investments  acquire companies or businesses  cause or permit a change of control  repurchase or redeem any shares of our capital stock  issue or sell securities of our subsidiaries  and make capital expenditures 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain minimum levels of cash and borrowing availability under the revolving line of credit and to deliver periodic financial reports and projections satisfactory to the lender 
our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  may permit acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility  the notes and our million convertible senior notes due the notes  together with the notes  the notes 
our failure to comply with our obligations under the indentures for the notes may also result in an event of default under our credit facility that could result in acceleration of the indebtedness under our credit facility 
we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all 
increased leverage may harm our results of operations and financial condition 
our total consolidated debt and capital lease obligation as of december  was approximately million  including the portion of our credit facility and capital lease obligation that we have classified as short term  and represents approximately of our total capitalization as of that date 
our consolidated debt and capital lease obligation above includes the notes at their stated amount of million and has not been reduced for the  discount recorded on the notes 
this amount also includes the  letters of credit outstanding at december  the indenture for the notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  and under specified circumstances under the indenture for the notes  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our level of indebtedness could have important consequences  because it could affect our ability to satisfy our debt and capital lease obligations  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to interest and principal payments on our debt and capital lease  thereby reducing our ability to fund operations  working capital  capital expenditures  expansion  acquisitions  or general corporate or other purposes  it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  it may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness  and it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business  our industry or the economy in general 
the notes include a conversion rate adjustment provision that  if triggered  could result in recording a maximum discount of million that would be recognized as interest expense over the period from april   or in some cases september   through april   the date at which the holders may first require us to redeem the notes 
this conversion rate adjustment provision  if triggered  may harm our results of operations and financial condition 
see further discussion of the notes conversion rate adjustment provision and the circumstances under which the conversion rate adjustment may be triggered at note to the consolidated financial statements 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to our success in obtaining necessary approvals and commercializing our product candidates  general economic conditions  and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot give assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other needs 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness  we may be required  among other things  to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the convertible senior notes  sell assets  and or reduce or delay planned expenditures on research and development and or commercialization activities 
any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all 
in addition  we cannot give assurances that any of the above actions would provide sufficient funds to enable us to service our debt 
if in the future we need to seek additional capital due to continuing operating losses or otherwise  we may incur additional expenses in the form of periodic interest or other debt service payments  or our stockholders may suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of common stock 
if we continue to generate operating losses  our working capital and cash resources may not be adequate to allow us to implement our business strategies 
as a result  we may need to seek capital in the future  including through the issuance of debt or equity securities  or through other financings 
if we borrow additional funds  we likely will be obligated to make additional periodic dividend  interest or other debt service payments and may be subject to additional restrictive covenants 
if we seek financing through the sale of equity securities  our stockholders would suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of common stock 
additionally  we are not certain that we would be able to raise additional capital in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our market is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 
it is characterized by the continuous introduction of new titles and the development of new technologies 
our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large corporations with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
the principal factors of competition in our industry are the ability to select and develop popular titles  the ability to identify and obtain rights to commercially marketable intellectual properties  and the ability to adapt products for use with new technologies 
successful competition in our market is also based on price  access to retail shelf space  product quality  product enhancements  brand recognition  marketing support and access to distribution channels 
we compete with microsoft  nintendo and sony  who publish software for their respective systems 
we also compete with numerous companies licensed by the platform manufacturers to develop or publish software products for use with their respective systems 
these competitors include activision  atari  capcom  electronic arts  konami  namco  sci entertainment  sega  take two interactive software  thq  ubisoft entertainment and vivendi universal games  among others 
we face additional competition from the entry of new companies into our market  including large diversified entertainment companies 
our competitors with greater resources are able to spend more time and money on concept and focus testing  game development  product testing and marketing 
we believe that we have comparable access to distribution channels in north america  however  in europe and asia the distribution networks are segmented  the barriers to entry are high and some of our competitors have better access to these markets 
there is also intense competition for shelf space among video game developers and publishers  many of whom have greater brand name recognition  significantly more titles and greater leverage with retailers and distributors than we do 
in addition  regardless of our competitors financial resources or size  our success depends on our ability to successfully execute our competitive strategies 
the number of new video game releases for pcs in a given year is much higher than the number of new video game releases for home consoles and handheld platforms 
the barriers to entry in the pc market are lower because there are no publishing agreements with or royalties to be paid to the hardware manufacturers 
we believe that large diversified entertainment  cable and telecommunications companies  in addition to large software companies  are increasing their focus on the interactive entertainment software market  which will likely result in consolidation and greater competition 
we also compete with providers of alternative forms of entertainment  such as providers of non interactive entertainment  including movies  television and music  and sporting goods providers 
if the relative popularity of video games were to decline  our revenues  results of operations and financial condition likely would be harmed 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we could lose sales  market share  opportunities to license marketable intellectual property and access to next generation platform technology 
we also could experience difficulty hiring and retaining qualified software developers and other employees 
any of these consequences would significantly harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if product returns and price adjustments exceed our allowances  we will incur additional charges  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we often provide markdowns or other credits on varying terms to retailers and distributors holding slow moving inventory of our video games 
we also often grant discounts to  and sometimes accept product returns from  these customers 
at the time of product shipment  we establish allowances for the anticipated effect of our price protection  return and discount practices 
we establish allowances for a particular game based on a number of factors  including our estimates of the rate of retail sales and the potential for future returns and markdowns based on historical return rates and retailer inventories of our products 
if product returns  markdowns and credits exceed our allowances  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
if game platform manufacturers refuse to license their platforms to us or do not manufacture our games on a timely basis or at all  our revenues would be adversely affected 
we sell our products for use on proprietary game platforms manufactured by other companies  including microsoft  nintendo and sony 
these companies can significantly affect our business because we may only publish our games for play on their game platforms if we receive a platform license from them  which is renewable at their discretion  prices for platform licenses may be economically prohibitive  we must obtain their prior review and approval to publish games on their platforms  if the popularity of a game platform declines or  if the manufacturer stops manufacturing a platform  does not meet the demand for a platform or delays the introduction of a platform in a region important to us  the games that we have published and that we are developing for that platform would likely produce lower sales than we anticipate  these manufacturers control the manufacture of  or approval to manufacture  and manufacturing costs of our game discs and cartridges  and these manufacturers have the exclusive right to protect the intellectual property rights to their respective hardware platforms and technology and discourage others from producing unauthorized software for their platforms that compete with our games 
in addition  the interactive entertainment software products that we develop for platforms offered by microsoft  nintendo or sony generally are manufactured exclusively by that platform manufacturer or its approved replicator 
these manufacturers generally have approval and other rights that provide them with substantial influence over our costs and the release schedule of our products 
each of these manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platform 
a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors  especially if their products compete with our products 
any unanticipated delays in the release of our products or increase in our development  manufacturing  marketing or distribution costs as a result of actions by these manufacturers would significantly harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
approximately half of our total net revenues are attributable to our five largest customers 
wal mart and gamestop were our two largest customers in wal mart accounted for of our total net revenues for while gamestop accounted for of our total net revenues for gamestop including eb games which merged with gamestop in october and wal mart were our two largest customers in gamestop accounted for of our total net revenues for while wal mart accounted for of our total net revenues for in  of our total net revenues was derived from our five largest customers and was attributable to our ten largest customers 
in  of our total net revenues were derived from our five largest customers and were attributable to our ten largest customers 
we have no agreements with any of our customers that guarantee future purchases 
as a result  any of our customers may reduce or terminate purchases from us at any time 
a substantial reduction or termination of purchases by one or more of our largest customers could substantially reduce our revenues 
a business failure by any of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our revenues and our ability to collect receivables 
we typically make sales on credit  with terms that vary depending upon the customer and other factors 
normally we do not hold any collateral to secure payment by our customers 
additionally  we do not factor any of our receivables 
while we attempt to monitor carefully the creditworthiness of our customers  we bear the risk of their inability to pay us as well as any delay in payment 
any financial difficulties or business failure experienced by one of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on both our ability to collect receivables and results of operations 
rating systems for interactive entertainment software  potential legislation and vendor or consumer opposition could inhibit sales of our products 
trade organizations within the video game industry have established rules regarding rating systems and the labeling of video game products to indicate to consumers the amount and nature of violence  mature language  sexually explicit material and other content that some consumers might find objectionable 
some countries have also established rating systems as prerequisites for sales of interactive entertainment software in those countries 
in some instances  we may be required to modify our products to comply with the requirements of these rating systems  which could delay the release of those products in those countries 
we label our north american products with these ratings e age and older  e age and older  t age and over and m age and over 
many of our new titles are designed for an m  or mature  rating  and one of our key strategies is to focus on games with mature content 
the development of m rated video games for consumers age and older is one of our historic strengths 
the majority of video game players on current consoles are over years of age and approximately of all video games sold are m rated titles 
proposals have been made for legislation to prohibit the sale of some m rated video games to under audiences and consumer groups have participated in public demonstrations and media campaigns to restrict sales 
in addition  retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing mature content  which may limit the potential market for our m rated products and harm our business and results of operations 
if any groups including foreign  national and local political and regulatory bodies were to target our m rated titles  we might be required to significantly change  delay or discontinue a particular title  which in the case of our best selling titles could seriously harm our business 
although we expect mature games to continue to be one of the fastest growing segments in the industry  it could seriously harm our business if the mature games segment declines significantly or if our ability to sell mature rated games to the and over audience is restricted 
lawsuits alleging damages as a result of our video games may require significant expenditures  divert the attention of management and generate negative publicity  and thereby have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
from time to time we have been the target of lawsuits seeking damages for injuries  including wrongful death  allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of our video games 
any lawsuit may require significant expenditures  divert the attention of our management and generate negative publicity about us or our products  which could negatively influence the buying decisions of consumers resulting in lost sales  boycotts or other similar efforts by retailers or end users 
any of these consequences could significantly harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products  and any increase in the amounts we have to pay to have our products manufactured or any delay or interruption in production would negatively affect both our ability to make timely product introductions and our results of operations 
our products are manufactured by third parties who set the manufacturing prices for our products 
therefore  we depend on these manufacturers  including platform manufacturers  to fill our orders on a timely basis and to manufacture our products at an acceptable cost 
increases in our manufacturing costs would adversely affect our margins and therefore our results of operations 
in addition  if we experience manufacturing delays or interruptions  we would not achieve anticipated revenues 
we have limited control over the personnel  scheduling and use of resources by third parties that develop certain of our game titles  and our revenues may be adversely affected by delays caused by these developers 
approximately half of our games currently under development are being developed by third parties 
the number of titles developed for us by third parties varies from quarter to quarter 
we have less control over a game developed by a third party because we cannot control the developer s personnel  schedule or resources 
in addition  any of our third party developers could experience a business failure  be acquired by one of our competitors or experience some other disruption 
any of these factors could cause a game not to meet our quality standards or expectations  or not to be completed on time or at all 
if this happens with a game under development  we could lose anticipated revenues from the game or our entire investment in the game 
if we are not able to maintain or acquire licenses for intellectual property necessary to the success of some of our games  or if that intellectual property does not achieve market acceptance  our revenues would be adversely affected 
some of our games are based on intellectual properties owned by third parties  such as the national basketball association or television and film production studios 
our future success may depend on our ability to maintain existing licenses and to acquire additional licenses for popular intellectual properties 
there is intense competition for these licenses  and competitors may obtain exclusive licenses to market games using these or other desirable brands 
we may not be successful in maintaining or acquiring intellectual property rights with significant commercial value on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could adversely affect our ability to produce games that achieve market acceptance 
because some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are  have a higher degree of brand recognition and have developed more popular games  they may be more successful than we are in licensing the most desirable content 
our intellectual property licenses generally require that we submit new products developed under licenses to the licensor for approval prior to release 
this approval is generally discretionary 
rejection or delay in approval of a product by a licensor could prevent us from selling the product 
in addition  our failure to meet their standards would harm our ability to obtain future licenses 
the owners of intellectual property licensed by us generally reserve the right to protect the intellectual property against infringement 
if any of these owners fails to protect its own  or infringes someone else s  intellectual property  it would weaken the value of our license and expose us to damages 
we may experience increased costs to continue to attract and retain senior management and highly qualified software developers 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the performance of senior management and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified software developers 
we believe that as a result of consolidation in our industry  there are now fewer highly skilled independent developers available to us 
competition for these developers is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining them on terms acceptable to us or at all 
an increase in the costs necessary to attract and retain skilled developers and any delays resulting from the inability to attract necessary developers or departures may adversely affect our revenues  margins and results of operations 
the loss of a member of our senior management personnel could also have a negative effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our products contain errors  our reputation  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
as video games incorporate new technologies  adapt to new hardware platforms and become more complex  the risk of undetected errors in products when first introduced increases 
if  despite our testing procedures  errors are found in new products after shipments have been made  we could experience a loss of revenues  delay in timely market acceptance of our products and damage to our reputation  any of which may negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property  our revenues may be adversely affected 
the intellectual property embodied in our video games  especially our games for play on pcs  is susceptible to infringement  particularly through unauthorized copying of the games  or piracy 
the increasing availability of high bandwidth internet service has made  and will likely continue to make  piracy of video games more common 
infringement of our intellectual property may adversely affect our revenues through lost sales or licensing fees  particularly where consumers obtain pirated video game copies rather than copies sold by us  or damage to our reputation where consumers are wrongly led by infringers to believe that low quality infringing material originated from us 
preventing and curbing infringement through enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult  costly and time consuming  and thereby ultimately not cost effective  especially where the infringement takes place in foreign countries where the laws are less favorable to rights holders or not sufficiently developed to afford the level of protection we desire 
if we infringe the intellectual property of others  our costs may rise and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
although we take precautions to avoid infringing the intellectual property of others  it is possible that we or our third party developers have done so or may do so in the future 
the increasing number and complexity of elements in our products that results from the advances in the capabilities of video game platforms increases the probability that infringement may occur 
claims of infringement  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  costly and difficult to defend 
moreover  as a result of disputes over intellectual property  we may be required to discontinue the distribution of our products  obtain a license or redesign our products  any of which could result in substantial costs and material delays and materially adversely affect our results of operations 
we face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries  including our ability to generate international demand for our products 
we conduct a portion of our development and publishing activities in foreign countries  and we derive an increasing proportion of our net revenues from outside the united states 
international development  sales and operations are subject to a number of risks  including our ability to obtain or enforce our rights to the intellectual property developed by developers outside the united states  the time and costs associated with translating and localizing products for foreign markets  foreign currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including import and export control regulations  and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  or licensing to foreign entities 
any of these risks could adversely affect our costs  results of operations and financial condition 
we may face limitations on our ability to find suitable acquisition opportunities or to integrate any additional acquired businesses 
since january  we have added four product development studios in order to improve and increase our internal product development capabilities 
we intend to pursue additional acquisitions of companies  properties and other assets that can be purchased or licensed on acceptable terms and that we believe will benefit our business 
some of these transactions could be material in size and scope 
although we continue to search for additional acquisition opportunities  we may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition targets available at an acceptable price 
as the interactive entertainment software industry continues to consolidate  we face significant competition in seeking and consummating acquisition opportunities 
we may not be able to consummate potential acquisitions or an acquisition may not enhance our business or may decrease rather than increase our earnings 
in the future  we may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with one or more acquisitions  which may dilute our existing stockholders 
future acquisitions could also divert substantial management time and result in short term reductions in earnings or special transaction or other charges 
we may also be required to take significant charges related to acquisitions  including from in process research and development  reductions in force  facility reductions or other issues  which could harm our results of operations 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate the businesses that we may acquire into our existing business 
our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review  vote on or evaluate future acquisitions 
through their control of over of our outstanding common stock  sumner m 
redstone and his related parties decide the outcome of votes of our stockholders and are able to control our business strategies and policies 
as of march   sumner m 
redstone owns directly and indirectly through national amusements  inc nai and sumco  inc 
sumco for each of which he is the controlling stockholder  a total of  shares  or  of our outstanding common stock  based on his most recent report on form  as filed on february  mr 
redstone is chairman of the board and chief executive officer of nai 
nai is the parent company of viacom inc viacom 
mr 
redstone also is the chairman of the board of directors of viacom 
mr 
redstone may acquire additional shares of our common stock at any time 
mr 
redstone s spouse owns  shares of our common stock  for which mr 
redstone disclaims beneficial ownership 
through his ownership of our common stock  mr 
redstone controls the outcome of all corporate actions that require the approval of our stockholders  including the election of our directors  adoption of employee compensation plans and transactions involving a change of control 
mr 
redstone s daughter  shari e 
redstone  is the vice chairperson of our board of directors and the non executive vice chair of the board of directors of both viacom and cbs corporation cbs  an affiliate of viacom 
ms 
redstone also serves on the board of directors of nai  where she is also the president  and is president of sumco 
as president of each of nai and sumco  ms 
redstone has sole authority with respect to their investments in our company  including sole voting and investment power with respect to shares of our common stock 
see decisions by mr 
redstone and his related parties with respect to their ownership or trading of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and our convertible senior notes 
a member of our board of directors  joseph a 
califano  jr  also serves on the board of directors of cbs 
mr 
califano served on the viacom board of directors from until the split of viacom and cbs in another member of our board of directors  robert j 
steele  currently serves as vice president strategy and corporate development for nai 
in addition  mr 
redstone recommended the nomination of each member of our board of directors 
through his selection of and influence on members of our board of directors  mr 
redstone has the ability to control our business strategies and policies 
decisions by mr 
redstone and his related parties with respect to their ownership or trading of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and our convertible senior notes 
mr 
redstone and his related parties may or may not purchase additional shares of our common stock 
if mr 
redstone or his related parties purchase additional shares of our common stock  it could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock  which could negatively affect our common stock price and the value of the notes 
in the event beneficial ownership of mr 
redstone and his related parties equals or exceeds of the aggregate fair market value of our outstanding capital stock  calculated as described in the indentures for the notes  we may be forced to issue additional shares of our common stock to the holders of the notes upon their election to convert the notes 
alternatively  mr 
redstone or his related parties may sell some or all of their shares of our common stock at any time on the open market or otherwise 
the sale by mr 
redstone or his related parties of any of their shares of our common stock would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
mr 
redstone s or his related parties failure to purchase additional shares of our common stock in the open market could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
mr 
redstone or his related parties could also sell their controlling interest to a third party who may not agree with our business strategies and policies 
on december   mr 
redstone disclosed that he had transferred  or about  of his shares of our common stock to sumco  a corporation of which mr 
redstone indirectly owns a controlling interest 
in connection with that transfer  mr 
redstone and sumco entered into an agreement pursuant to which shari e 
redstone  as president of each of nai and sumco  would have sole voting and investment power over shares of our common stock held by nai and sumco  as well as sole authority with respect to all decisions relating to business and possible strategic decisions in which we are involved and may involve nai or sumco  in each case subject to the authority of their respective boards of directors 
under the agreement  provided that mr 
redstone is not buying or selling shares of our common stock  shari e 
redstone must consult with him on all material issues involving our company

redstone disclosed that he had sold an additional  or about half  of his remaining shares of our common stock to sumco 
mr 
redstone s total beneficial ownership of our common stock did not change as a result of this transaction 
in addition  in june  mr 
redstone reported that he engaged a financial advisor to provide services in connection with the evaluation of a possible going private or other transaction 
mr 
redstone has also reported that midway could be considered as a potential viacom acquisition candidate 
in  viacom established an ad hoc committee on electronic games to consider any proposed transactions or business arrangements between viacom and midway 
according to viacom s proxy statement for its annual meeting filed with the commission  it dissolved the ad hoc committee in connection with the separation of viacom and cbs on december  in addition  our board of directors has established a special independent committee  comprised of three independent directors who are disinterested with respect to matters relating to mr 
redstone and his affiliates  to consider any proposed transactions with mr 
redstone or any of his affiliates 
if mr 
redstone or his related parties consummates a going private transaction  it would constitute a fundamental change under the notes  triggering an increase in the conversion rate to the notes 
in addition  if mr 
redstone or his related parties sells or otherwise transfers their shares to a third party in a transaction that would constitute a change in control under the indentures to the notes  it would also constitute a fundamental change under the notes and the holders of these notes may require us to repurchase their notes upon such a fundamental change 
effects of anti takeover provisions could inhibit a change in control of midway and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our board of directors or management could use several charter or statutory provisions as anti takeover devices to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of midway 
the use of these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock blank check preferred stock our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences that may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors has broad power  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights superior to those of our common stock 
we currently have no shares of preferred stock outstanding and we have no current plans  agreements or commitments to issue any shares of preferred stock 
charter provisions our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that directors may be removed only for cause by a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of the stockholders by holders of shares of our common stock entitled to vote  any vacancy on our board of directors may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office  stockholders may not act by written consent  only the chairman or our board of directors by a majority vote may call special meetings of stockholders  and the only business permitted to be conducted at such special meetings is business brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors  stockholders must follow an advance notice procedure for the submission of director nominations and other business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders  either a majority vote of our board of directors or an affirmative vote of holders of at least of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote is needed in order to adopt  amend or repeal our bylaws  and either a majority vote of our board of directors or an affirmative vote of holders of at least of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote is needed in order to amend or repeal the above provisions 
section of the delaware general corporation law we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  this statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with anyone who owns at least of its common stock 
this prohibition lasts for a period of three years after that person has acquired the ownership 
the corporation may  however  engage in a business combination if it is approved by its board of directors before the person acquires the ownership or later by its board of directors and two thirds of the stockholders of the public corporation 
the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile due to certain factors  including  but not limited to  quarterly fluctuations in our financial and operating results  actions by our majority stockholder  our product development or release schedule  general conditions in the video game software  entertainment  media or electronics industries  timing of the introduction of new platforms and delays in the actual release of new platforms  or changes in earnings estimates 
shares available for future issuance  conversion and exercise could have an adverse effect on the earnings per share and the market price of our common stock 
any future issuance of equity securities  including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes or upon exercise of stock options  could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders  including holders who have received shares upon conversion of the notes  and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock and the notes 
as of march   we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock  and an additional million shares were reserved for future issuance under our stock option and incentive plans 
our stock options are generally exercisable for a period of nine years  beginning one year after the date of grant 
stock options are exercised  and the underlying common stock is generally sold  at a time when the exercise price of the options is below the market price of the common stock 
therefore  the exercise of these options generally has a dilutive effect on our common stock outstanding at the time of sale that could decrease our earnings per share 
exercises also may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
even the potential for the exercise of a large number of options with an exercise price significantly below the market price may depress the future market price of our common stock 
the notes are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock  at the holder s option  at the then applicable conversion price 
conversion of the notes generally will have a dilutive effect on our common stock outstanding at the time of conversion that could decrease our earnings per share and also may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has broad discretion with respect to the issuance of million authorized but unissued shares of common stock  million treasury shares and  authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock  subject to applicable new york stock exchange nyse rules and agreements with our lenders 
our board of directors may decide to issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons  including to finance our operations and business strategy  to adjust our ratio of debt to equity and to compensate our employees and executives 
the issuance or expected issuance of a large number of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the notes  exercise of the securities described above or the issuance of new securities could reduce significantly the earnings or loss per share of our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we have one operating segment  developing and publishing interactive entertainment software video games 
we sell video games for play on home consoles  handheld devices and pcs to mass merchandisers  video rental retailers  software specialty retailers  internet based retailers and entertainment software distributors 
we sell games primarily in north america  europe and australia for the major video game platforms and handheld devices  including sony s playstation ps and playstation portable psp  microsoft s xbox and xbox  nintendo s gamecube ngc  wii  game boy advance gba  and the nintendo ds ds  and also for pcs 
most of our video games currently have suggested retail prices on the initial release date in north america ranging from to for home console games  to for handheld games and to for pc games 
most of our video games currently have suggested retail prices on the initial release date in international markets ranging from to for home console games  to for handheld games and to for pc games 
we are currently developing games for all of the next generation of home console platforms  including sony s playstation ps  microsoft s xbox and nintendo s wii 
we released our first video games for the next generation of home console platforms in the fourth quarter of  including blitz the league for the xbox and a number of children s titles for the nintendo wii 
we have not yet released any video games for the ps we expect retail price ranges for our frontline next generation video games on the initial release date to increase from those for our current generation platform releases 
additionally  we earn license and royalty revenue from licensing the rights to some of our video games and intellectual property to third parties 
we have experienced annual operating losses since our fiscal year ended june  in order to address this issue  we refocused our product strategy as we entered the current home console transition period in an effort to return to profitability 
our current product strategy includes the following i build games that leverage our proven intellectual properties and franchises  ii build over the top sports games  iii continue to develop appealing games for mature gamers  iv expand our game development in the pc and children s market to help us bridge through the console transition  and v gain market share in the next generation home console cycle with the development of high potential ambitious  mass market next generation games 
prime examples of the first three are the releases of mortal kombat armageddon  the final sequel from our top selling mortal kombat franchise on the current generation home consoles  and nba ballers phenom and nba ballers rebound  the latest sequels to our nba licensed basketball franchise that features one on one and two on two gameplay both on and off the court compared to the standard team play provided in competitor titles 
we increased our focus on the development of pc games with our release of four titles for the pc in and six more titles in we also re entered the children s game market in and released a number of licensed children s titles through the end of finally  we believe that the more ambitious  mass market next generation games will continue to be very successful as the next generation consoles become more established in the market 
these games offer consumers increased playability and multiple experiences within a single video game  such as driving  fighting and shooting 
these types of games became increasingly popular in the current home console cycle  and we expect this trend to continue with the more advanced hardware in the next generation home console platforms 
we have invested significant resources into the development of these types of games and expect to release the first of these for next generation consoles in we continue to focus our product development and marketing resources to build higher quality games with substantial marketing support 
we are attempting to structure our product release schedules and product launch timing to best position our products against our competition 
we also are focused on pre launch awareness and visibility of our games with consumers through increased media advertising and retail marketing 
we have completed several financing transactions in recent years to support and execute our refocused strategy 
in september  we completed a private placement of million of convertible senior notes  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
we also completed a second private placement of million of convertible senior notes in may which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds of both financing transactions are being used for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
new platform cycle  recent trends and uncertainties our revenues and results of operations could be negatively impacted by the ongoing home console transition period  decreasing selling prices of our video games developed for the older generation of platforms  and increased development costs for video games developed for the next generation home consoles 
new platform cycle the current generation of game platforms includes the following home consoles the ps  released in  and the gamecube and the xbox  each released in historically  a new generation of more technologically advanced game consoles has reached the market approximately every four to six years 
at the beginning of each new generation  or cycle  during the period of rapid growth in the installed base of the new generation of consoles  software sales for the new consoles have historically experienced periods of rapid expansion  as an increasing number of new console owners purchase video games for the new consoles 
the time period referred to by the industry as the home console transition period is roughly defined as the time period from the first announcement of the introduction of the first of the new generation of home game consoles until these new consoles supplant the older generation consoles in terms of software sales 
microsoft launched the first next generation home console platform  xbox  in november in the us and december in europe 
nintendo released their next generation home console platform  the wii  in november in the us and then in europe and japan in december sony also released their next generation home console platform  the ps  in november in both the us and japan 
sony is expected to release the ps in europe in march we are currently developing video games for all of these new platforms 
as we continue through the home console transition period  we expect our future revenues and operating results could continue to be negatively impacted 
see item a 
risk factors if consumers discontinue purchasing our products for current generation home consoles or the prices for our current generation products further decrease as a result of the current home console transition period  our revenues and margins would be adversely affected for further discussion 
decreasing revenues and selling prices at the end of each cycle  when the introduction of a new generation of home game consoles is announced  net revenues related to the older generation of platforms and games generally diminish  as consumers defer and decrease purchases in anticipation of the new platforms and games  and video game developers lower prices on games for the older generation of platforms 
our net revenues for increased compared to net revenues for due primarily to an increase in the total number of video games we released in compared to and a increase in the number of units sold 
however  our per unit net selling price decreased from to due largely to the ongoing home console transition period 
industry wide north american retail unit and dollar sales continued to decline for the current generation of home consoles and related software during all of compared to we expect this trend to continue and our future revenues could continue to be negatively affected until we begin to release more video games for the next generation consoles and the completion of the home console transition period 
for the second  third and fourth quarters of  total industry wide north american retail unit and dollar sales for software on all consoles  both current and next generation combined  have increased over the same quarters in as more next generation consoles reach the marketplace and spending on next generation products increases 
increasing costs to develop video games video games have become increasingly more expensive to produce as the platforms on which they are played continue to advance technologically  and consumers demand continual improvements in the overall game play experience 
we believe our strategy of growing our internal product development resources will facilitate an efficient cost structure for development of video games for the next generation of consoles because we will be able to share and reuse as opposed to recreating technologies and developed assets across our internal studios 
however  we expect that video games for the next generation of consoles will be more costly and take longer to develop 
specifically  we expect the development cycle for video games for the next generation of consoles to range from to months  compared to the development cycle for games on the current generation of consoles of to months 
we expect our costs related to developing titles on the next generation of consoles will generally range between million to million per title  which represents a substantial increase in costs incurred to develop current generation titles  which have ranged from million to million 
handheld market in november  nintendo launched a dual screened  portable game system  the ds 
sony also entered the handheld market with the introduction of the psp 
the psp was released in japan in december  in the united states in march and in europe in september we released our first games for the psp and ds in the fourth quarter of and fourth quarter of  respectively 
we have devoted more resources toward the handheld market as it continues to become a larger part of the video game industry in recent years 
pc market we generated increased revenues from games played on the pc in recent years and anticipate revenues from pc titles to increase in the future 
we launched rise fall civilizations at war in the second quarter of along with a number of additional titles throughout the year 
our future releases will include our previously announced agreement to publish the lord of the rings online shadows of angmar in north america and unreal tournament iii  both scheduled for release in  along with additional scheduled releases of pc titles in and beyond 
children s market during  we signed publishing agreements with warner bros 
interactive entertainment  licensing several properties to develop video games based on both television programs and films in the children s market 
these agreements are multi territory arrangements that include games for console  handheld and pc platforms 
video game sales for the children s market had historically performed well  particularly on the older video game consoles and the handheld platforms  during a console transition period 
we released the first title under these agreements  ed  edd n eddy  in the fourth quarter of in  we released three more titles under these agreements the ant bully  the grim adventures of billy mandy and happy feet 
strategic alliances during  we announced a strategic relationship with mtv networks to jointly market three video game titles and collaborate on soundtrack development for two of these titles 
la rush  released in the fourth quarter of on the ps and xbox  was the first of the three titles to be released under the relationship 
the second title under the mtv alliance  the wheelman  featuring the talents of vin diesel  is currently under development 
this alliance with mtv is expected to help increase the overall marketing reach and exposure of our titles released under the agreement 
mtv is a subsidiary of viacom inc our largest stockholder  sumner m 
redstone  serves as executive chairman of the board of directors of viacom and is the chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of national amusements  inc nai

the lord of the rings online  scheduled to be released in the first half of  is the world s first and only massively multiplayer online mmo role playing game based upon the literary works of jrr tolkien 
also  in february  we announced the broadening of our in game advertising strategy and executed a multi year  multi game agreement with double fusion inc to provide dynamic  in game advertising in future titles 
we expect to work together with double fusion to integrate advertising campaigns into multiple next generation titles 
this agreement is expected to generate incremental revenue in addition to revenue from our existing static advertising placement strategy 
under this agreement  certain of our titles are slated to incorporate double fusion s dynamic ad serving technology to serve advertising campaigns which will be sold by double fusion s worldwide sales force 
expansion of product development resources we are focused on building our product pipeline to achieve the necessary size and scale to succeed in the next home console cycle 
we expect to continue to increase our investment in product development  which we anticipate may include substantial headcount growth and further acquisitions of external development studios 
we anticipate that these activities will increase both revenues and operating costs in future periods 
issuance of convertible senior notes during september  we completed the private placement of million of convertible senior notes due the notes resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
during may  we completed our second private placement of million of convertible senior notes due the notes  together with the notes  the notes resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
we also intend to use the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund future acquisitions of  or strategic alliances with  development companies or other companies involved in the development  production or sales of videogames

total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated and actual forfeitures

these awards could result in a maximum of  of compensation expense in future periods should the maximum performance conditions be achieved 
such compensation expense  if any  could be recognized during the period from january through march recognition of this expense in future periods is dependent upon the assessment as to whether the achievement of the performance conditions is deemed probable at the end of each reporting period

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to our business operations 
the interpretation of these policies requires management judgments and estimates of matters which ultimately may differ from actual results 
for a discussion of other significant accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the software is delivered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the customer receivable is probable 
we do not provide any significant customization of software or postcontract customer support 
if consumer demand for a product falls below expectations  we often grant price protection to spur further sales and sometimes accept product returns 
therefore  revenue is recorded net of an allowance for price protection  returns and discounts 
price protection  returns and discounts we grant price protection or discounts to  and sometimes allow product returns from  our customers 
therefore  we record an allowance for price protection  returns and discounts at each balance sheet date 
price protection means credits relating to retail price markdowns on our products previously sold by us to customers 
we base these allowances on expected trends and estimates of potential future price protection  product returns and discounts related to current period product revenue 
several factors are used in developing these estimates  including a prior experience with price protection  returns and discounts  b historical and expected sell through rates for particular games  c historical and expected rates of requests for such credits  d specific identification of problem accounts  e existing field inventories  f shipments by geography as price protection  returns and discounts experience differs by geography  g terms of sale  h sales rates or trends for similar products  i consideration of price points that would encourage future sell through at the retail level and corresponding price protection credits that would be granted to appropriate customers  j the net price paid by our customers for products on which previous price protection has been granted and k other relevant factors 
sell through refers to consumer purchases of our product at retail from our customers 
actual price protection  product returns and discounts may materially differ from our estimates as our products are subject to changes in consumer preferences  technological obsolescence due to new platforms or competing products 
changes in these factors could change our judgments and estimates and result in variances in the amount of allowance required 
this may impact the amount and timing of our revenue for any period 
for example  if customers request price protection in amounts exceeding the rate expected and if management agrees to grant it  then we may incur additional charges 
during  and  we recorded provisions for price protection  returns and discounts of   and  respectively 
such amounts are reflected as a reduction of revenues 
our accounts receivable balance is reported net of an allowance for estimated future price protection and discounts to be issued and estimated future product returns to be accepted from sales made prior to the balance sheet date 
at december  and  our allowances for price protection  returns and discounts were  and  respectively 
we believe these allowances are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of future price protection  returns and discounts 
doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
we analyze significant customer accounts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  we may record allowances for doubtful accounts related to customers based on length of time the receivable balance is outstanding  financial health of the customer and historical experience 
this analysis requires management to make estimates of collectibility which may materially differ from actual collections 
if circumstances related to our customers change  the amount and timing of bad debt expense for any period may be impacted 
during and  we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
during  we recorded a  gain related to partial collection of customer accounts previously written off  net of current year provisions 
such amounts are included in administrative expense 
our accounts receivable balance is reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts from sales made prior to the balance sheet date 
at december  and  our allowances for doubtful accounts were  and  respectively 
we believe this allowance is adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of doubtful accounts 
capitalized product development costs our capitalized product development costs consist of software development costs for video games that will be sold 
we account for software development in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed by us when incurred and are included in research and development expense 
once a software product has reached technological feasibility  all subsequent software development costs for that product are capitalized until that product is released for sale 
technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis and can occur early in the development cycle or later depending on required technology to complete the product and the availability of such technology to us 
after a product is released for sale  the capitalized product development costs are amortized to expense based on the ratio of actual cumulative revenues to the total of actual cumulative revenues plus projected future revenues for each game 
this expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales 
we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a product by product basis 
capitalized costs for products that are cancelled are expensed in the period of cancellation 
in addition  a charge to cost of sales is recorded when our forecast for a particular game indicates that unamortized capitalized costs exceed the estimated future net realizable value of that asset 
the estimated future net realizable value is the estimated future revenues from that game reduced by the estimated future cost of completing and selling the game 
if a revised game sales forecast is less than management s current game sales forecast  or if actual game sales are less than management s forecast  it is possible we could accelerate the amortization of software development costs previously capitalized 
as a result  the forecasted sales for a given game are a sensitive factor in this calculation 
critical factors evaluated in estimating forecasted sales include  among other things historical sales of similar titles  pre launch awareness  game ratings from publications and websites  current demand and sell through rates 
management judgments and estimates are used in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and in the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized costs 
different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts of capitalized product development costs  research and development expense or cost of sales 
during  and  we recorded capitalized product development cost impairment charges in cost of sales and  where appropriate  restructuring and other charges of   and  respectively 
our capitalized product development costs at december  and were  and  respectively 
we believe our capitalized product development costs balance at december  is recoverable from future revenue activity 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we use october as our annual measurement date and use market capitalization as an initial indicator of our fair value 
we completed our annual impairment test on october  and found no indicators of impairment of goodwill 
as a result  we did not recognize an impairment loss 
the carrying amount of goodwill at december  and was  and  respectively 
future goodwill impairment tests may result in a material charge to earnings if  for example  our enterprise fair value falls below our net book value 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount we expect to realize in future periods 
our deferred tax assets result primarily from tax loss carryforwards 
the amount of tax loss carryforward expected to be used within the carryforward period is limited to sources of future taxable income that are more likely than not to be generated within the carryforward period 
the valuation allowance recorded is a reduction to the deferred tax asset  with a corresponding charge to the statement of operations 
in the event we determine that we will realize our deferred tax asset in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an increase to the net deferred tax asset would be recorded in the period such determination was made 
generating taxable income in subsequent periods and changes in estimates of future taxable income could affect the amounts of the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
at december  and  we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
stockholder ownership change s  as defined under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  may limit the annual amount of net operating loss carryforward we may use to offset future taxable income

liquidity and capital resources our principal source of operating cash is from the distribution and sale of our video games 
in each of and  we completed a million convertible senior note issuance to strengthen our cash position 
our principal uses of cash are for payments associated with both internal and third party developers of our software  manufacturers of our video game inventory  royalties to video game platform manufacturers and intellectual property owners  costs incurred to sell and market our video games and administrative expenses 
as of december   our primary source of liquidity was  of cash and cash equivalents  compared with  at december  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was impacted by the following financing cash inflows that occurred during the year then ended  from the issuance of convertible senior notes and  of cash received from common stock option exercises 
these inflows from financing activities were offset by a net  usage of cash to fund operating activities 
our working capital at december  totaled  compared with  at december  our overall business strategy depends on generating revenue from new products 
if our new products fail to gain market acceptance  we may not have sufficient revenues to pay our expenses and to develop a continuous stream of new games 
we actively manage our capital structure and balance sheet as a component of our overall business strategy 
since january  we have acquired four privately held software developers principally through the issuance of shares of our common stock 
we may issue additional shares of common stock  and use our cash and cash equivalents  if we identify an opportunity to acquire businesses that will further strengthen our internal product development teams and our ability to create high quality games  or that will further strengthen our distribution capabilities 
we may also pursue additional debt or equity financing in the future to raise additional working capital or to pay our long term obligations  alleviating cash use requirements 
during the year ended december   gross receivables  excluding the impact of receivables provisions  increased by  due to sales for the period exceeding cash collections and credits granted to customers 
this was primarily attributable to the significant increase in net revenues during the fourth quarter of  compared to net revenues in the fourth quarter of 
we also invested  in property and equipment during the year ended december   relating primarily to computer equipment and software used to develop video games for the next generation home consoles 
gross receivables  excluding the impact of receivables provisions  increased by  during the year ended december  due to sales for the period exceeding cash collections and credits granted to customers 
accounts payable and accruals increased from the beginning of the period by a net  due to costs incurred in relation to our titles released in the fourth quarter of and in development at year end  including marketing and advertising costs incurred  as well as amounts owed for inventory and distribution costs and third party development milestones 
we also invested  in property and equipment during the year ended december   relating primarily to computer equipment and software used to develop video games 
management believes that our cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  of  along with additional availability under the bank financing secured in march see below  will be adequate to fund the anticipated levels of inventories  receivables and other working capital requirements for the operation of our business and our other presently anticipated needs through therefore  we believe we will not need to raise additional debt or equity financing during  however  we will assess opportunities should market conditions appear favorable 
in may  we completed a private placement of million of convertible senior notes due notes  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the convertible senior notes bear interest at per annum and are payable semi annually on november and may of each year  beginning november  the holders of the notes could initially convert the notes into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the maturity date or redemption at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  which represented an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
effective june   the conversion rate was adjusted so that the conversion price was adjusted to per share of common stock 
the conversion rate of the notes may further increase based upon certain circumstances or events 
also  the earliest date the holders may require us to settle the convertible senior notes in cash is may  the terms of the notes limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and perform certain other business activities  as more fully described in item a

at december   we had  available for borrowings under the line of credit 
the term loan can be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty 
if the credit facility is terminated before the maturity date of march   the lender is entitled to receive prepayment penalties not to exceed  in addition  management has the ability  if necessary  to implement additional restructuring activities that would substantially reduce personnel and personnel related costs  reduce capital expenditures  reduce research and development expenditures and or reduce selling and marketing expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we lease various office facilities  a warehouse and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
additionally  we enter into license agreements for the use of intellectual property used in specific video games or for a period of time 
some of these agreements provide for advance payments or guarantee minimum payments of royalties  as well as committing to spend a minimum level of future marketing expenditures for the respective video games 
we also enter into arrangements with third parties to develop some of our video games

such cancellations could result in amounts owed being less than those reflected above

impact of inflation in recent years  the level of inflation affecting us has been relatively low 
our ability to pass on future cost increases in the form of higher sales prices will continue to be dependent on the prevailing competitive environment and the acceptance of our products in the marketplace 
seasonality the video game industry is highly seasonal and has generally experienced higher revenues in the quarter ended december due to customer purchases preceding the year end retail holiday selling season 
significant working capital is required to finance high levels of inventories and accounts receivable during that quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december  and  we had no investments with maturity dates greater than days 
at december   we had a balance of  outstanding under the credit facility entered into during march this facility is based on variable interest rates and bore interest at the bank s base rate at december  
changes in market rates may impact the bank s base rate 
for example  if the bank s base rate were to increase or decrease one percentage point  our expected interest expense would change by approximately  our convertible senior notes bear interest at fixed rates and therefore interest expense associated with the convertible senior notes will not be impacted by fluctuations in market interest rates 
fluctuations in market interest rates  however  may impact investors decisions whether to continue to hold the convertible senior notes  redeem them or convert them into common stock 
the holders of notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on each of april   september   september  and september  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
the holders of our notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on each of may   may  and may  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
we do not believe that interest rate risk is significant to us at december  foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound gbp and the euro  which results in the recognition of foreign currency transaction gains or losses
