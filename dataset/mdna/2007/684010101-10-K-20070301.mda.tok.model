cash flow cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in cash provided by operating activities was the increase in our net income in  and the increase in our overall cash balances associated with becoming self clearing 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in investing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  there are certain customer activities that may result in contingencies that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities may expose us to off balance sheet credit risk in the event the customers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations 
many of our customer accounts are margin accounts 
in margin transactions  we may be obligated for credit extended to our customers by our clearing firms  subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements 
see risk factors we are subject to various forms of credit risk  and those risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial situation for a more detailed discussion of this risks associated with these arrangements 

table of contents summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the accounting policy that has a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and requires management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment relates to the capitalization of software development 
software costs associated with software developed for internal use include capitalized costs based on sop and other related guidance 
capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software and payroll for employees directly associated with  and who devote time to  the development of the internal use software 
costs incurred in development and enhancement of the software that do not meet the capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred 
these capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
during  and  we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of software development costs 
in addition  during   and  we expensed million  million and million for costs associated with software that did not meet the capitalization criteria 
the critical estimate related to this process is the determination of the amount of time devoted by employees to specific stages of internal use software development projects 
we utilize a project management tool to assist in validating the underlying estimates used in the determination of time devoted 
we review for any impairment of the capitalized costs on a periodic basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
we do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we do not have material exposure to commodity price changes  foreign currency fluctuations or similar market risks other than the effect they may have on trading volumes 
accordingly  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to mitigate such risks 
in addition  we do not trade securities for our own account or maintain inventories of securities for sale  and therefore are not subject to equity price risk 
our revenues and financial instruments are denominated in us dollars  and we do not invest in derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk as a self clearing broker dealer  we hold interest earning assets  mainly customer funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations 
interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities in the form of customer cash balances 
we earn a net interest spread on the customer balances  as well as on the difference between amounts earned on customer margin loans and amounts paid on customer cash balances 
since we set the rate paid on customer cash balances and the rate charged on customer margin loans  we are able to manage a substantial portion of our interest rate risk 
however  a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread while a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread 
we estimate that as of december   an immediate one hundred basis point increase or decrease in short term interest rates would result in approximately million more or less annual pre tax income  respectively 
changes in interest rates also affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
to reduce this interest rate risk  we are currently invested in investments with short maturities 
credit risk we extend margin credit and leverage to our customers  which is subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements 
margin credit is collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
leverage involves securing a large potential future obligation with a proportional amount of cash or securities 
the risks associated with margin credit and leverage increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where leverage or collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit or leverage and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover 
table of contents their obligations in the event of a liquidation 
we are also exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities  which can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
we expect this kind of exposure to increase with growth in our overall business 
because the losses associated with margin accounts can exceed the amount of the margin loans reflected on our balance sheet  we may be exposed to significant off balance sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers fail to satisfy their obligations 
as of december   we had million in margin credit extended to our customers 
the amount of risk to which we are exposed from the leverage we extend to our customers and from short sale transactions by our customers is unlimited and not quantifiable as the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices 
our account level margin credit and leverage requirements meet or exceed those required by regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve 
we have a comprehensive policy implemented in accordance with sro standards to assess and monitor the suitability of investors to engage in various trading activities 
to mitigate our risk  we also continuously monitor customer accounts to detect excessive concentration  large orders or positions  patterns of day trading and other activities that indicate increased risk to us
