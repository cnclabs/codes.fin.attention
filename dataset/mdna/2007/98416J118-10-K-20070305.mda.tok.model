overview we are a leading global manufacturer and supplier of two types of consumable products used primarily in the production of paper clothing and roll covers 
our operations are strategically located in the major paper producing regions of north america  europe  south america and asia pacific 
our products play key roles in the formation and processing of paper along the length of a paper making machine 
paper producers rely on our products and services to help improve the quality of their paper  differentiate their paper products  operate their paper making machines more efficiently and reduce production costs 
our products and services typically represent only a small fraction of a paper producer s overall production costs  yet they reduce costs by permitting the use of lower cost raw materials and reducing energy consumption 
paper producers must replace clothing and refurbish or replace roll covers regularly as these products wear down during the paper production process 
our products are designed to withstand extreme temperature  chemical and pressure conditions  and are the result of a substantial investment in research and development and highly sophisticated manufacturing processes 
we operate in two principal business segments clothing and roll covers 
in our clothing segment  we manufacture and sell highly engineered synthetic textile belts that transport paper as it is processed on a paper making machine 
clothing plays a significant role in the forming  pressing and drying stages of paper production 
because paper making processes and machine specifications vary widely  the clothing size  form  material and function is selected to fit each individual paper making machine and process 
in  our clothing segment represented of our net sales 
our roll cover products provide a surface with the mechanical properties necessary to process the paper sheet in a cost effective manner that delivers the sheet qualities desired by the paper producer 
roll covers are tailored to each individual paper making machine and process  using different materials  treatments and finishings 
in addition to manufacturing and selling new roll covers  we also provide refurbishment services for previously installed roll covers and manufacture spreader rolls 
in  our roll cover segment represented of our net sales 
in  sales in other industrial applications outside of the paper industry  such as steel  plastics and textiles  accounted for of the net sales in each of our segments 
industry trends and outlook demand for our products depends primarily on the volume of paper produced on a worldwide basis 
the profitability of paper producers has historically been highly cyclical due to wide swings in the price of paper  driven to a high degree by the oversupply of paper during periods when paper producers have more aggregate capacity than the market requires 
a sustained downturn in the paper industry  either globally or in a particular region  can cause paper manufacturers to reduce production or cease operations  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
paper producers began in to take actions that seek to structurally improve the balance between the supply of and demand for paper 
as part of these efforts  they have shut down many paper making machines 
between and the bulk of these closures occurred in north america and announcements by paper producers for shutdowns of paper making machines in north america have continued  although at a reduced level compared to through in and  there was an increase in the number of planned shutdowns of paper making machines in europe  although not at the level experienced in 
table of contents recent years in north america 
during and  the sales and profitability of our north american and european operations were adversely affected by these shutdowns 
papermakers continue to experience low levels of profitability  and we believe that further consolidation among papermakers  reducing the number of paper producers  and shutdowns of paper making machines will occur in europe and north america  until there is a better balance between supply and demand for paper and the profit levels of paper producers improve 
the balance between supply and demand is expected to improve as the industry consolidates further and shuts down excess capacity 
in addition  consumption growth of paper is expected to drive an increase in the production rates required to maintain balance between supply and demand 
according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations  the volume of paper productions between and increased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately from to jaako p yry consulting expects the growth of global paper production from to to slow down to an average of slightly less than per annum 
we expect growth to be greater in asia  south america and eastern europe than in the more mature north american and western european regions 
given that demand for our products is primarily driven by the level of global paper production  we expect that demand for our products will grow in a manner consistent with these trends but be moderated by the level of industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity in north america and western europe 
we expect to increase our footprint in asia in order to take advantage of the high growth potential in that region 
we anticipate that pricing pressure for our products  roll covers in particular  will continue to escalate with the consolidation among paper producers and as the shift of paper production growth in asia develops 
in response to this pricing pressure  we expect to increase our expenditure levels on research and development expenses and continue to develop our value added selling approach as part of our strategy to differentiate our products 
sales and expenses sales in both our clothing and roll covers segments are primarily driven by the following factors the volume of worldwide paper production  advances in the technology of our products  which can provide value to our customers by improving the efficiency of paper making machines  and our ability to provide products and services which reduce paper making machine downtime  while at the same time allowing the manufacture of high quality paper products 
sales in our roll covers segment include our mechanical services business 
we have expanded this business in response to demand from paper producers that we perform work on the internal mechanisms of a roll while we refurbish or replace a roll cover 
in our clothing segment  a small portion of our business has been conducted pursuant to consignment arrangements under which we do not recognize a sale of a product to a customer until the customer places the product into use  which typically occurs some period after the product is shipped to the customer or to a warehouse location near the customer s facility 
recently  we have been reducing the number of consignment arrangements and increasing the use of standard terms of sale under which we recognize a sale upon product shipment 
we expect this trend to continue  although at a slower pace than in key factors affecting our costs include our total sales volume which directly impacts the level of our cost of products sold and production capacity utilization  the amount of our property and equipment depreciation  and the level of our research and development spending 
the level of our cost of products sold is primarily attributable to labor costs  raw material costs  product shipping costs  plant utilization and depreciation  with labor costs constituting the largest component 

table of contents the amount of depreciation on our property and equipment reflects the level of our capital expenditures 
we invest in facilities and equipment that enable innovative product development and improve production efficiency and costs 
recent examples of capital spending for such purposes include faster weaving looms and seaming machines with accurate electronic controls  automated compound mixing equipment and computer controlled lathes and mills 
the level of research and development spending is driven by market demand for technology enhancements  including both specific customer needs and general market requirements  as well as by our own analysis of applied technology opportunities 
with the exception of purchases of equipment and similar capital items used in our research and development activities  all research and development is expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that future research and development expenses  as compared to these levels  will increase based on an increased focus on advanced research 
foreign exchange we have a geographically diverse customer base 
in  approximately of our sales were in north america  were in europe  were in south america  were in asia pacific and were in the rest of the world 
a substantial portion of our sales is denominated in euros or other currencies 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies affect our reported levels of revenues and profitability as the results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
in particular  increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the euro and these other currencies adversely impact our levels of revenue and profitability because the translation of a certain number of euros or units of such other currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes will represent fewer us dollars 
for certain transactions  our sales are denominated in us dollars or euros but all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in a different currency 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies can affect the level of the profitability of these transactions 
the largest proportion of such transactions consist of transactions in which the sales are denominated in us dollars and all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in euros or other currencies 
currency fluctuations have a greater effect on the level of our net sales than on the level of our income loss from operations 
for example  in as compared to  the change in the value of the us dollar against the currencies we conduct our business in resulted in currency translation increases in net sales and income from operations of million and million  respectively 
although the results reflect a period in which the value of the us dollar decreased as compared to  we would expect a similar but opposite effect in a period in which the value of the us dollar increases 
for any period in which the value of the us dollar changes relative to other currencies  we would expect our income loss from operations to be proportionately affected less than our net sales 

table of contents during  we conducted business in foreign currencies 
the following table provides the average exchange rate in and of the us dollar against each of the five foreign currencies in which we conduct the largest portion of our operations  and indicates the percentage of our net sales in and denominated in each such foreign currency 
currency average exchange rate of the us dollar in average exchange rate of the us dollar in euro euro euro canadian dollar canadian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real brazilian real brazilian real australian dollar australian dollar australian dollar british pound british pound british pound currency percentage of net sales denominated in such currency percentage of net sales denominated in such currency euro canadian dollar brazilian real australian dollar british pound to mitigate the risk of transactions in which a sale is made in one currency and associated costs are denominated in a different currency  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain that results from the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedge strategy 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
any cash dividends on our common stock will be paid in us dollars 
we do not expect to generate sufficient cash flows denominated in us dollars to make our anticipated dividend payments and will therefore rely  in part  on the conversion to us dollars of cash flows generated in other currencies 
the amount of us dollars received from the conversion of cash flows generated in other currencies will depend on the then current exchange rates 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the value of these other currencies  the cash flows will represent fewer us dollars 
as a result  even if our results of operations meet our expectations in local currencies and we are permitted to pay dividends under our credit facility  we may not have sufficient cash to pay such dividends 
cost reduction programs an important part of our strategy is to seek to reduce our overall costs and improve our competitiveness 
as a part of this effort  we have engaged in a series of cost reduction programs since  which were designed to improve the cost structure of our operations in north america  south america and europe  in response to changing market conditions 
these cost reduction programs include headcount reductions throughout the world as well as plant closures that have rationalized production among our facilities to better enable us to meet customer demands 
our cost reduction efforts between and included the closing of eight manufacturing facilities and the movement of certain production from two other facilities 
four facilities were closed in the clothing segment  of which three were in north america and one was in the united kingdom and we closed four facilities in the 
table of contents rolls segment  three were in north america and one was in the united kingdom 
from to  we eliminated approximately positions in connection with our cost reduction efforts 
as a result of these actions  offset by other changes in workforce  our headcount decreased by approximately positions during that period 
during    and  we expensed   impairment   impairment    impairment   impairment and  respectively  for these restructuring programs 
these cost reduction efforts since eliminated approximately million in cash costs that we would have otherwise incurred in as compared to our cost structure in  an additional million in cash costs that would have otherwise incurred in as compared to our cost structure in and an additional million in cash costs that would have otherwise incurred in as compared to our cost structure in we experienced added operating costs resulting from shifting production from north american closed facilities to other facilities in these restructuring programs which adversely impacted our cost of sales by approximately million and million in and  respectively  and in the last quarter of  we experienced added operating costs of million in a european facility due to shifting production from a closed facility  which costs we expect to decrease in in the third quarter  we announced the reorganization of our european management structure along functional lines and have recorded related restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december  we have substantially completed the major restructuring programs that have already been initiated both in roll covers and clothing in and prior and do not currently anticipate significant plant closures of the type we completed in through we believe that our manufacturing footprint for clothing in north america has been adequately consolidated and that potential exists to improve our fixed overhead structure and to initiate further consolidations of our rolls manufacturing footprint in europe and north america 
we have entered into discussions with the workforce representatives regarding the potential closure of a small roll covers plant in the uk in we recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of related to this facility 
we also expect to implement cost reduction programs in designed to improve our fixed overhead structure  and we expect to incur significant restructuring expenses in in connection with our presently contemplated cost reduction efforts 
in addition  we have also initiated lean manufacturing and procurement initiatives designed to enhance the efficiency of our manufacturing process  which we believe will help offset the effect of inflation on our bottom line following the initial investments required for these initiatives 
there can be no assurance that our cost reduction programs will be successful 
while our cost reduction programs are designed to help mitigate the effect of increases in our operating costs  we may experience sales or cost changes from period to period which have a greater effect on the level of our profitability than savings derived from our cost reduction programs

net sales for increased by million  or  to million from million for in  of our net sales were in our clothing segment and were in our roll cover segment 
in our clothing segment  net sales for increased by million  or  to million from million for primarily due to i favorable currency effects on net sales in our clothing segment of million related to the translation of sales made in currencies other than the us dollar to us dollars for financial reporting purposes and ii increased sales from our asia pacific operations  including increased sales 
table of contents of million resulting from the operations of pma shoji co 
ltd  which we purchased in the third quarter of offsetting these increases were i unfavorable currency effects on pricing related to sales prices indexed in us dollars by certain us operations of million and ii a reduction of million in clothing equipment sales during as compared with overall pricing levels in our clothing segment decreased marginally during as compared with in our roll covers segment  net sales for increased by million  or  to million from million for principally due to increased sales volume  primarily in north america  including million of net sales attributable to the operations of coldwater covers  inc  which we acquired in february  and to favorable currency effects of million related to the translation of sales made in currencies other than the us dollar to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
overall pricing levels in our rolls segment decreased marginally during as compared with cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for increased million  or  to million from million for in our clothing segment  cost of products sold for decreased by million  or  to million from million for the decrease was primarily due to i the million impact of a lower cost structure for as compared to our cost structure for resulting from our cost reduction programs  ii decreased added operating costs of million as compared with due to shifting production from closed facilities to other facilities under our restructuring programs and iii lower overall sales in this segment 
these decreases were offset by unfavorable currency effects of million related to the translation of costs incurred in currencies other than the us dollar to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
in our roll covers segment  cost of products sold increased by million  or  to million from million for the increase was primarily attributable to i increased sales in this segment  ii an unfavorable shift in the mix of our product sales to lower margin products  primarily in north america  during as compared to  and iii unfavorable currency effects of million related to the translation of costs incurred in currencies other than the us dollar to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
the unfavorable product mix resulted from a shift in sales from our more profitable rubber covers to other types of covers as well as increased sales in mechanical services and spreader rolls  which carry lower margins than our roll covers 
these increases were partially offset by the million favorable impact of a lower cost structure for as compared to our cost structure for resulting from our cost reduction programs 
selling expenses 
for  selling expenses increased by million  or  to million from million for primarily due to i unfavorable currency effects of million related to the translation of costs incurred in currencies other than the us dollar to us dollars for financial reporting purposes and ii increased payroll  commissions and other selling expenses to expand sales coverage and to address shifting markets 
general and administrative expenses 
for  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million for the decrease was primarily due to million of expenses incurred in connection with the closing of our initial public offering on may  and related transactions 
additionally  general and administrative expenses decreased by the million impact of a lower cost structure for as compared to our cost structure for resulting from our cost reduction programs 
these decreases were partially offset by i an increase of million in our environmental expense in as compared to due to the discovery of additional contaminated soil at a former manufacturing site during the company s remediation efforts undertaken in the fourth quarter of that related to the removal of contaminated soil previously identified by the company see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  ii a million decrease in royalty income due to a receipt of royalties in resulting from the final settlement of certain royalties that did not recur in  iii a million increase in compensation expense incurred in as compared with as a result of restricted stock units granted under our 
table of contents equity incentive plan  iv an increase in bad debt expense of million during as compared to the  v unfavorable currency effects of million and vi increased payroll  fringe benefits and other costs related to business development and reorganization activities in as compared to restructuring and impairments expenses 
for  restructuring and impairments expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million during restructuring and impairments expenses result from our long term strategy to reduce costs and improve long term competitiveness as described above under cost reduction programs by closing and or transferring production from certain of our manufacturing facilities and through headcount reductions 
expenses incurred in include severance  facility and asset impairment costs of million  million  and million  respectively 
restructuring and impairments expenses incurred in were primarily severance related costs resulting from the reorganization of our european management structure along functional lines and to the impairment of assets related to a facility for which a closing was announced in for  restructuring and impairments expenses consist of severance  facility  and asset impairment costs of million  million  and million  respectively 
research and development expenses 
for  research and development remained relatively constant at million for as compared with million for interest expense  net 
net interest expense for decreased by million  or  to million from million for the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances outstanding during as compared with as a result of the refinancing that occurred in connection with our initial public offering on may   and to lower interest rates on our current credit facility as compared to our debt facilities prior to the initial public offering 
foreign exchange gain loss 
for  we had a foreign exchange loss of million compared to a foreign exchange gain of million for this million difference was primarily attributable to the manner in which swings in the value of the us dollar as compared to other currencies  primarily the euro and the brazilian real  affected certain intercompany transactions and  up until may   the reported amount of our external debt 
under our previously existing senior and mezzanine debt facilities  certain of our subsidiaries had debt denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and  as a result  the changes in relative exchange rates created a foreign exchange gain or loss 
under our current credit facility  the majority of amounts borrowed are denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary  which mitigates the amount of foreign exchange gain or loss related to external debt 
foreign exchange gains and losses since may  resulted primarily from intercompany activity 
provision for income taxes 
for and  we recognized a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate was for as compared with for in  the effective rate was lower than the us statutory rate of primarily due to a tax benefit in the united kingdom of million  reflecting the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  and a tax refund in the united states of million relating to a net operating loss carryback that had a previously established valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in  the tax provision was affected by certain transaction costs and by operating losses in taxing jurisdictions for which valuation allowances have been provided because of the uncertainty surrounding the future utilization of such net operating loss carryforwards 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for remained essentially constant at million from million for in  of our net sales were in our clothing segment and were in our roll cover segment 
in our clothing segment  net sales for increased by million  or  to million from million for the increase is primarily attributable to currency gains of million related to the 
table of contents translation of sales made in currencies other than the us dollar to us dollars for financial reporting purposes  partially offset by the million impact of the currency effect on pricing relating to sales prices indexed in us dollars by certain us operations as compared to overall pricing levels were generally unchanged for as compared with in our roll covers segment  net sales for decreased by million  or  to million from million for the decrease is due to decreased sales of million resulting primarily from weak market conditions in europe  partially offset by currency gains of million related to the translation of sales made in currencies other than the us dollar to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
overall pricing levels were generally unchanged for as compared with cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for increased million  or  to million from million for in our clothing segment  cost of products sold increased by million  or  to million from million for this increase was primarily due to adverse currency translation effects of million and million of added operating costs incurred in connection with the transition of production operations from a closed facility to another facility 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of a lower cost structure during  as compared to our cost structure for  of million as a result of our cost reduction programs 
in our roll covers segment  cost of products sold increased by million  or  to million from million for this increase was primarily attributable to unfavorable currency translation effects of million and to an unfavorable shift in the mix of our product sales to lower margin products 
the unfavorable product mix shift occurred globally but is primarily related to a shift in north america from our more profitable rubber covers to other types of covers and increased sales in mechanical services and spreader rolls  which carry lower margins than our roll covers 
this mix effect and the currency translation effects were partially offset by the impact of a lower cost structure during  as compared to our cost structure for  of million as a result of our cost reduction programs 
selling expenses 
for  selling expenses increased by million  or  to million from million for this increase was due primarily to higher commissions and an increased sales force headcount in north and south america in an effort to increase sales through expanded sales coverage  to enhance the introduction of new products and to address shifting markets 
selling expenses also increased in as compared to as a result of unfavorable currency translation effects of million 
partially offsetting these increases was the impact of a lower cost structure during  as compared to our cost structure for  of million as a result of our cost reduction programs 
general and administrative expenses 
for  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million from million for the increase was primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with the closing of our initial public offering on may  and related transactions which included i million of compensation expense related to the vesting of stock options and restricted stock in connection with the offering  ii million of special one time cash payments in connection with the adoption of our new management incentive compensation plans  iii million of cash transaction bonuses paid to management and iv million of land transfer taxes related to certain of our subsidiaries in connection with the offering 
additionally  general and administrative expenses increased by i million of costs to support the requirements of being a public company  including costs related to preparing to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and the regulations promulgated thereunder  ii million of costs related to the legal reorganization of our brazilian subsidiaries  iii million of compensation expense incurred as a result of restricted stock units granted under our equity incentive plan  iv decreased royalty income of million primarily as a result of a one time catch up payment in that did not recur in and v unfavorable currency effects of million 
these increases were partially offset by i impact of a lower cost structure

restructuring and impairments expenses 
for  restructuring and impairments expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million during these expenses relate to our long term strategy to reduce production costs and improve long term competitiveness as described above under cost reduction programs 
for  restructuring and impairments expenses consist of severance  facility  and asset impairment costs of million  million  and million  respectively 
for  restructuring and impairments expenses consist of severance  facility  and asset impairment costs of million  million  and million  respectively 
research and development expenses 
for  research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million from million for the increase is due to the development and launch costs of polyurethane roll cover products with enhanced performance characteristics  which we introduced in the third quarter of interest expense  net 
net interest expense for decreased by million  or  to million from million for the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances outstanding during as compared with  as a result of the refinancing that occurred in connection with our initial public offering on may   and to lower interest rates on our current credit facility as compared to our debt facilities prior to the initial public offering 
additionally  higher interest rates on hedge contracts that expired in contributed to the decrease in net interest expense for as compared with foreign exchange gain loss 
for  we had a foreign exchange gain of million compared to a foreign exchange loss of million for this million difference was primarily attributable to the manner in which swings in the value of the us dollar as compared to other currencies  primarily the euro  affected certain intercompany transactions and  up until may   the reported amount of our external debt 
under our previously existing senior and mezzanine debt facilities  certain of our subsidiaries had debt denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and  as a result  the changes in relative exchange rates created a foreign exchange gain or loss 
under our current credit facility  the majority of amounts borrowed are denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary  which we expect will mitigate the amount of future foreign exchange gain or loss related to external debt 
foreign exchange gains and losses since may  resulted primarily from intercompany activity 
loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on may   we repaid million of principal and interest on previously existing senior bank debt  mezzanine bank debt and certain non interest bearing shareholder notes 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt includes the write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the debt that was repaid 
provision for income taxes 
for and  we recognized a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate was for as compared with for the effective tax rate exceeds the statutory tax rate of primarily due to the recording of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the effect of the mix in earnings among geographical regions in which our income was earned for as compared with 
table of contents dividend policy in we paid aggregate cash dividends of per share of common stock as follows per share paid on march  to shareholders of record on march   per share paid on june  to shareholders of record on june   per share paid on september  to shareholders of record on september   and per share paid on december  to shareholders of record on december  aggregate cash dividend payments in were million 
we paid these dividends in in accordance with our board of directors dividend policy that reflected a judgment that our stockholders would be better served if we distributed to them a substantial portion of the excess cash generated by our business in excess of operating needs  reserves for contingencies  interest and principal payments on indebtedness  capital expenditures  restructuring expenses and tax payments as regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock  up to an annual dividend rate of per share  rather than retaining such cash for other purposes such as significant acquisitions or to pursue growth opportunities requiring capital expenditures or other investments significantly beyond planned amounts 
we believe that our dividend policy limits our ability to pursue growth  including growth opportunities requiring capital expenditures or other investment beyond our current expectations and significant acquisitions 
we expect to reevaluate our dividend policy and the rate at which we pay quarterly dividends on a quarterly basis taking into account such factors as our financial performance  the sufficiency of cash flow from operations to fund dividends  our cash position and cash requirements  growth opportunity and acquisition strategies  competitive or technological developments  the level of participation in our dividend reinvestment plan  credit facility limitations and other contractual restrictions  debt repayment considerations  provisions of applicable law  and other considerations that our board of directors may deem relevant 
based upon our expected level of expenditures for  our financial performance would need to improve from that of to pay million in cash dividends  the amount paid in  out of our cash flow from operations in as described below  certain apax entities have committed to participate in our dividend reinvestment plan in  which will reduce the cash that otherwise would be required with respect to dividends declared in if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund dividends  we would expect to reduce the rate at which we pay dividends 
our credit facility also imposes important limitations on our ability to pay dividends 
we believe that our credit facility would not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock at an per share annual rate in without the commitment of the apax entities to participate in our dividend reinvestment plan in as described below  and even with this commitment  depending upon the level of our expenditures and our financial performance  our credit facility may still prohibit the payment of dividends at this rate in see credit facility below 
in february  we established a dividend reinvestment plan drip that allows shareholders of record to elect to receive all or part the dividends on shares of our common stock that otherwise would be paid in cash in the form of additional shares of common stock 
under the drip  the source of such additional shares will be from our authorized and unissued shares or from our treasury shares 
the number of shares credited to a participant s account with respect to a dividend will be determined based upon the cash value of the dividends elected to be received in additional shares of common stock divided by the average closing price for shares of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on the five trading days up to and including the declared payment date

and apax xerium apia lp collectively the apax entities agreed that they will participate in the drip through december  at a level such that at a minimum of each dividend otherwise payable in cash on our common stock  including shares not held by apax entities  is reinvested in our common stock through the 
table of contents drip  provided that the apax entities are not required to reinvest more than of the cash dividends payable to them with respect to such dividend declaration 
as of december  there were  shares of our common stock outstanding  of which  were held by the apax entities 
as more fully described in risk factors in this annual report on form k  the participation of the apax entities and other shareholders in the drip would increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock eligible to participate in future dividends and  to the extent other shareholders do not participate in the drip  result in the participating shareholders owning an increased percentage of our common stock 
the apax entities have made no commitment to participate in the drip beyond as more fully described in risk factors in this annual report on form k  shareholders may not receive any dividends as a result of the following factors we are not obligated to pay dividends  our credit facility limits the amount of dividends we are permitted to pay based upon our level of pre dividend free cash flow  our credit facility contains restrictive covenants  including covenants requiring compliance with minimum interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum leverage ratios  that will require us to improve our performance over time to remain in compliance therewith  our board of directors may modify or revoke our dividend policy  even if our dividend policy is not modified or revoked  our board of directors could decide to reduce dividends or not to pay dividends at all  at any time and for any reason  the amount of dividends distributed is subject to state law restrictions  our shareholders have no contractual or other legal right to dividends  we may not have enough cash to pay dividends due to changes to our operating earnings  working capital requirements  funding of growth initiatives and anticipated cash needs  and our foreign subsidiaries may be subject to legal restrictions that prevent them from distributing cash to us to enable the payment of dividends 
see credit facility below for a discussion of the limitations on our ability to pay dividends imposed by our credit facility 
under delaware law  we can only pay dividends either out of surplus which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities  minus statutory capital or out of current or the immediately preceding year s earnings 
we historically have not had sufficient earnings to pay dividends at the level contemplated by our dividend policy 
we do not know whether we will have sufficient earnings to pay dividends in the future and therefore may have to pay dividends out of surplus 
our board of directors will seek periodically to assure itself that we have sufficient surplus to pay dividends before actually declaring any dividends 
further  our board of directors may seek opinions from outside valuation firms to the effect that there is sufficient surplus to pay dividends  and such opinions may not be forthcoming 
if we sought and were not able to obtain such an opinion  we likely would not be able to declare and pay dividends 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and to pay dividends 
we expect to fund our liquidity requirements primarily with cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  through borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million increase in as compared with and the million decrease in cash flow from operating activities in as compared to is primarily due to activities related 
table of contents to our initial public offering that occurred on may  which resulted in approximately million of payments of ipo related costs  approximately million of payments to the prior parent company to cover its liabilities and million of accelerated cash interest payments 
partially offsetting the increase in was a decrease in working capital items  primarily as a result of decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses  as compared with net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to i payments for the acquisitions in of coldwater covers  inc and pma shoji co 
ltd 
totaling million and ii an offset in cash used for investing activities for of million reflecting the proceeds from the sale of our wake forest  north carolina manufacturing 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in capital equipment spending of million in as compared with and ii million of proceeds from the sale of our dewatering equipment business in august the decrease in cash used in investing activities in as compared to was related to an increase in proceeds from the disposal of assets of million during  of which million resulted from the sale of our wake forest facility in the first quarter of net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million in and net cash used in financing activities was million in during  the million of net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the completion of our initial public offering on may  additionally  the decrease during as compared with was primarily the result of million of dividend payments to our shareholders during compared to million during as we did not begin making dividend payments to our shareholders until after the completion of our initial public offering  the first of which was made on september  we also made voluntary repayments of senior debt in of million and paid million of fees related to the amendments of our credit facility in the increase of million in as compared with is primarily the result of our initial public offering  which occurred on may   partially offset by cash dividend payments of million 
see initial public offering below for additional discussion 
as of december   there was a million balance of term loans outstanding under our senior credit facility 
the decrease from the million issued on may  was due to i changes in currency exchange rates impacting debt denominated in currencies other than the us dollar ii quarterly principal payments of to million beginning with the quarter ended september   as required under the term loan and iii voluntary repayments of senior debt during totalling million 
in addition  as of december   we had an aggregate of million outstanding under our current revolving lines of credit  including the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility and lines of credit in various foreign countries that are used to facilitate local short term operating needs and an aggregate of million available for additional borrowings under these revolving lines of credit 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures we use the term capital expenditures to refer to costs incurred to purchase property and equipment 
the majority of our capital expenditures relate to purchases of machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products 
capital expenditures were funded from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
growth capital expenditures consist of items that are intended to increase the manufacturing  production and or distribution capacity or efficiencies of our operations in conjunction with the execution of our business strategies 
maintenance capital expenditures are designed to sustain the current capacity or efficiency of our operations and 
table of contents include items relating to the renovation of existing manufacturing or service facilities  the purchase of machinery and equipment for existing manufacturing or service facilities and safety and environmental needs 
included in the million and million amounts are million of capital expenditures to expand production capacity in brazil which are excluded from certain limitations imposed by our credit facility 
see credit facility below for a discussion on the restrictions imposed on our ability to make capital expenditures by our credit facility 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures  including million of expenditures resulting from restructuring activities under our cost reduction programs  and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
we expect that capital expenditures in as compared to not including capital expenditures of million spent in and up to million that we expect to spend in  in each case to expand production capacity in brazil and that are excluded from certain limitations imposed by our credit facility as described under credit facility below will be approximately million higher 
this increase is based in large part on growth capital expenditures in asia that we expect to make over the next several years 
accordingly  subject to the limitations imposed on capital expenditures by our credit facility  we expect capital expenditures to be higher than the level for the next several years 
initial public offering on may  we completed our initial public offering  with a related debt refinancing  and a reorganization 
prior to the offering  xerium technologies  inc was an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of xerium sa  subsequent to the offering  we directly or indirectly hold all of the operating subsidiaries and related holding companies of the former corporate group of xerium sa  excluding the former parent  xerium sa  and two holding company subsidiaries of xerium sa  xerium sa and xerium sa the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect the operations of xerium technologies  inc and its subsidiaries after the effect of this reorganization 
prior to the offering  xerium technologies  inc had outstanding one share of 
par value common stock that was held by xerium sa in connection with the offering  we effected a  for stock split of this common stock and accordingly  all share and per share amounts related to common stock included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been presented as if this stock split had occurred as of the earliest period presented 
in connection with the offering  xerium technologies  inc issued  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share and entered into a million credit facility agreement  under which million was borrowed in connection with the offering and which has a seven year maturity 
in connection with the offering  we repaid million of principal and interest on the previously existing senior bank debt  mezzanine bank debt and certain non interest bearing shareholder notes  as well as million of contractual payments under various rate swap agreements which were used to hedge the floating rate senior and mezzanine debt 
we wrote off million of deferred financing costs related to the repayment of this debt as of may   which is classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt in the accompanying statements of operations 
costs related to our reorganization  debt recapitalization and the offering include the following million of fees and expenses including i million to underwriters charged against paid in capital  ii million to arrangers and lenders capitalized as deferred financing costs and iii million of other fees and expenses including million related to the offering and 
table of contents charged against paid in capital  million related to the debt recapitalization and capitalized as deferred financing costs and million charged to interest expense related to contractual payments under various rate swap agreements which were used to hedge the floating rate of previously existing senior and mezzanine debt  million of non cash compensation expense related to the vesting of stock options and restricted stock in connection with the offering charged to general and administrative expense  million in compensation expense for the portion of cash transaction bonuses that were paid to members of our management team in connection with the offering charged to general and administrative expense 
in addition  xerium technologies  inc distributed million to xerium sa to reimburse xerium sa for certain pre closing liabilities and million to xerium sa to fund certain expenses expected to be incurred by xerium sa following the offering 
prior to the offering  we had outstanding million of non interest bearing loans 
upon the closing of the offering  we repaid million of these loans with cash  the remaining million was repaid by xerium sa with an obligation to deliver shares of xerium technologies  inc this repayment with shares is considered to be a capital contribution to xerium technologies  inc in connection with the offering  directors and members of our senior management who owned common stock of xerium sa or held options to purchase common stock of xerium sa transferred their equity interests in xerium sa to xerium technologies  inc in exchange for  shares of common stock of xerium technologies  inc we used the shares received in this exchange to redeem  shares of our common stock from xerium sa additionally  xerium technologies  inc received  shares of its common stock from xerium sa  which represented xerium sa shares held by a subsidiary of xerium technologies  inc that were not allocated to the issuance of shares related to stock options that were exercised in connection with the offering 
these shares were subsequently retired 
in addition  million of the offering proceeds were used to purchase  shares of common stock from certain directors and members of senior management 
all such shares were retired by the company in connection with the offering 
upon completion of the offering  the total amount of our authorized capital stock consisted of  shares of 
par value common stock and  shares of 
par value preferred stock  of which  shares of common stock were outstanding and no shares of preferred stock were outstanding 
following the completion of our initial public offering  we incurred additional annual administrative costs associated with being a public company 
approximately and million of such costs were incurred in and  respectively 
credit facility upon the completion of the initial public of offering of our common stock on may  we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a senior secured credit facility 
our credit facility provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility and a term loan in a total principal amount of million 
in december the funding of a legal reorganization of a portion of our international operations was completed and million of our previous million revolving credit facility was canceled 
on february   the credit facility was amended to permit certain additional capital expenditures  subject to the other provisions of the credit facility  in and in connection the expansion of production capacity in brazil 
provide that such additional capital expenditures do not reduce pre dividend free cash flow as such term is defined in the credit facility and below 

table of contents increase the applicable margin for us dollar libor term loans from to 
change the minimum interest coverage ratio for the fiscal quarters ending june   september  and march  change the maximum leverage ratio for the fiscal quarters ending march  through december  we paid an amendment fee of million in connection with this amendment 
on december   we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility  which includes  among other changes  the following changes loosening of the interest coverage ratio covenant from the fourth quarter of through and the leverage ratio covenant from through  as set forth below 
changes to the pre dividend free cash flow test to limit the amount of quarterly dividends that we may pay beginning after december  to of pre dividend free cash flow as defined in the senior credit facility for the preceding four quarters and to limit the amount of quarterly dividends that we may pay commencing december  to of pre dividend free cash flow for the preceding four quarters 
dividends applied to newly issued or treasury shares of common stock of the company pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan will not be treated as dividend payments for the purpose of the pre dividend free cash flow test and will not reduce excess cash as defined in the senior credit facility 
the amount to which the balance on the revolving credit facility must be reduced for at least consecutive days during each fiscal year is increased from zero to million 
changes in specially permitted capital expenditures for brazil that alter expansion of production capacity in brazil and that shift a portion of the amount specially permitted for to the applicable margin on the revolving and term loans is increased by and subject to a further increase of an additional in the event that the indebtedness under the senior credit facility is rated lower than b by moody s or lower than b by standard poor s 
we paid an amendment fee of million in connection with the second amendment 
the description below describes the credit facility  as amended on december  the credit facility  as amended  is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of most of our subsidiaries that were guarantors under the previously existing credit facility in all cases subject to legal and tax considerations and requirements 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan facility bear interest  at our option  at either a libor plus the applicable margin or b the euribor rate plus the applicable margin  in each case in addition to certain other mandatory costs associated with syndication in the european markets 
the applicable margin for libor term loans  libor revolving loans  euribor loans and cdor loans is set at  subject to an increase by in the event that the indebtedness under the senior credit facility is rated lower than b by moody s or lower than b by standard poor s 
in february  moody s reduced its rating of the senior credit facility to below b  triggering this increase in the applicable margin 
if the indebtedness under the credit facility subsequently achieves ratings of b or higher by moody s and b or higher by standard and poor s after having fallen below one or both of these levels  the applicable margin will be decreased by 
the applicable margin with respect to the revolving loans may be reduced by or based on a leverage test set forth in the credit agreement 
following the initial public offering we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the interest rate on approximately of the term loan credit facility through june  and  as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the effectively fixed portion of the term loan facility was 
the revolving credit facility has a year maturity and the term loan facility has a year maturity from the date of the agreement 

table of contents the credit facility provides for scheduled principal payments on the term loan of million each year  payable in quarterly installments that began september   million due in march and million due at maturity in may the credit facility will also require us to prepay outstanding loans under the term loan facility under the following circumstances with of the net cash proceeds received by us from any sale  transfer or other disposition of any assets  subject to certain customary reinvestment rights and with an exemption for sales of up to  for any transaction or series of related transactions  exemption of the first  of cumulative net proceeds and exemption of up to an additional  of net proceeds from the sale of four identified manufacturing facilities  with of the net cash proceeds received by us from any insurance recovery or condemnation events  subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights and with an exemption for the first  of cumulative net insurance or condemnation proceeds  with of the net cash proceeds from the incurrence of any indebtedness by us  subject to customary exceptions  and on an annual basis with of the amount equal to our excess cash  that is our pre dividend free cash flow as defined in our credit facility and described below minus our actual dividend payments for the preceding fiscal year excluding the amount of dividends applied to newly issued or treasury shares of our common stock pursuant to a dividend reinvestment program except that commencing with such prepayment to be made with respect to excess cash in  in the event our dividend payments exceed of our pre dividend free cash flow we will be required to make prepayments in the amount of for and for and thereafter of our excess cash 
during the first quarter of  we will make a mandatory prepayment of million 
our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial covenants in order to avoid a default or event of default under the facility 
these covenants are as follows our interest coverage ratio as of the end of any period set forth below must exceed the ratio set forth for such period period ratio fiscal quarters ending december  through september  fiscal quarters ending december  through june  fiscal quarters ending september  through march  fiscal quarters ending june  through december  fiscal quarters ending march  and june  fiscal quarters ending september  through march  our leverage ratio as of the end of any period set forth below must not exceed the ratio set forth for such period period ratio fiscal quarter ending december  through june  fiscal quarters ending september  and december  fiscal quarters ending march  through september  fiscal quarters ending december  and march  fiscal quarters ending june  through december  fiscal quarters ending march  through december  fiscal quarters ending march  through march  our fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of any period set forth below must exceed the ratio set forth for such period period ratio fiscal quarters ending september  through december  fiscal quarters ending march  through december  fiscal quarters ending march  and thereafter 
table of contents for the four fiscal quarters ended december  our interest coverage ratio was  our leverage ratio was and our fixed charge coverage ratio was our ability to comply with the financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control  such as prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions  including unfavorable foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar and increases in the interest rate on our debt resulting from changes in market interest rates 
in addition  as described above  in february  the interest rate on our debt increased as a result of a downgrade in the rating of our senior indebtedness by moody s 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with such financial ratios 
because the financial ratios become more restrictive over time  our financial performance will need to improve in subsequent periods in order for us to remain in compliance with the financial ratios in subsequent periods 
in particular  in order to be in compliance with the interest coverage ratio in respect of the four fiscal quarters ending december   we will need to generate adjusted ebitda during such period that  depending upon factors affecting interest expense in  including changes in market interest rates affecting the unhedged portion of the interest on our senior indebtedness  and the extent to which we utilize our revolving loan  is nearly equal to or in excess of the amount of adjusted ebitda we generated in our credit facility limits the amount of our capital expenditures in any given fiscal year to an amount not exceeding million for each fiscal year from through and million for fiscal year and fiscal year  in each such case exclusive of excess cash amounts permitted to be spent on capital expenditures  provided that in addition to these maximum amounts  subject to the other provisions of the credit facility  we are permitted to make additional capital expenditures solely to expand production capacity in brazil in  and in aggregate amounts of up to million  million and million  respectively 
our ability to comply in future periods with the financial covenants in our credit facility will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance  which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control including currency exchange rates  and will be substantially dependent on the level of demand for our products  our ability to compete effectively and our ability to otherwise successfully implement our overall business strategies  including our ability to realize the benefits of our cost reduction programs 
costs we incur as a result of initiatives we undertake may also impact our ability to comply with the financial ratios 
for example  we expect to incur significant restructuring expenses in in connection with our presently contemplated cost reduction efforts 
under our credit facility  restructuring expense above specified limits reduce adjusted ebitda  see non gaap liquidity measures 
to the extent that expenses incurred in in connection with these efforts exceed actual cost reductions in by more than the amount that is not considered in calculating adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda in and our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facility for that period would be negatively affected 
our credit facility also restricts our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock as follows prior to december  we were permitted to pay dividends in an amount not to exceed million in the aggregate per fiscal quarter  beginning with december   we may pay dividends  not including for purposes of the limitation dividends applied to newly issued or treasury shares of our common stock pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan  on each quarterly dividend payment date in up to an amount that does not exceed of our pre dividend free cash flow as defined in our credit facility for the four fiscal quarters ended immediately prior to such dividend payment date 
pre dividend free cash flow is defined in our credit facility as adjusted ebitda minus the sum of i net interest expense paid in cash  ii net cash taxes  iii cash capital expenditures reduced by the amount of any asset sale  insurance or condemnation proceeds which we are permitted to retain in our business  any capital expenditures made with the proceeds of previously generated surplus cash and any capital expenditures used to expand production capacity in brazil in up to million  up to million and up to million iv all scheduled debt repayments  v cash restructuring expenses up to specified amounts per the credit facility and vi cash payments of withholding taxes from proceeds of the repurchase  redemption or retention of our common stock relating to equity incentive awards  and 
table of contents during the period commencing december  and thereafter  we may pay quarterly dividends  not including for the purposes of the limitation dividends applied to newly issued or treasury shares of our common stock pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan  up to an amount that does not exceed of our pre dividend free cash flow for the four fiscal quarters ended immediately prior to such dividend payment date 
we may not pay dividends if a default or event of default under our new credit facility has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such payment 
we generated million of pre dividend free cash flow for the twelve month period ended december  this level of pre dividend free cash flow for the four fiscal quarters preceding the quarterly dividend payment dates in would permit maximum quarterly cash dividend payments not including dividends applied to newly issued or treasury shares of our common stock pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan of million 
to the extent that adjusted ebitda remains at levels but expenditures used in calculating pre dividend free cash flow increase  the maximum permitted quarterly dividend payments would be lower 
in particular  we expect capital expenditures to be higher in than in the amount of cash required to pay quarterly dividends in at the per share level declared for the march  dividend payment date depends on the number of shares outstanding and the level of participation in our dividend reinvestment plan or drip 
approximately million of cash would be required to pay the quarterly dividend scheduled for march  at per share based upon  shares of common stock outstanding as of december  and an assumed participation rate of in the drip 
we expect that the number of our shares outstanding will increase as a result of participation in the drip 
the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with the drip will depend on the dividends declared by us  the level of participation in the drip and the trading price of our common stock applied in calculating the shares issued pursuant to the drip 
see dividend policy above 
more cash would be required to pay quarterly dividends at the per share level in succeeding quarters of if the number of our shares of common stock outstanding increases and the participation in the drip were at the level for each of these dividends 
we expect that expenditures used in calculating pre dividend free cash flow will  in the aggregate  be approximately million greater for as compared to primarily as a result of our expectation that expenditures in for capital investment not including capital expenditures of million spent in and up to million that we expect to spend in  in each case to expand production capacity in brazil that  subject to compliance with the other provisions of our credit facility  do not reduce pre dividend free cash flow will be million higher in than in we expect that net interest expense paid in cash  scheduled debt repayments and cash payments of withholding taxes from proceeds of the repurchase  redemption or retention of our common stock relating to equity incentive awards will  in the aggregate  be at a similar level for as compared to see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate hedging below for a discussion of the impact of changes in interest rates on our expected interest expense 
the amount of our cash income tax costs in will be largely dependent on the geographies in which our income for is earned  and therefore if our adjusted ebitda for were at the same level as in  million  cash income taxes for could be higher or lower than in pre dividend free cash flow for may also be adversely affected by the restructuring expenses described above that we expect to incur in if these expenses in exceed the associated savings in the apax entities have made no commitment to participate in the drip beyond assuming no participation in the drip in the first quarter of  the amount of cash required to pay a dividend in such quarter at the per share level would be million plus  per each additional million shares outstanding above the  shares of common stock outstanding as of december  for example  if we paid quarterly dividends of per share each quarter in  the stock price of our common stock remained at a constant per share the closing price on december  during  the level of participation in the drip was for each quarterly dividend and there were no changes in our outstanding common stock other than as a result of the drip  we would have issued approximately million 
table of contents shares pursuant to the drip in and million of cash would be required to pay a cash dividend of per share in the first quarter of without any participation in the drip in that quarter 
based on our expected expenditures for that impact pre dividend free cash flow described above  if our adjusted ebitda were at the same level for as for  our pre dividend free cash flow for would be million and our credit facility would limit the maximum quarterly cash dividend payment in the first quarter of  assuming no participation in the drip for such quarter  to million  or approximately per share if there were million shares of common stock entitled to participate in such dividend 
under our credit facility  capital expenditures financed with the proceeds from certain asset sales do not reduce pre dividend free cash flow 
as we evaluate our dividend policy and the rate at which we pay quarterly dividends  we may consider funding a portion of our capital expenditures with all or a portion of the approximately million proceeds from asset sales through december  and million of previously generated surplus cash available for such funding in accordance with the credit facility 
pre dividend free cash flow as defined in our credit facility does not represent the amount we intend to distribute as dividends for any period but rather is a restriction on the maximum level of dividend payments  if any  that we will be permitted to declare and pay under the terms of our credit facility 
see dividend policy above 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides aggregated information about our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt interest expense on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement obligations total contractual cash obligations includes obligations with respect to raw materials purchases  repair and maintenance services  utilities and capital expenditures 
interest expense shown above is based on the effective interest rate as of december  plus an increase of as a result of moody s downgrade of its rating of our senior debt in february as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the effectively fixed portion of the term loan facility was and the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed  based on the day libor  was 
the interest rate on of the term loan portion of the credit facility is effectively fixed by interest rate swap contracts through june  off balance sheet financing during the year ended december   we have not engaged in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have formal accounting policies in place including those that address critical and complex accounting areas 
note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report identify the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 

table of contents goodwill 
we account for acquired goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

as a result  goodwill and other indefinite lived assets are not amortized 
purchase accounting required by sfas no 
involves judgment with respect to the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities in order to determine the final amount of goodwill 
we believe that the estimates that we have used to record prior acquisitions are reasonable and in accordance with sfas no 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we account for acquired goodwill and goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

this pronouncement requires considerable judgment in the valuation of acquired goodwill and the ongoing evaluation of goodwill impairment 
we perform an annual test for goodwill impairment as of december st at the business segment level 
we have two business segments clothing and roll covers 
when the company s business was acquired in  more than of the goodwill was assigned to the roll covers segment 
in  segment earnings were million for the clothing segment and million for the roll covers segment 
to determine if an impairment exists  the fair value of each business segment is compared to its carrying value 
for the purpose of performing the annual impairment test we allocate all shared assets and liabilities to the business segments based upon the percentage of each segment s revenue to total revenue 
shared expenses are allocated to each segment to the extent necessary to allow them to operate as independent businesses 
fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of both a market multiple approach and an income approach 
the market multiple approach utilizes market transactions  ownership interests or securities traded in public companies ie guideline companies to determine measures that are used to value the company s business segments 
the income approach is a present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flows produced by each business segment 
determining the fair value of a business segment or an indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions  among others 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test under sfas no 
are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our respective business segments as of december   the annual test date  was approximately million for the clothing segment and million for the roll covers segment 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each business segment  which resulted in a carrying value in excess of fair value of approximately and million for the clothing and roll covers segments  respectively 
contingencies 
we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax  environmental and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
our consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
while we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate  the adequacy of these reserves may change in the future due to new developments in particular matters 
we have expensed million net of a million settlement from a potentially responsible party  million and million in  and  respectively  for environmental costs related to contamination at two former manufacturing sites which were closed under our restructuring programs 
management believes that the environmental issues at these two sites have been remediated and we not expect to incur significant additional costs related thereto 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and statutes that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 

table of contents we have recognized a net deferred tax liability of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the deferred taxes relate principally to pension and post retirement benefits  intangible assets and differences between the book and tax bases of property and equipment 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
relevant evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 
in light of our accumulated loss position in certain tax jurisdictions at december   and the uncertainty of profitability in future periods  we recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in the united states  united kingdom and sweden 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for income taxes or withholding taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to both income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various jurisdictions 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability or withholding taxes is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation  however  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards would be available to reduce some portion of the liability 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues and rely on estimates and assumptions 
these audits may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
although the company believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  which discontinues the accounting for share based compensation using apb no 
and generally requires that such transactions be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is related to employee attrition and based on a historical analysis of its employee turnover  the company currently estimates that approximately of time based and performance based rsus will be forfeited 
this analysis will be re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary

postretirement plans 
we have various defined benefit plans 
we also have an unfunded plan to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to substantially all retired us employees 
we use assumptions  such as expected long term return on plan assets and discount rate  to determine our pension expense  and assumptions  as healthcare cost trend rate  to determine our postretirement health care expense

fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging 
we have foreign currency cash flow and earnings exposure with respect to specific sale transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the unit incurring the costs associated with such transactions 
to mitigate the risks related to this exposure  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances  to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain on the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedging strategy 
in south america  substantially all of our sales are indexed to us dollars  but the associated costs are recorded in the local currencies of the operating units 
generally  we do not hedge this us dollar exposure as it would not be cost effective due to the relatively inefficient foreign exchange markets for local currencies in that region 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
as of december   we had open foreign currency exchange contracts maturing through november with total net notional amounts of approximately million 
at december   we prepared an analysis to determine the sensitivity of our forward foreign exchange contracts to changes in exchange rates 
a hypothetical adverse exchange rate movement of against our forward foreign exchange contracts would have resulted in a potential net loss in fair value of these contracts of approximately million 
all such losses on these forward foreign exchange contracts would be substantially offset by gains on the underlying transactions that we had hedged 
for additional information about the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations foreign exchange 
interest rate hedging 
our senior credit facility has a variable interest rate 
we entered into interest rate swap contracts effective june  pursuant to which we pay fixed rates on us dollar notional amounts while receiving the applicable floating libor rates 
the interest rate swap contracts effectively fix the interest rate on of the term loan portion of the credit facility through june  as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the effectively fixed portion of the term loan facility was  the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed by interest rate swap contracts  based on the day libor  was 
in february  the applicable margin for libor term loans  libor revolving loans  euribor loans and cdor loans under our senior credit facility increased from to as a result of moody s downgrade of its rating of our senior indebtedness 
we estimate that a increase in the libor rate would increase our interest expense on the term debt by approximately million on an annual basis through june   the period covered by the interest rate swap agreements 
to the extent that we do enter into a hedging arrangement that effectively fixes the interest rate on a portion of our senior debt after these contracts expire  the effectively fixed rate may be significantly higher than the effectively fixed rate as of december  if we do not enter into new interest rate hedging arrangements  when these contracts expire the interest rate on all of the debt covered by our senior credit facility will fluctuate based on libor and other variable interest rates 
to the extent these interest rates increase  our interest expense will increase  in which event  we may have difficulty making interest payments and funding our other costs and our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facility may be adversely affected
