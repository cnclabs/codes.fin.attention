table of contents employees as of march   our global workforce totaled approximately  employees 
in certain international locations  our employees are represented by labor unions and by work councils 
we have never experienced a significant work stoppage or strike  and we believe that our employee relations are good 
our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of such personnel could seriously harm our business  results of operations and business prospects 
to date  we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining such personnel 
although we are not aware that any of our key personnel currently intend to terminate their employment  we cannot guarantee their future services 
environmental regulation our operations are regulated under various federal  state  local and international laws governing the environment  including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
we have in place infrastructures to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and we do not believe that costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  operating results  or competitive position 
in addition  we are responsible for cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former manufacturing facilities and at some third party sites 
we engage environmental consulting firms to assist us in the evaluation of environmental liabilities of our ongoing operations  historical disposal activities and closed sites in order to establish appropriate accruals in our financial statements 
we determined the amount of our accruals for environmental matters by analyzing and estimating the range of possible costs in light of information currently available 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by us at our operating facilities  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
while no material exposures have been identified to date that we are aware of  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known 
we are also required to comply with an increasing number of product environmental compliance regulations focused on the restriction of certain hazardous substances 
our business requires close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to mitigate risk of non compliance 
most recently  we completed the implementation of our internal conformance program for the european union s directive ec rohs and to the first phase of the china rohs directive 
we have developed rigorous risk mitigating compliance programs designed to meet the needs of our customers as well as the regulations 
these programs vary from collecting compliance data from our suppliers to full laboratory testing  and we require our supply chain to comply 
non compliance could potentially result in significant costs and or penalties 
in addition  the electronics industry is subject to the european union s waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive  which became effective beginning in similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions  including in the united states  canada  mexico  china and japan 
weee requires industry oems to assume responsibility for the collection  recycling and management of waste electronic products and components 
although the compliance responsibility rests primarily with oems rather than with ems companies  oems may turn to ems companies for assistance in meeting their weee obligations 
intellectual property we own or have licensed various united states and foreign patents related to a variety of technologies 
for certain of our proprietary processes  we rely on trade secret protection 
we also have registered our corporate name and several other trademarks and service marks that we use in our business in the united states and other countries throughout the world 
although we believe that our intellectual property assets and licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business as we currently conduct it  we cannot assure you that third parties will not make infringement claims 
table of contents against us in the future 
in addition  we are increasingly providing design and engineering services to our customers and designing and making our own products 
as a consequence of these activities  we are required to address and allocate the ownership and responsibility for intellectual property in our customer relationships to a greater extent than in our manufacturing and assembly businesses 
if a third party were to make an assertion regarding the ownership or right to use intellectual property  we could be required to either enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve the issue through litigation 
such license rights may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  and any such litigation may not be resolved in our favor 
additionally  litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially harm our financial condition regardless of the outcome 
we also could be required to incur substantial costs to redesign a product or re perform design services
