item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under forward looking statements and item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals and  to a lesser extent  other sorbent materials 
our principal products include cat litter  industrial and automotive floor absorbents  fluid purification and filtration bleaching clays  agricultural chemical carriers and sports field products 
our products are sold to two primary customer groups  including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end customer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product 
we have two reportable operating segments  the retail and wholesale products group and the business to business products group 
each operating segment is discussed individually below 
additional detailed descriptions of the operating segments are included in item business 
on january   our market capitalization met the threshold required to become an accelerated filer under rule b of the exchange act 
consequently  the due date of this form k and subsequent form q filings are accelerated from due dates in prior fiscal years 
in addition  we are now required to comply with the internal control reporting requirements mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we reported net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   a increase over net income of  or 
per diluted share  for the year ended july  results for fiscal were driven by net sales growth in our retail and wholesale products group due to a focus on strategic pricing 
we also addressed cost challenges through on going cost savings programs and plant efficiency improvements 
procurement programs aimed at cost reduction throughout the organization included a focus on inventory reduction  capital management and purchased materials and services 
fiscal also brought some relief in the prices of natural gas and fuel oil used in our manufacturing processes  which reached record high levels in fiscal in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita 
margins improved during fiscal as a result of our internal initiatives and lower fuel prices  however we continue to operate in a challenging competitive environment in the global market place 
we face continuing cost pressures  particularly in manufacturing and transportation costs 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july   were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal our retail and wholesale products group drove the sales improvement 
we focused on strategic pricing company wide in an effort to recover declining margins 
net income for the year was  an increase of from net income of  in fiscal a increase in operating income for the retail and wholesale products group was a major contributor to the net income growth 
the business to business group reported lower net sales and operating income in fiscal due to the declining market for agricultural chemical carriers 
this group was also impacted more by increases in costs of materials 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  a decrease of  from net sales of  in fiscal net sales of agricultural chemical carriers  animal health and nutrition products and co packaged products all declined 
agricultural chemical carrier net sales decreased due to lower volume as genetically modified seed and other seed treatments continued to erode the market for these carriers 
the decrease in carrier production also decreased the availability of the group s flo fre product line because our flo fre product is a by product of the manufacture of our agricultural chemical carriers  which in turn caused a further decline in net sales 
animal health and nutrition net sales decreased due to the discontinued production of our poultry guard product during the second quarter of fiscal  however  the discontinuation of this product did not have a material impact on net income 
our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales were down in fiscal coarse cat litter sales have declined in the overall cat litter market as scoopable cat litter sales have increased 
in contrast  sports field products net sales were up and volume was up 
the sports field product sales increase was driven by strong sales of baseball products and price increases 
fluids purification products also reported a net sales increase due to higher prices and improved sales in certain overseas markets 
the business to business products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal although prices were higher in fiscal  the price increases did not overcome higher costs and the overall volume decline for the group 
costs in fiscal were up approximately for freight  for packaging and for materials compared to fiscal increased selling and administrative expenses accounted for about a reduction in income 
additional commission expense and a large bad debt charge were recorded in fiscal retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  reported in fiscal the growth was driven by sales of private label cat litter 
private label cat litter net sales were up compared to fiscal due to price increases and higher volume 
the volume increase was due to both new distribution and new product offerings 
net sales of synthetic based industrial absorbents were up due to higher selling prices 
our clay based floor absorbent net sales increased due to higher prices which overcame a decline in volume 
our canadian operation s total net sales increased in fiscal the canadian net sales increase was driven by private label cat litter products due to higher prices and new products 
better management of trade promotions during fiscal also increased net sales for the group 
partially offsetting these sales increases was a reduction in branded cat litter net sales due to lower volume 
the retail and wholesale products group s operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal price increases  trade promotion changes and lower packaging costs overcame higher freight costs 
packaging costs were approximately lower than fiscal due to procurement cost savings initiatives 
material costs in fiscal were up slightly with the prior year 
freight costs were up approximately compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from in fiscal price increases  trade promotion changes and other cost savings initiatives were implemented in an attempt to bring our margins back to more historical levels 
although freight and material costs continued to rise  packaging costs decreased in fiscal due to procurement cost savings efforts 
further contributing to the improved gross profit was a decrease in the cost of fuel used in the manufacturing process in fiscal compared to fiscal  however  non fuel manufacturing costs rose approximately  which had a negative impact on gross profit 
non fuel manufacturing costs increased for repairs  labor  electricity and other raw materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from the reported in fiscal the increase in fiscal expenses was primarily due to an increase in expenses for the estimated discretionary incentive bonus  audit fees  stock based compensation and bad debt 
the higher incentive bonus expense was based on the improved results in fiscal additional audit expense was incurred to comply with the internal control reporting requirements mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of now that we have met the accelerated filer market capitalization threshold 
stock based compensation expense increased due to the additional expense recorded relating to the stock split as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
bad debt expense in fiscal included the write off of a receivable from a sports product customer 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were lower due to a gain on sale of water rights described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense for fiscal increased  from fiscal due to the new debt issuance described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the new debt issuance on december  was outstanding for twelve months in fiscal and for only seven and a half months in fiscal interest income in fiscal increased  from fiscal due to increased interest rates in the market and increased average investment balances 
other income in fiscal increased  from fiscal due to insurance proceeds on life insurance policies on former employees and royalty income from the use of a trademark 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal versus in fiscal the tax expense for fiscal included a  tax impact for the repatriation of previously accumulated untaxed foreign earnings and profits  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding this additional tax expense  our fiscal effective tax rate would have been  which is consistent with the rate for fiscal total assets increased  or  during fiscal current assets increased  or  from the fiscal year end balances due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
these changes are described in liquidity and capital resources below 
conversely  prepaid overburden removal decreased due to the  pre tax write off upon implementation of eitf described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in investments in treasury securities is due to timing of transfers to investments from cash and cash equivalents 
inventories decreased due to a concerted effort to reduce packaging inventory levels  lower fuel inventory and cost reduction initiatives 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  from the year end balance in fiscal vehicles increased due to the purchase of motor equipment used in mining operations and land increased due to the purchase of mining property 
buildings  machinery  equipment and office furniture decreased due to a comprehensive fixed asset inventory which resulted in a write off of assets and their corresponding accumulated depreciation 
the write offs had no significant financial impact because most assets were fully depreciated 
construction in progress decreased as a large project in process at fiscal year end was placed in service during fiscal total liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal noncurrent liabilities decreased  mostly due to payment on long term debt 
current liabilities increased  or  during fiscal  due to an increase in accrued salaries 
accrued salaries included a higher incentive bonus accrual based on the improved financial results for fiscal the audit expense accrual  included in other accrued expenses  was higher due to additional expense to comply with the internal control reporting requirements mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of now that we have become an accelerated filer  however  lower accruals relating to packaging and fuel inventories offset the audit accrual increase resulting in an overall decrease in other accrued expenses 
in addition  accrued trade spending decreased due to timing and reduction of promotions 
accounts payable also decreased due to normal timing of payments and reduction of packaging inventory levels 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal net income for the year was  a decrease of from net income of  in fiscal diluted income per share was 
in fiscal  versus 
in fiscal fiscal net income was positively impacted by a increase in net sales for the business to business products group and an increase in net sales for the retail and wholesale products group 
these sales improvements were driven by growth in both tons sold and price increases 
overall  we reported a total tons sold increase in fiscal compared to fiscal also  positively impacting net income for the year was a  gain on the sale of long lived assets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this gain 
negatively impacting the results for fiscal were substantial material  packaging  freight and manufacturing cost increases 
the impact of the cost increases were experienced by both our domestic and foreign operations 
the cost increases were greater than the net sales increases described above and particularly impacted the retail and wholesale products group 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  from net sales of  in fiscal strong sales growth was seen in agricultural chemical carriers  co manufactured and fluids purification products 
agricultural chemical carrier net sales increased due to higher prices and higher volumes 
in fiscal  agricultural chemical carrier volumes were particularly low due to customers using inventory carried over from the prior year and due to increasing acceptance of genetically modified and treated seed in the market 
in fiscal  sales volume rebounded as customer inventory levels returned to normal  however genetically modified seed continued to erode the market for these carriers 
the increase in agricultural chemical carrier production also increased the availability of the group s flo fre product line  which in turn caused a further increase in net sales 
co manufactured products net sales increased due to price increases 
fluids purification products reported a net sales increase due to price increases and higher volumes 
bleaching earth and filtration products benefited from sales efforts to increase their presence in the marketplace by increasing sales staff 
price competition remains intense for these products due to international edible oil processors contracting globally to leverage buying power 
sports products net sales were consistent with fiscal animal health and nutrition products net sales were down due to lower volume 
the warm winter weather and a declining chicken market due to avian bird flu concerns resulted in lower sales of poultry guard 
conditionade net sales were down as competition intensified  however  we believe our mycotoxin expertise and increased focus on mycotoxin issues worldwide will drive increased sales of conditionade in the future 
the business to business products group s operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increased sales in agricultural chemical carriers  bleaching earth and filtration and co manufactured products described above contributed significantly to the increase in income 
partially offsetting the increased sales were increased manufacturing and freight costs 
material costs increased  packaging costs increased and freight costs increased 
higher selling and administrative expense increases accounted for about a reduction in income 
retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  reported in fiscal the growth was driven by sales of both branded and private label cat litters and industrial floor absorbent products 
net sales of branded cat litter increased 
our branded scoopable litter products drove the sales growth with a increase due to price increases and higher volume 
the higher volumes were driven by increases in existing base business  new distribution and new product offerings 
private label cat litter net sales were up in fiscal due to price increases and a volume increase 
our canadian operation s total net sales increased in fiscal  which was driven by private label cat litter products due to expanded distribution and price increases 
net sales of floor absorbents also increased due to price increases 
the retail and wholesale products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal driving the segment s income decline was a increase in packaging costs  a increase in material costs and a increase in freight costs 
transportation and manufacturing fuel costs and resin prices have increased as the cost of oil has increased 
bag stock costs have increased with the price of paper 
selling price increases offset some of the increased freight  packaging and materials costs 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal freight  materials  fuel and packaging cost increases drove the decline in gross profit 
non fuel manufacturing costs rose per manufactured ton  which had a negative impact on gross profit 
also  as fuel costs increased  so did the cost of other utilities  services contract mining and hauling and repair parts used to maintain facilities 
the cost of fuel used in the manufacturing processes increased per manufactured ton on a full year basis  despite our forward purchase program 
overall volume and price increases were insufficient to compensate for the change in the key cost factors 
general price increases and volume growth in agricultural chemical carriers  bleaching earth and filtration and co manufactured products positively impacted the results 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from the reported in fiscal operating expenses in fiscal include stock based compensation expense of  due to the implementation of fas r share based payments  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and a  gain on sale of long lived assets 
operating expenses in fiscal were adversely impacted by approximately  of costs associated with our sarbanes oxley section readiness effort 
excluding these items  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal would remain at and fiscal would have been 
the decrease in fiscal operating expense was driven by a reduction in bonus expense and a reduction in research and development costs 
the reduction in research and development costs was due to a department reorganization that resulted in reduced headcount and a refocus of research efforts 
interest expense for fiscal increased  from fiscal due to the new debt issuance described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income increased  from fiscal due to increased interest rates in the market and increased investment balances 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal versus in fiscal the tax expense for fiscal included a  tax impact for the repatriation of previously accumulated untaxed foreign earnings and profits as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding this additional tax expense  our effective tax rate would have been  which was consistent with the rate for fiscal total assets increased  or  during fiscal current assets increased  or  from the fiscal year end balances 
all categories of current assets increased  with the largest increases in investments in securities  inventories  accounts receivable  and cash and cash equivalents 
the changes in accounts receivables and cash and investments are described in liquidity and capital resources 
inventories increased due to the higher cost of materials and increased tons in ending inventory 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  or  from the year end balance in fiscal all categories of property  plant and equipment increased  with the largest increase in machinery and equipment 
total liabilities increased  or  during fiscal current liabilities increased  or  during fiscal  primarily due to increases in accounts payable  other accrued expenses and current notes payable 
the increases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses are primarily related to the increase in energy and packaging costs as well as increased sales 
accrued interest also increased due to the new debt 
the increase in current notes payable is related to the scheduled payment of debt 
non current liabilities increased  or 
the primary reason for this increase was that notes payable increased due to the  new debt issuance  described in note of the notes of the consolidated financial statements  offset by payments on debt made during the year 
the accruals for pension and other postretirement benefits were also higher at the end of fiscal foreign operations net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  or of total company net sales 
this represents an increase of  or  from fiscal  in which foreign subsidiary net sales were  or of total company net sales 
this increase in net sales was seen in our canadian subsidiary  while our united kingdom subsidiary s net sales were flat with fiscal our canadian subsidiary s net sales increase was driven by private label cat litter products 
the introduction of new products and higher prices improved private label cat litter sales 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported net income of  an increase of  from the  net income reported in fiscal price increases helped overcome higher costs in both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july   were  compared to  as of july  most of the increase in identifiable assets was in cash and cash equivalents 
net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  or of total company net sales 
this represents an increase of  or  from fiscal  in which foreign subsidiary net sales were  or of total company sales 
this increase in sales was seen in both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
our canadian subsidiary s sales net increase was driven by private label cat litter products 
expanded distribution and price increases contributed to part of this increase 
offsetting some of this increase in canada was a decline in industrial products net sales due to weaker industrial economic conditions in the market 
the increase in our united kingdom subsidiary s net sales was partially driven by new customers for that location 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported net income of  a reduction of  from the  net income reported in fiscal the reduction to net income for the year was driven by increased material  freight and packaging costs in our canadian subsidiary 
both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries faced material sourcing issues which contributed to part of the material cost increases 
escalating energy costs accounted for much of the rest of the increase 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july   were  compared to  as of july  most of the decrease in identifiable assets was in cash and cash equivalents 
certain investments were liquidated to facilitate the repatriation of previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  the purchasing and upgrading of real estate  equipment and facilities  and investing in infrastructure and potential acquisitions 
we principally have used cash generated from operations and  to the extent needed  issuance of debt securities and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund these requirements 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled   and  at july   and  respectively 
as of july   there were no outstanding borrowings under our  revolving credit facility with harris na the following table sets forth certain elements of our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands fiscal year ended july  july  july  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in provided by financing activities   effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operations increased  in fiscal to  the increase was primarily due to increases in net income during fiscal  sale of fixed assets  non cash stock compensation expense  deferred income taxes and other non cash charges and changes in working capital 
net cash provided by operations decreased  to  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in net income during fiscal  other non cash charges and changes in working capital 
for fiscal years  and the primary components of working capital that impacted operating cash flows were as follows accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the increase was due to strong fiscal fourth quarter net sales which were higher than fiscal fourth quarter net sales 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  at fiscal year end increased by  compared to fiscal year end the increase was due to net sales in fiscal fourth quarter which were higher than fiscal fourth quarter net sales 
inventories decreased at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end by  due to a concerted effort to reduce packaging inventory levels  lower fuel inventory and procurement cost reduction initiatives 
inventories increased at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end by  reflecting higher cost of materials and fuel and increased tons in ending inventory 
prepaid overburden removal expense was zero at fiscal year end as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we wrote off the august  balance of our prepaid overburden removal expense account to opening retained earnings 
beginning in fiscal  production stripping costs have been treated as a variable inventory production cost and are included in cost of sales in the period they are incurred 
prepaid overburden removal expense was  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end  under the prior accounting principle  due to different amounts of non usable material that needed to be removed from the various sites 
accounts payable decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due to timing of payments 
accrued expenses increased  due to a higher incentive bonus accrual at fiscal year end based on the improved financial results for the year 
the audit expense accrual was also higher due to additional expense to comply with the internal control reporting requirements mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of now that we have met the accelerated filer market capitalization threshold 
partially offsetting these increases were lower accrued expense for packaging and fuel due to the lower inventory levels and a decrease in accrued trade spending 
accounts payable and other accrued expenses increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due to increased energy and packaging costs 
net cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal versus  in fiscal capital expenditures were  lower in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal included a large project to increase plant production capacities 
during fiscal  net dispositions of investment securities were  during fiscal  cash available from new long term debt financing was used for net purchases of debt and investment securities of  cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal capital expenditures were  and net dispositions of debt and investment securities were  in fiscal net cash used in provided by financing activities cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal cash was used in fiscal primarily for principal payments on long term debt and to pay dividends 
both of these amounts were higher than similar payments in fiscal in addition  proceeds from issuance of treasury and common stock during fiscal were lower compared to fiscal due to less stock option exercise activity 
during fiscal   was provided by proceeds from issuance of long term debt  however  this cash inflow was partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock of  there were no significant repurchases of common stock in fiscal in fiscal  cash used in financing activities was  in addition to principal payments on long term debt and dividends   was spent to repurchase common stock 
proceeds from issuance of treasury stock and common stock relating to stock option exercises during fiscal were  other total cash and investment balances held by our foreign subsidiaries at july   and were   and  respectively 
certain investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were liquidated in fiscal to facilitate the repatriation of previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we received cash grants of approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal from the state of illinois 
the money from these grants was used to enhance processing capabilities at our mounds  illinois production facility 
these funds were accounted for on a net grant accounting basis  therefore they were not shown as a cash in flow or a capital expenditure outflow 
the grant funds were completely utilized at the end of the fiscal year in which they were received 
as part of the normal course of business  we guarantee certain debts and trade payables of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
these arrangements are made at the request of the subsidiaries creditors  as separate financial statements are not distributed for the wholly owned subsidiaries 
as of july   the value of these guarantees was  of short term liabilities   of lease liabilities and  of long term debt 
our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
the tables in the following subsection summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  for the timeframes indicated 
we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement with harris n 
a on january   pursuant to which we may borrow up to  from time to time 
our payment obligations under this credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions including a limitation on capital expenditures  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to acquire or dispose of assets 
the agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of july   we had  available under this credit facility and were in compliance with our covenants 
we believe that cash flow from operations  availability under our revolving credit facility and current cash and investment balances will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
our ability to fund operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements  including  but not limited to  the credit agreement  depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt     interest on long term debt     operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations   we are not required to make a contribution to our defined benefit pension plan in fiscal we have not presented this obligation for future years in the table above because the funding requirement can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
amount of commitment expiration per period total other commercial amounts less than commitments committed year years years after years standby letters of credit   other commercial commitments   total commercial commitments   the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
as of july   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
annually we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies stated in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include promotional programs  allowance for doubtful accounts  prepaid overburden  pension accounting and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
stock split effected by a stock dividend 
our board announced a stock dividend on june   during our fiscal year the stock dividend was paid in fiscal  on september   to stockholders of record at the close of business on august  accordingly  shares outstanding  income loss per share  dividends per share  common stock price ranges and balance sheet values for all years presented have been restated to reflect the five for four stock split effected by a stock dividend of one quarter share for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock and the adjustment to aggregate par value has been made 
trade receivables 
trade receivables are recognized when the risk of loss and title pass to the customer consistent with the revenue recognition policy 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and a periodic review of our accounts receivable  including a review of the overall aging of accounts and analysis of specific accounts 
a customer is determined to be uncollectible when we have completed our internal collection procedures  including termination of shipments  direct customer contact and formal demand of payment 
while management believes our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  the unanticipated default by a customer with a material trade receivable could occur 
we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at july  and  respectively 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
we perform a detailed review of our inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review surveys all of our operating facilities and sales divisions to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends are considered 
the allowance not only considers specific items  but also takes into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
the inventory obsolescence reserve values at july  and were  and  respectively 
the lower fiscal reserve is due to a concerted effort to reduce inventory levels and to identify and dispose of obsolete inventory 
prepaid overburden removal and mining costs 
we mine sorbent materials on property that we either own or lease as part of our overall operations 
a significant part of our mining cost is incurred during the process of removing the overburden non usable material from the mine site  thus exposing the sorbent material that is then used in a majority of our production processes 
as of august   we adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry eitf no 
 which changed our reporting of post production stripping costs 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  production costs were treated as a variable inventory production cost and were included in cost of sales in the period they were incurred 
we had  of prepaid expense recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of july  in accordance with the transition guidance provided by this new pronouncement  on august   we wrote off the balance of our prepaid overburden removal expense account to opening retained earnings  with no charge to current earnings 
the results for prior periods have not been restated 
the cumulative effect adjustment reduced opening retained earnings by  eliminated the  balance of the prepaid overburden removal expense account and adjusted our tax accounts by  prior to fiscal  the cost of the overburden removal was recorded in a prepaid expense account and  as the usable sorbent material was mined  the prepaid overburden removal expense was amortized over the estimated available material 
to determine the value of prepaid overburden  our mining personnel survey the individual mining areas 
the estimation work is conducted utilizing a combination of manual and computerized survey tools 
once the survey data is recorded  it is charted on numerous topographical maps of the mining areas 
finally  estimates are developed based on the survey data  maps and professional judgment of the mining engineers 
in fiscal  under eitf no 
 we recorded approximately  in stripping costs 
in fiscal we amortized to current expense approximately  of previously recorded prepaid expense 
the new expense recognition methodology under eitf no 
resulted in approximately  less expense recognized in fiscal additionally  it is our policy to capitalize the purchase cost of land and mineral rights  including associated legal fees  survey fees and real estate fees 
the costs of obtaining mineral patents  including legal fees and drilling expenses  are also capitalized 
pre production development costs on new mines and any prepaid royalties that may be offset against future royalties due upon extraction of the mineral are also capitalized 
all exploration related costs are expensed as incurred 
reclamation 
during the normal course of our overburden removal activities we perform on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill older sites 
this process allows us to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability of the reclamation process 
on an annual basis we evaluate our potential reclamation liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and with fasb interpretation no 
as amended  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
as of july  and  we have recorded an estimated net reclamation asset of  and  respectively  and a corresponding estimated reclamation liability of  and  respectively 
these values represent the discounted present value of the estimated future mining reclamation costs at the production plants 
the reclamation assets are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the various mines 
the reclamation liabilities are increased based on a yearly accretion charge  once again over the estimated useful lives of the mines 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in the future could differ from estimated amounts 
future changes to environmental laws could increase the extent of reclamation work required 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amount incurred for reclamation costs 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue  expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
our impairment analysis is performed in the first quarter of the fiscal year and we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological changes  competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 
our analysis in the first quarter of fiscal did not indicate any impairment 
we continue to monitor events  circumstances or changes in the business that might imply a reduction in value and might lead to impairment 
trade promotions and advertising 
we routinely commit to one time or on going trade promotion programs in our retail and wholesale products group 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers  such as coupons  and sales incentives made to customers  such as slotting  discounts based on sales volume  cooperative marketing programs and other arrangements 
all such trade promotion costs are netted against sales 
promotional reserves are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
to estimate trade promotion reserves  we rely on our historical experience with trade spending patterns and that of the industry  current trends and forecasted data 
while management believes our promotional reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made  estimated amounts could differ from future obligations 
advertising costs include printed materials  participation in industry conventions and shows and market research

stock based compensation 
on august  we adopted financial accounting standards fas no 
r share based payments fas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fas r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for generally all share based payment transactions with employees 
fas r requires that the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
we adopted the pronouncement using a modified prospective application 
under this application  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
the fair value of stock based compensation was estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
this method requires management to make certain estimates  including estimating the expected term of stock options  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized share based compensation expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  net of related tax effect 
this includes expense related to stock option grants and amortization of restricted stock 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we had applied accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related other interpretations to account for our stock option plans 
under apb  we applied the intrinsic value method 
all of the outstanding options issued under the plans had exercise prices equal to the market value on the day of issue 
accordingly  we did not record any compensation expense associated with our issuance of stock options 
had we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  we would have reported approximately  additional employee compensation expense net of related tax effect in fiscal year see note of the notes of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension and postretirement benefit costs 
our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models 
in order to measure the expense and obligations  we must make a variety of estimates including two critical assumptions for the discount rate used to value certain liabilities and the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience 
as these assumptions change from period to period  recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate is based on a market benchmark rate that is of comparable duration to the plan s liabilities 
specifically  the discount rate was based on the citigroup pension liability index 
the rate was rounded to the nearest basis points 
our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of plan assets  which is the fair market value 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations and historical experience 
the expected long term rate of inflation and risk premiums for the various asset categories are based on general historical returns and inflation rates 
the target allocation of assets is used to develop a composite rate of return assumption 
as of july   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
sfas no 
is an amendment of sfas nos 
   and r and is intended to improve financial reporting of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
this statement requires employers to a recognize the funded status of a benefit plan  determined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation  as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position  b recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost  c measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end  which we have used historically  and d include additional disclosures in the notes to the financial statements about effects on net periodic benefit cost that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations 
see note of the notes of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the impact of implementing this pronouncement 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we determine our current and deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the tax effect of the reversal of tax differences is recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  we must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings and other factors that could effect the realization of deferred tax assets 
we recorded valuation allowances for income taxes of  and  at july  and  respectively 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements

the provisions of this statement are effective at the beginning of our fiscal year ending july  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities

unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements relating to items measured at fair value 
the provisions of this statement are to be applied prospectively and are effective at the beginning of our fiscal year ending july  we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  president bush signed into law the pension protection act of  which will affect the manner in which we administer our defined benefit pension plan 
this legislation requires  among other things  one set of funding rules for determining minimum required contributions to defined benefit plans based on a comparison of the plan s assets to the plan s liabilities  higher premium payments to the pension benefit guaranty corporation by sponsors of defined benefit plans  plan document amendments and additional plan disclosures in regulatory filings and to plan participants 
this legislation will be effective for plan years beginning after december   with certain transition rules for through we are currently assessing the impact that it may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with sfas no

fin also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we expect to implement fin no 
for our first quarter of fiscal year we are currently reviewing this pronouncement  but we believe it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and employ policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of july  we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not material 
we are exposed to currency risk as it relates to certain accounts receivables and our foreign operations 
we believe that the currency risk is immaterial to the overall presentation of the financial statements 
we are exposed to regulatory risk in the fluid purification and agricultural markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain in the united states and europe 
we actively monitor developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which we are a member 
we are exposed to commodity price risk with respect to fuel 
we plan to contract for approximately half of our fuel needs for fiscal using forward purchase contracts to manage the volatility in fuel prices related to this exposure 
all contracts are related to the normal course of business and no contracts are entered into for speculative purposes 
the weighted average cost of our natural gas contracts has been estimated to be approximately higher than the contracts for fiscal the following table provides information about our natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts  the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on september  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected maturity fair value natural gas future volumes mmbtu  weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands   factors that could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the creditworthiness of our natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  and the general demand for natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed us to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts by the continued  and in some cases expanded  use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on our fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market
