item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following management discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
this md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
we are an independent designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components  modules and systems for the automotive  medium and heavy duty truck  agricultural and off highway vehicle markets 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for our operating results were favorably affected by a number of items  including improved operational performance at our united kingdom facility and increased commercial vehicle volumes in north america and europe 
our results were also favorably impacted by a million pretax reduction in our restructuring expense and a million pretax reduction in our bad debt expense 
furthermore  our pst ind stria eletr nica da amaz nia ltda 
pst joint venture in brazil continued to perform well  resulting in equity earnings of million compared with million in the previous year 
these benefits were mitigated by a number of challenging industry wide issues  including intense competition  product price reductions  and higher commodity costs 
we continuously work to address these challenges by implementing a broad range of initiatives aimed to improve operating performance 
during  we employed teams to implement best practices in our underperforming operations and focused our purchasing initiatives to reduce material procurement costs 
our operational improvements and working capital management yielded a million increase in cash flow from operating activities increased to million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
on july  we announced that we would begin work on our second major instrument panel assembly contract for the north american commercial vehicle market 
production is expected to begin in the first quarter of and the contract is expected to contribute net sales of approximately million annually at full production 
it is currently anticipated that the program will reach full production levels by in  management expects a significant decline in north american production for medium and heavy trucks as more stringent diesel emissions standards become effective in the us we expect our overall sales decline will be less than the industry production decline because our second instrument panel award and stable demand outside the us partially offsets reduced north american medium and heavy duty truck production 
our expected performance will be based on our continued drive toward operational excellence across the organization  ongoing cost reduction initiatives and successful launches of several key products in significant factors inherent to our markets that could affect our results for include the financial stability of our customers and suppliers as well as our ability to successfully execute our planned productivity and cost reduction initiatives 
we are undertaking these initiatives to mitigate commodity price increases and customer demanded price reductions 
as part of these programs  we have implemented a nonspeculative hedging program to reduce our exposure to copper price fluctuations 
our results for also depend on conditions in the automotive and commercial vehicle industries  which are generally dependent on domestic and global economies 
going forward  we look to continue our transition to low cost manufacturing locations 
initially  this initiative may result in restructuring costs stemming from facility closures and production relocations 
however  the longer term effects of such an initiative will enable us to reduce our operating costs and provide global sourcing capacity to our customers 
results of operations we are primarily organized by markets served and products produced 
under this organization structure  our operations have been aggregated into two reportable segments vehicle management power distribution and control devices 
the vehicle management power distribution reportable segment includes results of operations from our operations that primarily design and manufacture electronic instrument clusters  electronic control units  driver information systems and electrical 
table of contents distribution systems  primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for electrical power and signal distribution 
the control devices reportable segment includes results of operations from our operations that primarily design and manufacture electronic and electromechanical switches  control actuation devices and sensors 
beginning in  we changed from a calendar year end to a week fiscal year end 
since then  our fiscal quarters were comprised of week periods 
on october   we changed back to a calendar december fiscal year end  and therefore the fiscal year ended on december  our fiscal quarters are now comprised of three month periods 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales for our reportable segments  excluding inter segment sales  for the fiscal years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the fiscal years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease vehicle management power distribution control devices total net sales the increase in net sales for our vehicle management power distribution segment was primarily due to increased sales to our commercial vehicle customers because north american demand was strong during the year 
the most significant factor behind the increase in demand is related to the implementation of more stringent diesel emissions standards in the us overall commercial vehicle demand increased in in anticipation of the emission changes 
as of result of this pull ahead in demand  we expect a substantial decline in north american demand in in addition to the north american volume increase  our revenues also increased as a result of new product sales in europe and a million impact from foreign currency exchange rates for the year 
net sales for our control devices segment declined as a result of lower production volumes at the traditional domestic automakers and product price reductions 
these declines were partially offset by new product sales in our european operations 
for the full year  the control devices segment was impacted by million from favorable foreign currency exchange 
net sales by geographic location for the fiscal years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the fiscal years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease north america europe and other total net sales the increase in north american sales was primarily attributable to increased sales to our commercial vehicle customers as a result of strong north american demand 
the increase was substantially offset by unfavorable north american light vehicle production and product price reductions 
the increase in sales outside north america was primarily due to new product revenues and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales outside north america by million for the fiscal year ended december  
table of contents consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years ended december  and are presented in the following table in thousands for the fiscal years ended december  increase decrease net sales costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative provision for doubtful accounts gain on sale of property  plant equipment  net restructuring charges operating income interest expense  net equity in earnings of investees other income loss  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income cost of goods sold 
this decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was predominately due to operational improvements and increased sales volume 
offsetting these factors were unfavorable material price variances resulting from raw material price increases and product price reductions 
we expect that pricing and raw material price challenges will continue to affect our gross margin into our management team is working to offset these pressures through our focused operational improvement efforts  commodity hedging and purchasing programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in non product development sg a expenses in compared with is primarily attributable to the increase in sales and infrastructure costs related to a new product launch and costs related to a consulting agreement for a former employee 
these increases were partially offset by a million one time gain related to the settlement of the life insurance benefits portion of a postretirement benefit plan 
during  our sg a costs benefited from non recurring legal and commercial settlements 
product development expenses included in selling  general and administrative sg a were million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
in the future  the company intends to reallocate its resources to focus on the design and development of new products rather than focusing on sustaining existing product programs for specific customers 
provision for doubtful accounts 
the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts was primarily a function of bad debt charges associated with customer bankruptcies in exceeding the bad debt charges associated with customer bankruptcies in restructuring charges 
in january  we announced that we would undertake restructuring efforts related to the rationalization of certain manufacturing facilities in europe and north america 
the restructuring is a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
the decrease in restructuring charges was a result of the substantial completion of our previously announced restructuring initiatives 
interest expense  net 
the decrease in interest expense  net was primarily due to an increase in interest income in interest income in and was million and million  respectively 
this increase was related to a million past due interest payment from pst and increased interest generated from our cash and cash equivalents

the increase in equity in earnings of investees was predominately attributable to the increase in equity earnings recognized from our pst joint venture in brazil 
the increase primarily reflects higher volume for pst s security and electric power component product lines 

table of contents other income loss  net 
the decrease in other income was primarily the result of unfavorable foreign exchange contract variances 
the decrease was offset by a million gain on the sale of our partnership interest in industrial development associates ida 
income before income taxes 
income before income taxes is summarized in the following table by reportable segment in thousands for the fiscal years ended december  increase decrease vehicle management power distribution control devices other corporate activities corporate interest expense income before income taxes the increase in income before income taxes at the vehicle management power distribution reportable segment was primarily the result of increased sales volume  a reduction in bad debt expense  and operational improvements 
offsetting these gains were unfavorable raw material purchase price variances and product price reductions 
the increase in income before income taxes at the control devices reportable segment was primarily the result of improved operating efficiencies at our united kingdom operation and a reduction in restructuring and bad debt expenses 
these factors were partially offset by ongoing product price reductions and increased raw material costs 
income before income taxes by geographic location for the fiscal years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the fiscal years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease north america europe and other income before income taxes the increase in our profitability in north america was primarily attributable to increased north american commercial vehicle volume and lower bad debt expenses 
the positive variance was partially offset by unfavorable raw material variances and product price reductions 
the increase in our profitability outside north america was primarily due to the operational improvement at our united kingdom operations  which experienced significant operational inefficiencies in  and increased sales volume 
these improvements were partially offset by costs related to the start up of our suzhou  china  manufacturing facility 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recognized a provision for income taxes of million  or of pre tax income  and million  or of the pre tax income  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in pre tax earnings and a corresponding reduction in the amount of additional valuation allowance needed that resulted from the improved performance of our united kingdom operations

the increase also reflects increased sales and marketing activity partially offset by decreased sarbanes oxley compliance expenses 
provision for doubtful accounts 
the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts was primarily a function of bad debt charges associated with customer bankruptcies in exceeding the bad debt charges associated with customer bankruptcies in restructuring charges

provision benefit for income taxes 
we recognized a provision benefit for income taxes of million  or of pre tax income  and million  or of the pre tax loss  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective rate for the fiscal year ended december  compared to was attributable to net operating loss carryforwards and certain other deferred tax assets in the united kingdom that required a full valuation allowance in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to improvements in net income and lower working capital levels 
our cash management strategy of better matching our suppliers terms with our customers terms increased our accounts payable balance and resulted in increased cash flows for net cash used by investing activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used by investing activities of million was attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures during the year 
during  major capital spending initiatives included the launch of new products in the areas of customer actuated switches  power distribution systems and sensor products 
we also invested approximately million for an additional stake in our minda instruments limited minda joint venture  increasing our investment in minda from to 
in  capital and investment spending was offset by million in proceeds from a property sale and million in proceeds from the sale of our partnership interest in ida 
net cash provided used by financing activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily related to proceeds from the exercise of share options  partially offset by cash used for fees related to the completion of our credit agreement amendment during the first quarter 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s senior notes and credit facilities 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the purpose of these investments is to reduce exposure related to our krona and pound denominated receivables 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december  and  per quoted market sources  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s foreign currency option contracts were expired as of december  and  respectively 
as discussed in note  we have entered into a fixed price swap for metric tonnes of copper 
the purpose of these contracts is to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
as of december   the change in value of the commodity swaps was approximately million 
our credit facilities contain various covenants that require  among other things  the maintenance of certain specified ratios of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda  interest coverage and fixed charge coverage 
restrictions also include limits on capital expenditures  operating leases and dividends 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  on march   we amended our credit agreement dated may  the amendment modifies certain financial covenant requirements  changes certain reporting requirements  sets borrowing levels based on certain asset levels and prohibits us from 
table of contents repurchasing  repaying or redeeming any of our outstanding subordinated notes unless certain covenant levels are met 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s senior notes and credit facilities 
the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments  as of december  in thousands 
less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt operating leases employee benefit plans total contractual obligations the company s million senior notes are redeemable in may at 
given the company s senior notes are redeemable in the near future  we may seek to retire the notes through cash purchases  open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such redemptions  purchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
future capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with recent levels and future organic growth is expected to be funded through cash flows from operations 
management will continue to focus on reducing its weighted average cost of capital and believes that cash flows from operations and the availability of funds from our credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our future growth and operating needs 
as outlined in note to our consolidated financial statements  the company is party to a million revolving credit facility 
on march   the company amended the credit agreement  which  among other things  gave the company substantially all of its borrowing capacity on the million credit facility 
as of december   million of the million was available 
inflation and international presence given the current economic climate and recent increases in certain commodity prices  we believe that a continuation of such price increases would significantly affect our profitability 
furthermore  by operating internationally  we are affected by the economic conditions of certain countries 
based on the current economic conditions in these countries  we believe we are not significantly exposed to adverse economic conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on authorized returns and historical trends in sales returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we often enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s expected production life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is our obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation  which may affect product pricing 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our 
table of contents customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses immediately 
these agreements generally may also be terminated by our customers at any time 
on an ongoing basis  we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers  which include pricing terms 
purchase orders do not always specify quantities 
we recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers 
we are asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content  the cost of our products and other commercial factors 
such pricing accruals are adjusted as they are settled with our customers 
warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet dates 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims 
to estimate the warranty reserve  we are required to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
although  we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have concentrations of sales and trade receivable balances with a few key customers 
therefore  it is critical that we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
additionally  we review historical trends for collectibility in determining an estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
we do not have collateral requirements with our customers 
contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal council handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimated that amount of probable loss 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for us inventories and by the first in  first out fifo method for non us inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill on january  in lieu of amortization  this standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the valuation methodologies employed by the company use subjective measures including forward looking financial information and discount rates that directly impact the resulting fair values used to test the company s business units for impairment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill 
share based compensation 
the valuing of our share based compensation awards involves a number of assumptions 
we believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations 
we estimate volatility and forfeitures based on historical data and the expected term of the share based 
table of contents compensation awards 
the assumptions  however  involve inherent uncertainties 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense could have varied 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense 
the expected long term return on assets is determined as a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class held by the defined benefit pension plan at the date 
the expected return on bonds has been based on the yield available on similar bonds by currency  issuer and duration at that date 
the expected return on equities is based on an equity risk premium of return above that available on long term government bonds of a similar duration and the same currency as the liabilities 
discount rates for our defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom are determined using the average long term sterling aa corporate bond 
on december   the yield was approximately  with the individual yields on most of these yields of most of the bonds being within a range of 
discount rates for our other postretirement benefit plan in the us are determined using the moody s aa corporate bond index 
the average equivalent annual rate on a aa corporate bond at december  was 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations 
our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods 
due to the length of the carryover period it is unlikely that the deferred tax assets will expire prior to being utilized 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries  which are deemed permanently reinvested 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and in making this evaluation  the company considers available positive and negative evidence  including past results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent periods  and our forecast of taxable income for the current year and future years 
a valuation allowance may need to be recorded against us deferred tax assets in the event that future us taxable income is materially different than estimated amounts 
the primary risk factor is a more than expected severe downturn in the us automotive and commercial vehicle segments of which the company has significant us operations 
the impact of the risk factor would be offset by raw material cost management and restructuring initiatives which are expected to result in savings in future periods 
recently issued accounting standards new accounting standards to be implemented in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
at december   however  all of our debt was fixed rate debt 
at this time  we do not use financial instruments to manage this risk 
commodity price risk given the current economic climate and the recent increases in certain commodity costs  we currently are experiencing an increased risk  particularly with respect to the purchase of copper  zinc  resins and certain other commodities 
we manage this risk through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered short term contract maturities and commercial negotiations with our suppliers 
in december  we entered into a fixed price swap for metric tonnes of copper 
the purpose of these contracts is to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
the recent increases in certain commodity costs have negatively affected our operating results  and a continuation of such price increases could significantly affect our profitability 
going forward  we believe that our mitigation efforts will offset a substantial portion of the financial impact of these increased costs 
however  no assurances can be given that the magnitude or duration of these increased costs will not have a material impact on our future operating results 
a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in commodity prices would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk our risks related to foreign currency exchange rates have historically not been material  however  given the current economic climate  we are monitoring this risk 
we use derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward and option contracts  to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other known foreign currency exposures 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts that had a notional value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the purpose of these investments is to reduce exposure related to the company s swedish krona and british pound denominated receivables 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december  and  per quoted market sources  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s foreign currency option contracts expired as of december  we do not expect the effects of this risk to be material in the future based on the current operating and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million as of december  a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million as of december  these estimated changes assume a parallel shift in all currency exchange rates and include the gain or loss on financial instruments used to hedge known foreign currency exposures 
because exchange rates typically do not all move in the same direction  the estimate may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on the net fair value of the company s currency derivatives 
it is also important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
therefore  a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted foreign currencies would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
