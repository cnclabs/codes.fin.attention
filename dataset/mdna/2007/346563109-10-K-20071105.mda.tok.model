the company expects to file shortly quarterly reports on form q for the three months ended march  q and the three and six months ended june  q 
the q and q form q s will contain restated financial information for the comparable periods of the prior year 
previously filed annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q have not been amended and should not be relied upon 
see the explanatory note on page of this annual report on form k and footnote to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a further discussion of the restatement of our prior period financial statements 
overview we derive revenues from memberships to our research products and from our advisory services and events available through what we refer to as research  data  consulting  and community offerings 
we offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
clients purchase advisory services offered through our data  consulting and community products and services to supplement their memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event 
consequently  changes in the number and value of client contracts  both net decreases as well as net increases  impact our revenues and other results over a period of several months 
our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  and amortization of intangible assets 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  and it includes the costs of salaries  bonuses  and related benefits for research personnel  non cash stock based compensation expense  and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  non cash stock based compensation expense  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions  and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and strategy groups and our other administrative functions  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  and non cash stock based compensation expense 
overhead costs are allocated over these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
amortization of intangible assets represents the cost of amortizing acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships 
deferred revenue  agreement value  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business 
we believe that the amount of deferred revenue  along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services  provide a significant measure of our business activity 
deferred revenue reflects billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date 
we calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time but not including advisory only contracts  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  we calculate client retention as the number of client companies who renewed with memberships during the most recent twelve 
table of contents month period as a percentage of those that would have expired during the same period 
we calculate dollar retention as a percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period 
we calculate enrichment as a percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts 
client retention  dollar retention  and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
a summary of our key metrics is as follows year ended absolute percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue in millions agreement value in millions client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients at year end year ended absolute percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue in millions agreement value in millions client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients at year end the increase in deferred revenue and agreement value from to is primarily due to increases in the number of clients and in the average contract size 
the average contract for annual memberships for research only at december  was approximately  an increase of from  at december  the average contract for an annual membership for research which also included advisory services at december  was approximately  an increase of from  at december  increases in average contract sizes and enrichment in reflect increasing demand for our products  reduced discounting and increased prices 
the increase in deferred revenue and agreement value from to is primarily due to an increase in the number of clients 
the increase in client retention and dollar retention reflects an improving economic environment 
the decrease in enrichment from to reflects more clients renewing memberships at the same level as the prior year  coupled with an increase in advisory only contracts purchased by clients during the membership term and not in connection with the renewal 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates  including but not limited to  those related to our revenue recognition  non cash stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from licensing our research  performing advisory services  hosting events and conducting teleconferences 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement 
revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values  however  the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions 
research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory service revenues are recognized during the period in which the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable 
forrester teleconferences revenue and reimbursed out of pocket expenses are recorded as advisory service revenues 
events revenues are recognized upon completion of the event 
annual memberships which include access to our research  unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry  unlimited participation in forrester s teleconferences  and the right to attend one event  are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period 
while historical business practice had been to offer contracts with a non cancelable term  effective april   we began offering clients a money back guarantee  which gives clients the right to cancel their membership contracts prior to the end of the contract term 
for contracts that can be terminated during the contract term  refunds would be issued for unused products or services 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses  which are deferred and then recorded as expense as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
non cash stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net income 
to determine the fair value of stock based compensation  sfas no 
r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives and forfeiture rates 
prior to sfas no 
r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb no 
we determined the actual measurement dates for historical stock option grants using the approach described in the explanatory note on page and footnote to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the use of a different approach could have resulted in different measurement dates  with exercise prices that may have resulted in more or less compensation expense to the company 
the company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
the development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting date and stock option exercise dates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the actual stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management makes judgments regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of our customers 
table of contents were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of our customers were to improve  the allowances may be reduced accordingly 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in technology related companies and equity investment funds 
these investments are in companies that are not publicly traded  and  therefore  because no established market for these securities exists  the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies  which consists primarily of reviewing the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we have goodwill and identified intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  we compare the reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates on market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  we have selected november th as the date of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships  research content and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on an accelerated basis which matches the periods in which those cash flows are estimated to be produced 
tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment  which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our identifiable intangible and long lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether intangible assets have been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset 
income taxes 
we have deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards primarily from stock option exercises and the acquisition of giga information group  inc in in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and before the carryforwards expire 
although realization is not assured  based upon the level of our historical taxable income and projections for our future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if our estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward periods are incorrect 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas statement no 
 fin which seeks to reduce the significant diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for 
table of contents income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  upon adoption  the cumulative effect of any changes in net assets resulting from the application of fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we adopted fin in the first quarter of and the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
discontinued operations on september   we completed the sale of our ultimate consumer panel ucp product line to lightspeed online research  inc for million in cash  of which million was paid at the closing date subject to a working capital adjustment  with the remainder due nine months after the closing date 
the sale resulted in a gain on the disposal net of million of income tax expense of million 
the sale included the transfer of certain assets  including all ucp customer contracts  historical data  intellectual property  six employees  and licenses as well as certain liabilities arising in the normal course of business 
forrester sold the product line as it was no longer a strategic fit with its core focus on broad  global business and consumer technology data

the principal purpose of this cash bonus plan was to retain key employees by allowing them to participate in a portion of the potential return from forrester s technology related investments if they remained employed by the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of federal and state government obligations and corporate obligations  with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity except for any future acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in us dollars dollars in thousands fair value at year ending year ending year ending year ending december  december  december  december  december  cash equivalents weighted average interest rate investments weighted average interest rate total portfolio weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange 
on a global level  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
to date  the effect of changes in currency exchange rates has not had a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
accordingly  we have not entered into any hedging agreements 
however  we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations that the euro  or other foreign currencies  will have on foreign exchange exposure if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the total assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets  related to non us dollar denominated currencies were approximately million
