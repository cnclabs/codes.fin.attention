item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction and overview channell commercial corporation the company is a designer and manufacturer of telecommunications equipment supplied to communications network operators worldwide and water storage tanks distributed in consumer markets throughout australia 
major product lines include a complete line of thermoplastic and metal fabricated enclosures  advanced copper termination and connectorization products  fiber optic cable management systems and polyethylene water storage tanks 
the company has two reportable segments  americas and international 
the americas segment includes the company s operations in the united states and canada 
the international segment includes the company s operations in australia including the bushman tanks business and the united kingdom 
during the last five years  demand for communications infrastructure equipment has fluctuated dramatically 
at various times in the past there have been significant slowdowns in capital spending by both cable and telecom network operators due to several factors including  but not limited to  service provider consolidation  delays in outside plant upgrade rebuild projects  and enhancing free cash flow to strengthen their balance sheets and pay down debt 
these changes have had a significant negative impact on overall demand for infrastructure products  and at various times have directly reduced demand for the company s products and increased price competition within its industry  which has led to reductions in the company s revenues and contributed to the company s reported operating losses 
within the water storage portion of the company s business  demand continues to grow in australia due to the country s generally arid climate and the widespread water conservation efforts 
demand for the company s water storage products is also driven by regulatory factors at the local  state  and federal government levels 
periods of significant rainfall could negatively affect the sales of the company s product 
within both the communications infrastructure market and water storage market  the historically high price of petroleum based commodities has had a negative impact on the company s gross margins 
the products manufactured in both of the markets in which the company operates are primarily composed of polyethylene resins  which are primarily derived from commodities such as oil and natural gas 
the company is limited in its ability to pass on incremental price increases to its customers 
continued petroleum based commodity price increases would have a negative impact on the company s performance 
the company continues to invest in the development of new communications infrastructure products and water storage tanks and believes that in both markets it has the leading product portfolios in terms of performance and features 
the company measures its success by monitoring net sales and gross margins with a near term goal of maintaining positive cash flows  while striving to achieve long term operating profits 
the company believes that there continue to be long term growth opportunities within both the communications infrastructure equipment and water tank markets
