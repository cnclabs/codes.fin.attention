item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below could be reduced 
timing of the development of the arkansas river water will depend on the timing of connections added to our existing water and wastewater systems along the front range 
we will fund the development of the arkansas river water  much like the other water we own  by using proceeds generated from the sale of taps or connection fees associated with new connections to our system 
in addition to increasing our service capacities  this additional water may present other market opportunities for us to assist existing water providers in solving their long term water supply needs for their existing and new connections 
along the front range  there are over separate independent water providers with varying needs for replacement and new water supplies  which presents an opportunity for us to assist these water providers in meeting their existing and future water needs 
we are working with the flcc and other interested parties in the arkansas river valley to mitigate any impact to the community and to make investments and decisions on farming operations which benefit our water as well as the traditional water users 
if any of our real property is converted to non irrigated uses  we will be required to re vegetate the land to its natural state 
in addition to the arkansas river agreement and the stock pledge agreement with hp a m noted above  we also signed various other agreements with hp a m  including a pledge agreement  whereby the company pledged to hp a m a defined number of flcc shares acquired pursuant to the arkansas river agreement which will be released as the consideration the value of the stock and the tap participation fees paid exceeds certain defined amounts  a property management agreement with hp a m whereby hp a m will manage the real estate leases in exchange for all the rental income from the assumed leases for a period of five years through august   which can be extended under defined circumstances  a registration rights agreement  pursuant to which we granted hp a m one demand right to register  shares of pure cycle common stock and piggyback rights to register an additional  shares of pure cycle common stock hp a m exercised the piggyback rights in july and registered  shares of common stock  and a voting agreement  pursuant to which our president agreed to vote shares of pure cycle common stock owned by him for hp a m s designated board member 

table of contents the rangeview water supply and related agreements our rangeview water supply is located at the lowry range 
the lowry range is owned by the state board of land commissioners the land board  and is located in unincorporated arapahoe county approximately miles southeast of denver and miles south of the denver international airport 
the land board acquired this property in the s and has stated that the lowry range is one of the most valuable pieces of property in its nearly million acre portfolio 
the lowry range encompasses approximately  acres  of which approximately  acres are within our exclusive service area 
in june  the land board entered into a development and management services agreement with australian based lend lease communities  llc see www 
lendlease 
com for more information on lend lease communities for the development of approximately  acres of the lowry range 
of this  acres  we have the exclusive right to provide water and wastewater services to approximately  acres 
we acquired our rangeview water supply in april pursuant to the following agreements i the amended and restated lease agreement the lease between the land board and the rangeview metropolitan district the district  a quasi municipal political subdivision of the state of colorado  ii the agreement for sale of export water between us and the district and iii the service agreement between us and the district for the provision of water service to the lowry range collectively these agreements are referred to as the rangeview water agreements 
the rangeview water supply is a combination of tributary surface water  nontributary groundwater rights  and storage rights associated with the lowry range 
we own the rights to use  acre feet of non tributary groundwater that can be exported off the lowry range to serve area users 
we also have the exclusive rights to use an additional  acre feet of tributary surface water and nontributary groundwater to serve customers on the lowry range 
the export water we own  together with water owned by the land board that we have contracted to utilize under our service agreement  includes over  acre feet of water per year 
based on independent engineering estimates  the  acre feet of water designated for use on the lowry range is capable of providing water service to approximately  sfe units  and the  acre feet of export water we own can serve approximately  sfe units throughout the denver metropolitan region  for a combined service capacity  of our denver based water assets  of approximately  sfe units 
pursuant to the rangeview water agreements we will design  construct  operate and maintain the district s water system to provide water service to customers within the district s service area  namely the lowry range  using approximately  acre feet of water per year located on the lowry range 
this  acre feet of water is dedicated for use specifically on the lowry range per the rangeview water agreements 
in exchange for providing water service to customers within the district s service area  we receive of all amounts received by the district relating to water services  after deducting required royalties to the land board  which initially total approximately of gross revenues received from water sales 
we will also design  finance  construct  operate and maintain the district s wastewater system to provide wastewater service to customers within the district s service area 
in exchange for providing wastewater service  we receive of the district s wastewater tap fees and of the district s monthly wastewater fees  as well as the rights to use or sell the reclaimed water 
on the lowry range  we operate both the water and the wastewater systems during our contract period and the district owns both systems 
however  after  ownership of the water system infrastructure servicing customers on the lowry range reverts to the land board  with the district retaining ownership of the wastewater infrastructure 
off the lowry range  we will use our export water to provide water and wastewater services to our customers  along with the arkansas river water described above  and we plan to own these facilities 
we plan to contract with third parties for the construction of these facilities 

table of contents the sale of export water generates a royalty payment to the land board  which is described in greater detail in the revenues export water customers section below 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of export water are subject to the comprehensive amendment agreement no 
the caa  which is one of the agreements we used to purchase our export water and is more fully described in item critical accounting policies accounting for caa payments and note participating interests in export water in the accompanying financial statements 
arapahoe county fairgrounds agreement for water service we entered into the county agreement in august to design  construct  operate and maintain a water system for  and provide water services to  the arapahoe county fairgrounds the fairgrounds  which was constructed west of the lowry range 
pursuant to the county agreement  we acquired approximately acre feet of water from the county  which we can use in conjunction with our rangeview water supply to supply water to nearby communities 
as of august   we have not received the water rights deed for approximately acre feet of groundwater  which is valued at approximately  therefore  we have not capitalized the cost of this water and will not do so until the satisfactory transfer of this deed 
until the deed is transferred  the value of this water is included under the caption construction proceeds receivable on the balance sheet as the county would be required to pay us this amount in cash if the water rights deed is not transferred to us 
pursuant to the county agreement  the county purchased water taps for sfes for approximately  which was comprised of  in cash and acre feet of water rights valued at approximately  or  per tap 
the county also paid us  or will pay us  approximately million which can be lowered by the value of the acre feet of water rights we agreed to acquire as explained above  or approximately  to design and build certain special facilities as defined below 
we are servicing the fairgrounds using our export water  and therefore  the tap fees we received generated royalty payments to the land board totaling approximately  which was of the net revenues we received from the sale of export water taps in fiscal the agreement with the land board requires royalty payments on export water sales based on the net revenues we receive 
these net revenues are defined as proceeds from the sale of export water less direct and indirect costs  including reasonable overhead charges  associated with the withdrawal  treatment and delivery of export water 
in addition  the tap fees  net of the land board royalty  were subject to the caa 
this resulted in us distributing approximately  of the tap fees received from the county to the escrow agent in september based on our caa ownership at the time  we received back  or of this distribution 
the tap fees we retained were used to construct the wholesale facilities required to provide water service to the fairgrounds 
see also note water  water systems and service agreements in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of the funding of the special facilities at the fairgrounds as well as a proposed amendment to the county agreement 
the construction of the special and wholesale facilities were completed in our fiscal  and we began providing water service to the fairgrounds at the opening of the th annual arapahoe county fair on july  this is when we started recognizing the tap fees and special facilities funding revenue in income as described in the critical accounting policies section in item below and we started depreciating the facilities constructed to serve the fairgrounds 
sky ranch water supply and water service agreements on october   and may   we entered into two water service agreements collectively the sky ranch agreements with the developer of approximately acres of property located miles north of the lowry range along interstate in colorado  known as sky ranch 
under the sky ranch agreements  once the project commences  we are to provide water service to the homes and other buildings that are expected to be built at sky ranch  which could be as high as  sfes 

table of contents as of the date of this filing  we have not received any payments for tap purchases from the developer and have no information on if or when the developer will begin developing the project and purchase water taps from us 
as part of the sky ranch agreements  the developer is required to dedicate approximately acre feet of water to us in exchange for a  per tap credit for the first water taps purchased 
additionally  pursuant to the sky ranch agreements  the developer is required to pay us million for the construction of certain special facilities required to extend service to sky ranch 
as of august   none of this water has been dedicated to us because sky ranch has not yet purchased any water taps  and construction of the special facilities has not occurred so therefore none of the million for construction of the special facilities has been paid 
we also entered into a five year groundwater purchase agreement with sky ranch to acquire the acre feet of denver aquifer groundwater located at sky ranch  with the final  payment due in april as of the date of this filing  we have acquired of this water  or acre feet for payments totaling  the acre feet of water we have acquired from sky ranch  for which we have the water rights deeds  does not have to be used at sky ranch  at our discretion it can be used throughout our target service area 
we have also paid the developer an additional  to acquire the next acre feet of water pursuant to this groundwater purchase agreement  but the developer has not cashed our checks or remitted the water rights deed for this water to us 
therefore  we have not capitalized this acre feet of water purchased as a water asset yet 
in addition to this  sky ranch is required to make annual option payments to us of  and  for the right to use our export water at sky ranch 
as of the date of this filing  we have not received either of the option payments due in fiscal or  and therefore sky ranch is in default on these payments totaling 
notwithstanding sky ranch being in default on its option fees  our service agreements with sky ranch currently remain in effect 
pursuant to the sky ranch agreements  we maintain responsibility to provide water service to up to  single family units at the sky ranch development using the water we have  or expect to acquire  from sky ranch 
continued default by sky ranch on payment of the option fees places the sky ranch development at risk of not being able to use our export water to service development in excess of the  single family units 
there is currently no development occurring at sky ranch and the developer of sky ranch has listed the property for sale 
by combining the acre feet of water to be purchased from the developer of sky ranch together with the acre feet of water already purchased  and the acre feet anticipated to be purchased under the agreement to purchase denver aquifer groundwater  we will have acquired a total of acre feet of water from sky ranch  which we plan to use to provide water service to the first  sfes at sky ranch 
paradise water supply in we acquired the conditional rights to build a  acre foot reservoir to store colorado river tributary water and a right of way permit from the us bureau of land management for property at the dam and reservoir site 
due to the nature of the paradise water rights  the significant development costs of water assets along the western slope  and agreements with other western slope water interests  the use of our paradise water supply is limited to opportunities along the western slope 
while we continue to identify potential new users for these rights  we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to make use of this asset or sell the water profitably 
see discussion of impairment analysis in the critical accounting policies section below 
every six years our paradise water supply is subject to a finding of reasonable diligence review by the water court and the state engineer to determine if we are diligently pursuing the development of the water rights 
during fiscal the water court began the latest review 
in  we completed the due diligence review with the state engineers office and received a finding of reasonable diligence  but only after certain objectors came forward 
the objectors were questioning our anticipated use of the conditional water rights outside of the colorado river basin and the western slope of colorado 
following months of discussions  we reached an agreement with the objectors on our continued development activities as well as certain milestones to be met during our next diligence period for the paradise water supply  and the objectors agreed to remove their objections from the review process 
as a result  we acknowledged that we can only use our paradise water supply in the colorado river basin  we will consider alternative locations for constructing a reservoir  and we agreed the objectors can have the right to lease up to  acre feet of water per year if we develop the paradise water supply 

table of contents revenues we generate revenues predominately from three sources water and wastewater tap fees  construction fees  and monthly service fees 
we negotiate the payment terms for tap fees  construction fees  and other water and wastewater service fees with each developer  builder or municipality before we commit to providing service and before construction of the project begins 
water and wastewater tap fees tap fees are paid by the developer in advance of construction activities 
tap fees are designed to fund construction of the wholesale facilities and defray the acquisition costs of obtaining water rights 
wholesale facilities are facilities we design  construct  operate  maintain and repair 
wholesale facilities serve our entire service area or major regions or portions thereof 
wells  treatment plants  pumping stations  tanks  reservoirs  transmission pipelines  and major sewage lift stations are typical examples of wholesale facilities 
we own the wholesale facilities we construct off the lowry range 
the district owns the wholesale facilities constructed on the lowry range 
pursuant to our rangeview water agreements with the district and the land board  pricing for water tap fees as well as water usage charges described further below is controlled through a market driven pricing mechanism in which our rates and charges may not exceed the average of similar rates and charges of three nearby communities referred to as the rate based districts 
due to increases in tap fees at the rate based districts  effective july   water tap fees increased to  per tap  which is an increase of over the water tap fee of  per sfe 
wastewater tap fees remained unchanged at table a provides a summary of our water tap fees since table a water system tap fees water tap fees per sfe percentage increase developers owning rights to either surface water or groundwater underlying their properties can receive a credit against a portion of their water tap fees if they elect to sell their water to us  which is negotiated at the time of the service agreement 
construction fees the development of water and wastewater systems typically requires the construction of facilities to extend services to an individual development 
in cases where these facilities are not available for use by any other developments  these facilities are classified as special facilities 
special facilities can include items such as infrastructure required during the construction of the permanent water and wastewater systems  transmission pipelines to transfer water from one location to another  temporary storage facilities  etc 
generally we are not responsible for the design and construction of the special facilities  this is typically the developer s responsibility 
however  we are typically responsible for the operation and maintenance of the special facilities upon completion 
we will accept responsibility for the budgeting  design and construction of the special facilities if the developer provides the funding 
if the developer constructs the special facilities  the facilities must be constructed to our design standards  and the developer is required to dedicate the special facilities to us at no charge upon completion 
if we construct the special facilities  we capitalize the construction costs  and upon completion  we own the special facilities 

table of contents if we agree to build the special facilities  the funding received from the developer is deferred until construction is completed and the assets are placed into operation 
at that time  the funding from the developer is recorded as income over the estimated service period  which is the estimated useful life of the assets constructed with those funds 
the depreciation charges for the special facilities are recorded as costs of revenue over the estimated useful life of the assets 
developers are usually responsible for the design and construction of retail facilities  which are facilities that transport water throughout an individual subdivision or community 
retail facilities are constructed pursuant to our design standards and are inspected by our engineers prior to completion 
once we certify that the retail facilities have been constructed in accordance with our design criteria  the developer dedicates the retail facilities to us or to a quasi municipal political subdivision of the state of colorado  such as the district  at no cost 
at sky ranch  the developer is required to dedicate the retail facilities to the district 
we  through our agreements with the district  are then responsible for the operation and maintenance of the retail facilities 
customer facilities consist of water service pipelines  plumbing  meters and other components that carry potable water and reclaimed water from the street to the customer s house and collect wastewater from the customer s house and transfer it to the collection system 
in many cases  portions of the customer facilities are constructed by the developer  again pursuant to our design standards  but are owned and maintained by the customer 
monthly service fees monthly water usage charges are assessed to customers connected to our water system 
the charges are based on actual metered usage each month 
water usage pricing is based on a tiered pricing structure which is based on our rate based districts 
due to increases at our rate based districts  the tiered pricing structure has increased over the past several years as noted in table b below table b tiered pricing structure price per thousand gallons consumption  gallons month base charge per sfe zero to more than to more than revenues are sensitive to timing and volume of water use  meaning the more water used by a customer in a given month  the higher the cost of additional incremental water deliveries to the customer 
based on this  for a typical residential customer using approximately acre feet of water annually  during a typical weather year  water usage fees would approximate per year 
wastewater customers are charged a flat monthly fee of per sfe  or per year per sfe  which was increased on july  from per sfe  an increase of 
we also collect other relatively small fees and charges from residential customers and other end users to cover miscellaneous administrative and service expenses  such as application fees  review fees and permit fees 

table of contents land board royalties and district fees pursuant to the rangeview water agreements  the land board is entitled to royalty payments based on a percentage of revenues earned from water sales that utilize water dedicated for use on the lowry range or export water 
the calculation of royalties depends on whether the customer is located on the lowry range  or elsewhere  and whether the customer is a public or private entity 
in addition  for water sales to customers located on the lowry range  the district is entitled to a fee  which is calculated after the royalty payment to the land board  and the district is entitled to a fee of of our wastewater fees not including wastewater tap fees from customers on the lowry range 
the land board does not receive a royalty from wastewater services 
the rangeview water agreements were written prior to any development of the lowry range or areas outside of the lowry range that could utilize our export water 
the terms of the rangeview water agreements did not fully anticipate the specific circumstances of development that have arisen and might arise in the future as we enter into and negotiate agreements for the sale of export water and the provision of service to the lowry range 
therefore  the rangeview water agreements may not clearly delineate the rights and responsibilities for the forms of transactions that may arise 
we anticipate that we will be required to enter into negotiations with the land board from time to time to clarify the applicability of contract terms to circumstances that were not anticipated at the time we entered into the rangeview water agreements 
we cannot assure you that the outcome of such negotiations will be favorable to us 
lowry range customers for services to customers located on the lowry range  the district collects fees from customers  pays the royalties to the land board  retains its own fee  and remits the remainder to us 
payments from customers who are on the lowry range generate royalties to the land board at a rate of of gross revenues 
when either i metered production of water used on the lowry range in any calendar year exceeds  acre feet or ii  surface acres on the lowry range have been rezoned to non agricultural use  finally platted and water tap agreements have been entered into with respect to all improvements to be constructed on such acreage  the land board may elect  at its option  to receive  in lieu of its royalty payments  of the aggregate net profits generated derived by the district and pure cycle from the sale or other disposition of water on the lowry range 
to date neither of these conditions has been met 
export water customers payments for export water also generate royalty payments to the land board 
these royalties vary depending on a number of factors including whether the customer is a public or private entity 
when we withdraw  treat and deliver the water to the user and incur the costs related to this process  the royalty to the land board is based on our net revenues  which are our gross revenues less costs  including reasonable overhead allocations  incurred as a direct or indirect result of incremental activity associated with the withdrawal  treatment and delivery of export water 
royalties payable to the land board for export water sold escalate based on the amount of net revenue we receive and are lower for sales to a water district or similar municipal or public entity than for sales to a private entity as noted in table c 
table of contents table c royalties for export water sales royalty rate private public net revenues entity entity over  our current operations we operate and maintain a water system that provides water and wastewater services to our customers on the lowry range 
we also designed and constructed a water system that provides export water to the fairgrounds 
during fiscal we delivered approximately million gallons of potable water to our customers  which equates to approximately million gallons per month during the winter and over million gallons per month during the summer 
we also operate a wastewater treatment plant  which we designed and built  that currently has a permitted capacity of  gallons per day and receives about  gallons per day 
we operate and maintain all our water and wastewater facilities with limited assistance from third party contractors 
we design  construct and operate the facilities serving customers on the lowry range and plan to operate this system  together with facilities serving customers in areas outside the lowry range  in a unified manner to capitalize on economies of scale and ensure the most efficient use of our water 
in august  we entered into the county agreement to provide water services to the fairgrounds 
we commenced service to the fairgrounds in july in  we entered into a water service agreement with the state of colorado department of human services to provide water and wastewater services to a juvenile correction facility on the northwestern edge of the lowry range known as the ridge view youth services center 
this system is designed to provide water and wastewater services for approximately sfes 
we commenced service to the ridge view youth services center in significant customers ridge view youth services center and schmidt aggregates provided approximately  and of our total water and wastewater treatment revenues during the years ended august   and  respectively 
our projected operations we design  construct and operate our water and wastewater facilities using advanced cleaning and treatment technologies 
we also design our systems to use our water supplies in an efficient manner 
we plan to develop our water and wastewater systems in stages to meet incremental demands in our service areas 
we will use third party contractors to construct our facilities as needed 
we employ licensed water and wastewater operators to operate our water and wastewater systems 
at full build out  we expect to employ professionals that will operate our systems  read meters  bill customers  and manage our operations 
we plan to take advantage of advanced technologies to keep personnel requirements and operating costs low  such as systems that enable meter readings and billings to be done remotely  reducing associated handling and labor costs 

table of contents we plan to provide an environmentally responsible integrated water management system  as depicted in table d below  that combines conservation efforts with effective water reuse planning and balanced water supply management 
we plan to jointly utilize our surface water rights in the arkansas river  our two surface water streams that flow through the lowry range  deep well waters from our non tributary water supplies and our stored reuse water in our irrigation water system  to provide an efficient  environmentally sound  long term water solution for our customers 
table d our balanced water plan water plan we anticipate initially developing our denver based water supplies located on the lowry range and phasing the development of our arkansas river water as connections are added to our system 
in order to deliver the arkansas river water to the front range market  a mile pipeline will have to be constructed with an estimated cost of over million this includes estimated costs of water treatment facilities 
we are currently reviewing physical alignments and potential partnerships for construction of this pipeline 
converting the arkansas water to municipal use and constructing the pipeline will be a long term process  which will give us the opportunity to work closely with those who might be impacted by any water transfers 
the development of this water will require us to apply for a change of use in the colorado water court which could take many years and require a significant amount of capital 
however  we do not anticipate starting this process in the near term and anticipate that the tap fees and usage fees from taps sold utilizing our rangeview water supply will be sufficient to fund these requirements 
we ultimately anticipate being able to service over  sfe s with the arkansas river water 
we expect the development of our rangeview water supply to require between and high capacity water wells ranging in depth from feet to over  feet 
we anticipate drilling separate wells into each of the three principal aquifers located beneath the lowry range 
each well is intended to deliver water to central water treatment facilities for treatment prior to delivery to customers 
we also intend to build structures to divert surface water to storage reservoirs to be located on the lowry range 
our plan is to divert the surface water when available and  prior to distribution to our customers  to treat the surface water with a separate water treatment facility built specifically to treat surface water 
based on preliminary independent engineering estimates  the full build out of water facilities on the lowry range will cost in excess of million and will accommodate water service from the rangeview water supply for up to  sfe units  which includes both customers located in and outside the lowry range service area 

table of contents rangeview metropolitan district the district is a quasi municipal corporation and political subdivision of colorado formed in for the purpose of providing water and wastewater service to the lowry range 
the district will utilize the  acre feet of water leased to it by the land board located on the lowry range for service to customers on the lowry range 
the district is run by an elected board of directors 
the only eligible voters and the only persons eligible to serve as directors are the owners of property within the boundaries of the district 
we own certain rights to the real property which encompasses the current boundaries of the district 
the current directors of the district are mark w 
harding and scott e 
lehman employees of pure cycle  ryan t 
clark by reason of his role as manager of tpc ventures  llc  ryan clark is deemed an indirect beneficial owner of more than of pure cycle common stock and tom lamm 
we are party to a right of first refusal agreement with the owners of the property comprising the district 
pursuant to a tenancy in common agreement  in the event of death  bankruptcy or incompetence of any tenant  that tenant s estate or representative must offer the property interest of that tenant to the remaining tenants for purchase 
if the remaining tenants do not purchase all of such person s interest  the property must be offered to us pursuant to the right of first refusal agreement 
in addition  if any tenant wants to sell his interest in the parcel  such tenant must find a bona fide buyer and then offer the property to us 
we have the right  at our option  to buy the property by matching the terms of the bona fide third party offer or by paying the appraised value of the property as determined by independent appraisers 
a tenant may also negotiate a sale directly with us if he elects not to locate a bona fide buyer 
each of the directors listed above  as well as pure cycle  currently own an undivided interest in the land comprising the district 
under applicable colorado law  entities are not qualified to serve as directors of municipal districts and may not vote 
our president and corporate secretary serve as elected members of the board of directors of the district 
pursuant to colorado law  directors receive for each board meeting or a maximum of  per year 
we and the board of directors of the district transact business on an arms length basis 
the conflicts of interest of the directors in transactions between us and the district are disclosed in filings with the colorado secretary of state 
the district and we were each represented by separate legal counsel in negotiating the water service agreement and wastewater service agreement between the parties 
the agreements were also approved by the two members of the district s board who were not our employees and by the land board 
it is likely that at some point in the future  the board of directors of the district will be comprised entirely of directors independent from us 
as the land board develops the lowry range  landowners on the lowry range may petition to include their land within the district s boundaries 
provided such petition complies with applicable law  the district is required by its lease with the land board to proceed with due diligence to include the area designated in such petition within the district s boundaries 
as the district s boundaries expand  the base of persons eligible to serve as directors and eligible to vote will also increase 
water and growth in colorado as the population in colorado continues to grow  so does the need for obtaining new water sources 
despite the softening housing market that colorado and the nation have experienced  the us census bureau estimated colorado s population at nearly million  a increase from the census taken in the denver regional council of governments drcog  a voluntary association of over county and municipal governments in the denver metropolitan area  estimates the denver metropolitan area is expected to increase from million people to million people by the year with this estimated population increase comes increased demand for water services beyond what the municipal service providers are currently capable of providing 
it is estimated that the population growth in the denver metropolitan area will require an additional  acre feet of water annually 
this is why the us department of the interior has identified the denver metropolitan area as one region that is highly likely to experience a water supply crisis by 
table of contents with these projected levels of growth  with interest heightened by droughts in colorado  with most of colorado s water being located in the western half of the state while the majority of the population is in the eastern half of the state  water is one of the largest influences on development in colorado 
due to wide fluctuations in snowfall from year to year and area to area  the amount of surface water that can be captured for use varies greatly 
this has lead most water providers in colorado to actively pursue additional water supplies  including the use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation and other non potable uses 
having participated in the department of public health s regulatory rule making process defining water quality standards for reuse water  we have helped lead the effort in the metropolitan area to design water reuse systems and set reuse water quality standards 
in august  the colorado department of public health and environment adopted rules defining water quality standards for raw and reclaimed water uses for residential irrigation customers 
these rules  as applicable  will be incorporated into our rules and regulations 
our master plan for our service area  which includes the lowry range and all other areas in which we will provide services  calls for the installation of a dual pipe water distribution and reclamation system 
a dual pipe distribution system is a system in which one pipe supplies the customer with high quality potable drinking water and a second pipe supplies raw or reclaimed water to homes for irrigation uses 
about one half of the water needed to meet denver area residential water demands is used for landscaping and outdoor irrigation of lawns 
we  along with most major water providers  believe that raw or reclaimed water supplies provide the lowest cost water for irrigation purposes for customers 
we expect to implement an extensive water reclamation system  in which essentially all wastewater treatment plant effluent water will be re used to meet non potable water demands 
this will enhance our ability to provide quality water service and reinforce our philosophy that emphasizes the importance of water recycling and our commitment to environmentally responsible water management policies 
competition although we have exclusive long term water and wastewater service contracts for the majority of the lowry range we currently have the exclusive rights to serve two of the six initial development sections at the lowry range  but are negotiating with the developer to provide services to the entire initial development  providing water service using our export water and arkansas river water is subject to competition 
alternate sources of water are available  principally from other private parties  such as farmers owning senior water rights that are no longer being economically used in agriculture  and municipalities seeking to annex newly developed areas in order to increase their tax base 
our principal competition in areas close to the lowry range is the neighboring city of aurora 
the principal factors affecting competition for potential purchasers of our arkansas river water and export water include the availability of water for the particular purpose  the cost of delivering the water to the desired location and the reliability of the water supply during drought periods 
we believe the water assets we own and have the exclusive rights to use  which have a supply capacity of over  sfe units or roughly  people  provide us a significant competitive advantage along the front range because our legal rights to the assets have been confirmed for municipal use for our rangeview water supply  a significant portion of our water supply is close to denver area water users  our pricing structure is competitive and our water portfolio is well balanced with senior surface rights  groundwater rights  storage capacity and reclamation water 
further  the size of the lowry range and the amount of property that can be served by the arkansas river water and export water will provide us with economies of scale that should give us advantages over our competitors 
employees we currently have three full time employees

if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business could be materially adversely affected 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
we are dependent on the development of sky ranch  the lowry range and other areas near our rangeview water supply that are potential markets for our export water 
our rangeview water supply is one of our principal sources of future revenue 
the timing and amount of these revenues will depend significantly on the development of the lowry range and sky ranch 
the development of these areas is not within our control 
the lowry range is owned by the land board  which has been considering various development alternatives  including proposals for conservation 
in june  the land board finalized an agreement with lend lease communities llc to develop approximately  acres of the lowry range 
of this  we have the right to provide water service to approximately  acres 
the land board does not have any development proposals for the remaining approximately  acres 
there is currently no development at sky ranch and it is our understanding that the developer of sky ranch is attempting to sell the property 
there can be no assurance that development will occur or that water sales will occur on acceptable terms or in the amounts or time required for us to support our costs of operation 
because of the prior use of the lowry range as a military facility  environmental clean up may be required prior to development  including the removal of unexploded ordnance 
there is often significant delay in adoption of development plans  as the political process involves many constituencies with differing interests 
in the event water sales are not forthcoming or development of the lowry range is delayed  we may incur additional short or long term debt obligations or seek to sell additional equity to generate operating capital 
if the land board determines to limit the use of significant portions of the lowry range for conservation  it may limit our ability to fully develop our rangeview water supply 
our operations are significantly affected by the general economic conditions for real estate development and the pace and location of real estate development activities in the greater denver metropolitan area  most particularly areas which are close to our rangeview water supply 
during and through august   the colorado housing market has continued to see declines in new construction  which could continue for some time 
increases in the number of our water and wastewater connections  our connection fees and our billings and collections will depend on real estate development in this area 
we have no ability to control the pace and location of real estate development activities which affect our business 
we expect to be involved in on going negotiations with the land board to clarify our rights and obligations with respect to our rangeview water supply and such negotiations may not be successful 
our rangeview water supply rights derive principally from the lease between the land board and the district which was entered into in prior to any development of the lowry range or of areas outside the lowry range that utilize our export water 
the terms of the lease did not fully anticipate the specific circumstances of development that have arisen and may not clearly delineate rights and responsibilities for the forms of transactions that may arise in the future as we enter into and negotiate agreements for sale of water and the provision of service to the lowry range 
we anticipate engaging in negotiations with the state land board from time to time to clarify the applicability of contract terms to circumstances that were not anticipated at the time the agreements were entered into 
an unfavorable outcome in such negotiations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we cannot assure you that such negotiations will be successful 

table of contents in order to utilize the arkansas river water acquired in fiscal  we must apply for a change of use with the colorado water court and this may take several years to complete 
the change of use of our arkansas river water requires a ruling by the colorado water courts  which could take several years and be a costly and contentious effort since it is anticipated that many parties will oppose the transfer of the water 
there are several conditions which must be satisfied prior to our receiving a change of use decree for transfer of our arkansas river water 
one condition that we must satisfy is a showing of anti speculation in which we  as the applicant must demonstrate that we have contractual obligations to provide water service to customers prior to the water court ruling on the transfer of a water right 
the water court is also expected to limit the transfer to the consumptive use portion of the water right and to address changing the historic use of the water from agricultural uses to other uses such as municipal and industrial use 
we expect to face opposition to any consumptive use calculations of the historic agricultural uses of this water 
the water court may impose conditions on our transfer of the water rights such as requiring us to mitigate the loss of the farming tax base  imposing re vegetation requirements to convert soils from irrigated to non irrigated  and imposing water quality measures 
any such conditions will likely increase the cost of transferring the water rights 
our valuation of the tap participation fee payable to hp a m contains estimates and management assumptions 
the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
as part of our acquisition of the arkansas river water rights from hp a m  we granted hp a m a tap participation fee entitling hp a m to receive ten percent of the gross proceeds of our sales of forty thousand  water taps 
we have estimated the fair value of the tap participation fee payable to hp a m using available historic market information and estimated future market information 
we believe the estimates we used reasonably reflect the fair value of the tap participation fee 
estimates involve matters of uncertainty and judgment and interpreting relevant market data is inherently subjective in nature 
many factors are necessary to estimate future market conditions  including but not limited to  supply and demand for new homes  population growth along the front range  cash flows  tap fee increases at our rate based districts  and other market forces beyond our control 
the actual results could differ materially from our estimates which would result in significantly higher fees being paid to hp a m than what are reflected in our balance sheet and significantly higher imputed interest being reflected on our future statements of operations associated with the tap participation fee 
in the event of default by hp a m on promissory notes secured by deeds of trust on our properties  we would be required to cure the defaults or lose the properties 
certain of the properties we acquired from hp a m are subject to promissory notes  aggregating million in principal and interest as of august  the notes are secured by deeds of trust on the properties we own  but are the responsibility of hp a m 
because the likelihood of hp a m defaulting on the notes is deemed remote  these promissory notes are not reflected on our balance sheet 
however  if hp a m were to default on the notes  and we did not cure the defaults  we would lose approximately of the real property interests we acquired and the water rights associated with those properties 
our net losses may continue and we may not have sufficient liquidity to pursue our business objectives 
we have experienced significant net losses and could continue to incur net losses 
for the years ended august   and  we had net losses of approximately million   and  respectively  on revenues of approximately   and  in the respective periods 
our cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to fund our operations in the past  and we have been required to raise debt and equity capital to remain in operation 
since  we have raised approximately million through the issuance of common stock to support our operations 
our ability to fund our operational needs and meet our business objectives will depend on our ability to generate cash from future operations 
if our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are not sufficient to fund our operations and the significant capital expenditure requirements to build our water delivery systems  we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities  or seek to obtain additional debt or equity capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 

table of contents the rates we are allowed to charge customers on the lowry range are limited by the lease with the land board and our contract with the district and may not be sufficient to cover our costs of construction and operation 
the prices we can charge for our water and wastewater services on the lowry range are subject to pricing regulations set in the lease with the land board 
both the tap fees and our usage rates and charges are based on the average of the rates of our rate based districts 
annually we survey the tap fees and rates of our rate based districts and set our tap fees and rates and charges based on the average of those charged by this group 
our costs associated with the construction of water delivery systems and the production  treatment and delivery of our water are subject to market conditions and other factors  which may increase at a significantly greater rate than the prices charged by our rate based districts 
factors beyond our control and which cannot be predicted  such as drought  water contamination and severe weather conditions  like tornadoes and floods  may result in additional labor and material costs that may not be recoverable under our operations and maintenance contracts  creating additional differences from the costs of our rate based districts 
increased customer demand may also increase the overall cost of our operations 
if the costs for construction and operation of our water services  including the cost of extracting our groundwater  exceed our revenues  we may petition the land board for rate increases 
there can be no assurance that the land board would approve a rate increase request beyond the average of the rate based districts 
our profitability could be negatively impacted if we experience an imbalance of costs and revenues and are not successful in receiving approval for rate increases 
we only have three employees and may not be able to manage the increasing demands of our expanding operations 
we currently have only three employees to administer our existing assets  interface with applicable governmental bodies  market our services and plan for the construction and development of our future assets 
we may not be able to maximize the value of our water assets because of our limited manpower 
we depend significantly on the services of mark w 
harding  our president 
the loss of mr 
harding would cause a significant interruption of our operations 
the success of our future business development and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities depends on our ability to attract and retain additional experienced and qualified persons to operate and manage our business 
state regulations set the training  experience and qualification standards required for our employees to operate specific water and wastewater facilities 
failure to find state certified and qualified employees to support the operation of our facilities could put us at risk  among other things  for operational errors at the facilities  for improper billing and collection processes  and for loss of contracts and revenues 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully manage our assets and our growth 
we may be adversely affected by any future decision by the colorado public utilities commission to regulate us as a public utility 
the colorado public utilities commission cpuc regulates investor owned water companies operating for the purpose of supplying the public 
the cpuc regulates many aspects of public utilities operations  including the location and construction of facilities  establishing water rates and fees  initiating inspections  enforcement and compliance activities and assisting consumers with complaints 

table of contents we do not believe we are a public utility under colorado law 
we currently provide services by contract to the district  which supplies the public 
quasi municipal metropolitan districts  such as the district  are exempt by statute from regulation by the cpuc 
however  the cpuc could attempt to regulate us as a public utility 
if this were to occur  we might incur significant expense challenging the cpuc s assertion of jurisdiction  and we may be unsuccessful 
in the future  existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities 
if we become regulated as a public utility  our ability to generate profits could be limited and we might incur significant costs associated with regulatory compliance 
there are many obstacles to our ability to sell our paradise water supply 
we currently earn no revenues from our paradise water supply  which as of august  has a recorded cost of approximately million 
our ability to convert our paradise water supply into an income generating asset is limited 
due to the nature of the paradise water rights and agreements with other western slope water interests  our use of the paradise water supply is limited to opportunities along the western slope 
as part of our water court decree for the paradise water supply  we are permitted to construct a storage facility on the colorado river 
however  pursuant to a stipulation entered into with various objectors to our paradise water rights  and the strict regulatory requirements for constructing a reservoir on the main stem of the colorado river  completing the storage facility at its decreed location will be difficult 
we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to make use of this asset or sell the water profitably 
our paradise water supply is also conditioned on a finding of reasonable diligence from the water court every six years 
to arrive at that finding  the water court must determine that we continue to diligently pursue the development of the water rights  either directly or indirectly through a third party who has a contractual commitment for its use 
if the water court is unable to make such a finding  our right to the paradise water supply would be lost and we would be required to impair the paradise water supply asset and incur a million charge against earnings 
the fiscal review was completed in but not without objectors and not without us having to agree to certain stipulations to remove the objections 
conflicts of interest may arise relating to the operation of the district 
our officers  employees and a majority shareholder constitute a majority of the directors of the rangeview metropolitan district 
in addition  pure cycle  along with our officers and employees and one unrelated individual  own  as tenants in common  the acres that form the district 
pursuant to state law  directors receive for each board meeting or a maximum compensation of  per year 
we have made loans to the district to fund its operations 
at august   total principal and interest owed to us by the district was approximately  the district is a party to our agreements with the land board and receives fees of of the revenues from the sale of water on the lowry range 
proceeds from the fee collections will initially be used to repay the district s obligations to us  but after these loans are repaid  the district is not required to use the funds to benefit pure cycle 
we have received benefits from our activities undertaken in conjunction with the district  but conflicts may arise between our interests and those of the district  and with our officers who are acting in dual capacities in negotiating contracts to which both we and the district are parties 
we expect that the district will expand when more properties are developed and become part of the district  and our officers acting as directors of the district will have fiduciary obligations to those other constituents 
there can be no assurance that all conflicts will be resolved in the best interests of pure cycle and its stockholders 
in addition  other landowners coming into the district will be eligible to vote and to serve as directors of the district 
there can be no assurances that our officers and employees will remain as directors of the district or that the actions of a subsequently elected board would not have an adverse impact on our operations 

table of contents we are required to maintain stringent water quality standards and are subject to regulatory and environmental risks 
we must provide water that meets all federal and state regulatory water quality standards and operate our water and wastewater facilities in accordance with these standards 
we face contamination and pollution issues regarding our water supplies 
improved detection technology  increasingly stringent regulatory requirements  and heightened consumer awareness of water quality issues contribute to an environment of increased focus on water quality 
we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to reduce the amounts of contaminants in our water to acceptable levels 
in addition  the standards that we must meet are constantly changing and becoming more stringent 
future changes in regulations governing the supply of drinking water and treatment of wastewater may have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we handle certain hazardous materials at our water treatment facilities  primarily sodium hypochlorite 
any failure of our operation of the facilities in the future  including sewage spills  noncompliance with water quality standards  hazardous materials leaks and spills  and similar events could expose us to environmental liabilities  claims and litigation costs 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully manage these issues  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations by increasing our costs for damages and cleanup 
our contracts for the construction of water and wastewater projects may expose us to certain completion and performance risks 
we intend to rely on independent contractors to construct our water and wastewater facilities 
these construction activities may involve risks  including shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor relations disputes  weather interference  engineering  environmental  permitting or geological problems and unanticipated cost increases 
these issues could give rise to delays  cost overruns or performance deficiencies  or otherwise adversely affect the construction or operation of our water and wastewater delivery systems 
in addition  we may experience quality problems in the construction of our systems and facilities  including equipment failures 
we cannot assure you that we will not face claims from customers or others regarding product quality and installation of equipment placed in service by contractors 
certain of our contracts may be fixed price contracts  in which we may bear all or a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns 
under these fixed price contracts  contract prices are established in part based on fixed  firm subcontractor quotes on contracts and on cost and scheduling estimates 
these estimates may be based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other issues 
if these subcontractor quotations or cost estimates prove inaccurate  or if circumstances change  cost overruns may occur  and our financial results would be negatively impacted 
in many cases  the incurrence of these additional costs would not be within our control 
we may have contracts in which we guarantee project completion by a scheduled date 
at times  we may guarantee that the project  when completed  will achieve certain performance standards 
if we fail to complete the project as scheduled  or if we fail to meet guaranteed performance standards  we may be held responsible for cost impacts and or penalties to the customer resulting from any delay or for the costs to alter the project to achieve the performance standards 
to the extent that these events occur and are not due to circumstances for which the customer accepts responsibility or cannot be mitigated by performance bonds or the provisions of our agreements with contractors  the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and our financial results would be negatively impacted 
our customers may require us to secure performance and completion bonds for certain contracts and projects 
the market environment for surety companies has become more risk averse 
we secure performance and completion bonds for our contracts from these surety companies 
to the extent we are unable to obtain bonds  we may not be awarded new contracts 
we cannot assure you that we can secure performance and completion bonds where required 
we may operate engineering and construction activities for water and wastewater facilities where design  construction or system failures could result in injury to third parties or damage to property 
any losses that exceed claims against our contractors  the performance bonds and our insurance limits at facilities so managed could result in claims against us 
in addition  if there is a customer dispute regarding performance of our services  the customer may decide to delay or withhold payment to us

we operate primarily in the denver metropolitan area and own nearly  acre feet of groundwater and or certain surface water rights in the denver area 
we also own approximately  acre feet of arkansas river water  we have the exclusive rights to use over  acre feet of groundwater located at the lowry range through the year  and we own  acre feet of conditional colorado river water rights on the western slope of colorado 
we plan to utilize our denver assets and our arkansas river water to provide large scale residential commercial water and wastewater services to customers located along the front range of colorado 
we are also exploring ways to use our western slope water for commercial or agricultural purposes along the western slope of colorado 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we have identified certain key accounting policies on which our financial condition and results of operations are dependent 
these key accounting policies most often involve complex matters and are based on subjective judgments or decisions 
in the opinion of management  our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition  impairment of water assets and other long lived assets  depletion and depreciation  accounting for participating interests in export water  tap participation fees  royalty and other obligations  and income taxes 
management periodically reviews its estimates  including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates 
revenue recognition our revenues consist mainly of tap fees  construction fees and monthly service fees 
emerging issues task force issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  governs how to identify when goods or services  or both  that are separately delivered but included in a single sales arrangement should be accounted for individually 
based on the criteria of eitf  we account for each of the items contained in our service agreements individually 
that is  we determine the proper revenue recognition for tap fees  construction fees and services fees independent of one another 
proceeds from tap sales and construction fees are deferred upon receipt and recognized in income based on whether we own or do not own the facilities constructed with the proceeds 
tap fees and construction fees derived from agreements for which we construct infrastructure the customer will own are recognized in accordance with statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  whereby we recognize tap fees and construction fees as revenue and costs of construction based on the percentage of completion method 
tap fees and construction fees derived from agreements for which we will own the infrastructure are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab  whereby the up front fees are recognized ratably over the estimated service life of the facilities constructed  starting at completion of construction 
because we own these facilities  we capitalize construction costs and amortize those as costs of revenue over the assets estimated useful life 

table of contents we recognize water and wastewater usage revenues upon delivery of water and collection of wastewater  in the month in which the services are performed 
water service fees are based upon metered water deliveries to customers plus base charges 
wastewater customers are charged flat monthly fees 
impairment of water assets and other long lived assets in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we review our long lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows we expect to be generated by the eventual use of the asset the fair value 
for our denver based assets and the arkansas river valley assets  we determined the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by estimating tap sales related to new home development in our service area  less costs to provide water services  including estimated engineering costs  over an estimated development period 
actual new home development in our service area  as well as future tap fees and future operating costs  could vary materially from our estimates which would have a material impact on our financial statements 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets estimated as described above 
for our paradise water supply  we determined the undiscounted cash flows by estimating the proceeds we could derive from the leasing of the water rights to commercial and agricultural users along the western slope of colorado 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
every six years the paradise water supply is subject to a finding of reasonable diligence review by the water court and the state engineer to determine if we are diligently pursuing the development of the water rights 
during fiscal  the water court began this review 
in fiscal we received objections from two parties to our paradise water rights 
the objectors expressed concerns that we have not diligently pursued the development of the paradise water rights and they sought additional assurances that we intend to develop this water in the future 
in fiscal  we reached an agreement with the objectors and agreed to various stipulations which are described in note water  water systems and service agreement in the accompanying financial statements 
as a result  we received a finding of reasonable diligence on our latest review 
based on the sfas impairment analysis performed on our long lived water assets  we believe there were no impairments in the carrying amounts of our investments in water and water systems at august  accounting for caa payments the balance sheet liability captioned participating interests in export water supply the participating interests represents an obligation which arose under the water commercialization agreement the wca  as amended by the caa 
upon entering into the caa  we recorded an initial liability of approximately million  which represents the cash we received and used to purchase our export water supply 
in return we agreed to remit a total of million of proceeds received from the sale of export water to the participating interest holders 
in accordance with eitf issue no sales of future revenues  the obligation for the million was recorded as debt  and the remaining million contingent liability is not reflected on our balance sheet because the obligation to pay this is contingent on sales of export water  the amounts and timing of which are not reasonably determinable 

table of contents as of august   the remaining participating interests liability reflected on our balance sheet totaled approximately million  and the contingent liability not reflected on our balance sheet totaled approximately million 
for more information see note participating interests in export water in the accompanying financial statements 
tap participation fee on august   we acquired  acre feet of arkansas river water along with real property and other associated rights from hp a m 
along with common stock issued to hp a m  we agreed to pay hp a m of our tap fees on the sale of the next  water taps  of which  water taps remain to be paid at august  during the due diligence period specified in the arkansas river agreement  hp a m sold certain property rights which pursuant to the terms of the agreement were deemed to be tap participation fee payments 
the value of these payments equated to taps under the tap participation section of the arkansas river agreement 
during our fiscal we sold shares in the lower arkansas water management authority the lawma shares  acquired pursuant to the arkansas river agreement  for approximately  pursuant to the arkansas river agreement  the payments were deemed to be tap participation fee payments  the value of which equated to taps 
the tap participation fee is payable when we sell water taps and receive the funds from such water tap sales 
the tap participation fee payable to hp a m was valued based on a discounted cash flow model using highly subjective assumptions and estimates 
we will assess the value of the liability whenever events or circumstances indicate the assumptions used to estimate the value of the liability have changed materially 
the difference between the net present value and the estimated realizable value will be imputed as interest expense using the effective interest method over the estimated development period utilized in the valuation of the tap participation fee beginning september  obligations payable by hp a m certain of the properties we acquired pursuant to the arkansas river agreement are subject to outstanding promissory notes with principal and accrued interest totaling approximately million at august  these notes are secured by deeds of trust on the properties 
we did not assume any of these promissory notes and are not responsible for making any of the required payments under these notes 
this responsibility remains solely with hp a m 
in the event of default by hp a m  we may make payments on any or all of the notes and cure any or all of the defaults 
if we do not cure the defaults  we will lose the properties securing the defaulted notes 
if hp a m defaults on the promissory notes  we can foreclose on a defined amount of pure cycle stock issued to hp a m being held in escrow and reduce the tap participation fee by two times the amount of notes defaulted on by hp a m 
although the likelihood of hp a m defaulting on the notes is deemed remote  we will continue to monitor the status of the notes for any indications of default 
we are not aware of any defaults by hp a m as of august  royalty and other obligations revenues from the sale of export water are shown net of royalties payable to the land board 
revenues from the sale of water on the lowry range are shown net of the royalties to the land board and the fees retained by the district 
depletion and depreciation of water assets water supplies that are being utilized are depleted on the basis of units produced divided by the total volume of water adjudicated in the water decrees 
water systems are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets until realization is more likely than not 
results of operations executive summary the results of our operations for the years ended august   and were as follows table e summary results of operations millions of gallons of water delivered water revenues generated water delivery operating costs incurred water delivery gross margin wastewater treatment revenues wastewater treatment operating costs incurred wastewater treatment gross margin general and administrative expenses net losses water and wastewater usage revenues water deliveries during fiscal dropped approximately over water deliveries in fiscal this was a result of high precipitation experienced throughout the front range of colorado starting in december and lasting into the spring of increased precipitation results in our customers using less water for irrigation 
water usage fees in fiscal decreased over fiscal  despite the decrease in gallons delivered 
this is a result of increased usage fees on july  water deliveries in fiscal and were consistent  but usage fees in fiscal were much higher than fiscal this is due to increases in usage fees on july  our water service charges are based on a tiered pricing structure that provides for higher prices as customers use greater amounts of water 
our rates and charges are established based on the average of three surrounding communities  referred to as our rate based districts 
table b included above in item description of business  outlines our tiered pricing structure and changes during fiscal  and  respectively 
our wastewater customers are charged flat monthly fees based on the number of tap connections they have 
wastewater usage fees increased july   from to per wastewater tap per month and before that they increased july   from to per wastewater tap per month  which accounts for the changes in revenues between the fiscal years 
gross margins for water and wastewater services declined in fiscal over fiscal and fiscal this is due to declines in the amount of water delivered 
decreased water deliveries does not typically equate to a decrease in the energy usage within the systems  and therefore  in reduced delivery years  gross margins will typically be lower 
the decline is also due to certain testing and compliance expenses incurred during fiscal not experienced in the previous two years presented 
gross margins for water and wastewater operations remained consistent in fiscal and 
table of contents general and administrative and other expenses general and administrative g a expenses for fiscal and were impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  as follows years ended august  increase g a expenses as reported sfas r expenses g a expenses less sfas r expenses we adopted sfas r on the first day of our fiscal  so fiscal was not impacted by sfas r 
the increase in g a expenses for the three fiscal years ended august   is mainly attributable to the following salaries and related expenses including sfas r expenses and healthcare costs totaled approximately million   and  for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
without the effects of sfas r  salary and related expenses in fiscal and would have been  and  respectively  an increase of  this increase is mainly attributable to employee bonuses totaling  in fiscal  paid upon completion of the equity offering in july  which exceeded the  of bonuses paid in fiscal salaries for without the impact of sfas r exceeded fiscal salaries by  which is mainly attributable to pay raises and the fact that bonuses in fiscal totaled  during fiscal  we expensed approximately  related to water assessment charges payable to the flcc 
this represents our share based on the number of flcc shares we own of flcc s annual operating and maintenance expenditures 
these charges were not incurred during fiscal or because we acquired the arkansas water rights in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  we expensed approximately  for work performed in the arkansas river valley on our behalf by hp a m 
professional fees legal and accounting totaled approximately   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
approximately  of the increases from fiscal to fiscal was a result of services performed in connection with our consultations with the staff of the securities and exchange commission completed during fiscal the remaining increase was a result of the internal control audits as a result of the sarbanes oxley act of and related items 
franchise fees to the state of delaware and nasdaq listing fees increased approximately  since fiscal due to the increase in our total assets as a result of the arkansas river water acquisition and the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercising of stock options 
we paid approximately  in consulting fees related to our discussions with lend lease communities llc as it relates to the potential development of six sections of the lowry range 
depreciation and depletion charges for the years ended august   and were approximately   and  respectively 
the year to year increases are mainly a result of depreciation charges associated with the water delivery fixtures acquired from hp a m on august  depreciation began on september  and depreciation of capitalized legal costs associated with the hp a m asset acquisition 
in addition  in late fiscal we began depreciating the costs incurred to extend the water system to the arapahoe county fairgrounds 
we expect the depreciation and depletion charges going forward to remain consistent with the fiscal charges 

table of contents interest income totaled approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
this represents interest earned on the temporary investment of capital in available for sale securities  interest accrued on the note payable by the district and interest accrued on the special facilities construction proceeds receivable from the county 
the decrease for fiscal over is due to fewer funds being invested and earning interest as a result of the arapahoe county construction project in fiscal and cash used in operations 
interest income in fiscal is expected to increase as we have increased our invested capital by approximately million as a result of the equity offering in july imputed interest expense related to the tap participation fee payable to hp a m totaled approximately million for the year ended august  this represents the expensed portion of the difference between the relative fair value of the liability and the net present value of the liability recognized under the effective interest method 
interest expense related parties was approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
all interest bearing debt related parties  was paid off or extinguished as of august  the significant decrease from to was due to repayments of related party debt 
in late fiscal we retired million of related party debt which included accrued interest and in december we retired  of related party debt which included accrued interest 
see note long term debt in the accompanying financial statements 
interest expense non related parties was approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
all interest bearing debt was extinguished as of august  the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to increases in interest rates 
our net losses  as reported in our statements of operations in fiscal  and  were approximately million   and million  respectively 
our reported net losses have been materially impacted by the imputed interest on the tap participation fee and stock based compensation expense recognized pursuant to sfas r 
in the table below  we have presented a non gaap financial disclosure to provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of the imputed interest and stock based compensation expenses on our reported net losses and loss per share 
because these items do not require the use of current assets  management does not include these items in its analysis of our financial results or how we allocate our resources 
because of this  we deemed it meaningful to provide this non gaap disclosure of the impact of these significant items on our financial results 
years ended august  change net loss as reported interest imputed on tap participation fees payable to hp a m sfas r expenses net loss less imputed interest and sfas r expenses net loss per common share as reported interest imputed on tap participation fees payable to hp a m sfas r expenses net loss per common share less non cash interest and sfas r expenses weighted avererage common shares outstanding 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at august   our working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was approximately million  and we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand totaling approximately million 
we believe that at august   we have sufficient working capital to fund our operations for the next year 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing the water from our primary water projects in the near term 
in the event increased revenues and cash flows from providing water and wastewater services are not achieved  we may incur additional short or long term debt or seek to sell additional equity securities to generate working capital to support our operations 
development of the water that we own  have rights to use  or may seek to acquire  will require substantial capital investments 
we anticipate that capital required for the development of the water and wastewater systems will be financed through the sale of water taps to developers and water delivery charges to users 
a water tap charge refers to a charge we impose to fund construction of wholesale facilities and permit access to a water delivery system eg  a single family home s tap into our water system  and a water service charge refers to a water customer s monthly water bill  generally including a base charge and consumption charges per  gallons of water delivered to the customer 
we anticipate tap fees will be sufficient to generate funds with which we can design and construct the necessary wholesale facilities 
however  once we receive tap fees from a developer  we are contractually obligated to construct the wholesale facilities for the taps paid  even if our costs are not covered by the fees we receive 
we cannot assure you that our sources of cash will be sufficient to cover all our capital costs 
on august   we finalized the arkansas river agreement whereby we purchased approximately  acre feet of arkansas river water  real property and certain other related assets 
pursuant to the arkansas river agreement we agreed to pay hp a m of our tap fees received on the sale of the next  water taps 
we have estimated the tap participation fee payable to hp a m at approximately million as of august   which is million as of august   including million of imputed interest based on a discounted cash flow valuation analysis 
the actual amount to be paid could exceed our estimates 
see note water  water systems and service agreements in the accompanying financial statements 
tap participation payments are not payable to hp a m until we receive water tap fees 
we are obligated to pay the flcc water assessment charges which are the charges assessed to the flcc shareholders for the upkeep and maintenance of the fort lyon canal 
the calendar charges totaled approximately  which we expect to remain relatively consistent for calendar on august   we entered into the county agreement to provide water service to the fairgrounds 
pursuant to the county agreement  funding of million for the construction of the special facilities will come from the county and will be provided as follows i an initial payment of  received in august  and ii  paid over ten years  which includes interest at  which based on currently scheduled payments will result in us receiving  in interest 
upon the delivery of a water rights warranty deed by the county to us for approximately acre feet of groundwater  the amount payable over ten years will be reduced by approximately  which is the value of groundwater 
since we have not received this water rights deed  the value of the water to be conveyed to us is currently included in the construction proceeds receivable account on our balance sheet 
see note water  water systems and service agreements in the accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding the county agreement and a proposed amendment 
in accordance with sab  upon completion of construction of the fairgrounds facilities and the initiation of water service to the fairgrounds in july  we began ratably recognizing tap fee revenue as income 
the tap fees received from the county are being recognized in income over the estimate useful life of the constructed assets  or years 
for the year ended august   we recognized water tap fee revenues of approximately  
table of contents on october   and then on may   we entered into the sky ranch agreements with the developer of sky ranch 
pursuant to the sky ranch agreements we are required to provide water for all homes and buildings to be constructed at sky ranch  which could go as high as  sfe units 
pursuant to the sky ranch agreements  the developer must purchase at least water taps before occupancy of the first home 
the sky ranch agreements permit the developer to add additional taps annually  with at least taps to be purchased each year after construction begins 
this schedule is designed to provide us with adequate funds with which to construct the wholesale facilities needed to provide water service to the areas being developed 
we do not currently have any information regarding when or if sky ranch will begin development 
see also item business sky ranch water supply and water service agreements above for information regarding the developer of sky ranch being in default on the sky ranch agreements 
to the extent that water service is provided using export water  we are required to pay a royalty to the land board equal to of the net revenue after deducting direct and indirect costs  including a reasonable charge for overhead  associated with the withdrawal  treatment and delivery of export water 
the developer of sky ranch is currently in default on the option agreements 
if the developer cures the defaults  we expect to dedicate approximately  acre feet  or approximately  of our export water supply which is about of our overall rangeview water supply for the sky ranch project 
we estimate we will spend approximately million for infrastructure costs related to the development and delivery of water to the sky ranch development 
at august   we had outstanding debt to one related party totaling approximately  all other interest bearing notes with scheduled maturities were repaid or extinguished during fiscal as described in the accompanying financial statements 
the remaining note payable was paid in full in october operating activities operating activities include revenues we receive from the sale of water and wastewater services to our customers  costs incurred in the delivery of those services  general and administrative expenses  and depletion depreciation expenses 
cash used by operating activities was approximately million   and  for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
cash used by operations in included the following significant cash payments approximately  in wages and related employee expenses  which is  higher than due mainly to additional bonuses to management and employees following the equity offering  approximately  of flcc water assessment charges since september  this includes our fiscal assessments and a portion of the calendar assessments  approximately  of professional fees  which is significantly higher than fiscal  mainly due to approximately  for professional fees related to consultations with the staff of the commission of the sec  approximately  for delaware franchise fees and nasdaq listing fees  which is approximately  higher than the cash paid in mainly due to the increased assets and number of shares outstanding as a result of the arkansas river water acquisition the  paid in fiscal includes amounts expensed in fiscal and  approximately  for directors fees and expenses  which includes approximately  for insurance 
cash used by operations decreased from fiscal to due to lower salaries following the passing away of our former ceo and decreased health insurance costs for the same reason and because we switched to a new insurance provider  offset by an increase in management bonuses and increased board of director fees  annual retainers  and insurance 

table of contents during fiscal  and  we accrued interest on the note receivable from the district of approximately   and  respectively 
the increase is caused by increases in interest rates 
these amounts were offset by decreases in accrued interest on notes payable of approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in interest expense are due to the extinguishment of all interest bearing debt as of august  with the extinguishment of  of principal and accrued interest in august  the repayment of  of notes payable to a related party in december and the repayment of million of debt along with approximately million of accrued interest in fiscal we will continue to provide domestic water and wastewater service to customers in our service area and we will continue to operate and maintain our water and wastewater systems with our own employees 
investing activities we continue to invest in the acquisition  development and maintenance of our water systems 
on august  we acquired the arkansas river water  represented by the shares in the flcc and certain other real and personal property  in exchange for equity and a tap participation fee payable when we sell water taps 
in total  we expended  related to legal and engineering costs associated with this acquisition  which have been capitalized as part of the costs of the acquired assets 
during fiscal  we invested approximately million in the construction of the facilities required to provide water service to the fairgrounds which were completed in july  with minimal construction related expenditures continuing into fiscal  which were accrued at august  we intend to exercise our rights to acquire the final of the sky ranch groundwater pursuant to the agreement for the purchase of denver aquifer groundwater for  in fiscal in fiscal fiscal and we paid  for the purchase of of the groundwater  but the purchases have not been capitalized as part of our water assets because the developer has not cashed the checks and we have not received the water rights deeds 
because we have been unable to obtain any response from the developer  we do not know when we will obtain these deeds 
we also continue to invest in legal and engineering fees associated with certain water rights  and we continue to invest in the right of way permit fees to the department of interior bureau of land management and legal and engineering costs for our paradise water supply 
cash provided by used in investing activities for fiscal  and was approximately million  million and  respectively 
the most significant investing activities that generated cash flows were the sale or maturity of approximately million of investments  the sale of  of lawma shares and the sale of certain non irrigated land in the arkansas valley 
these were offset by approximately  of temporary investments in marketable securities   of expenditures for fixed assets  and  of cash invested in well enhancement and recovery systems  llc see note investment in well enhancement and recovery systems  llc  to the accompanying financial statements 
the most significant investments in fiscal related to the construction of the fairgrounds water system and costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the arkansas river water 
during fiscal  we maintained temporary investments of funds generated from the equity offering in fiscal and capitalized approximately  of costs related to our water assets  which included approximately  related to the start of construction of the fairgrounds water system 
during fiscal  we received option payments totaling  from the developer of sky ranch related to the potential use of export water which were not received in fiscal or 
as of august   sky ranch option payments totaling  are past due 
we have been unable to collect these amounts from sky ranch and we have no assurances as to when these amounts will be paid 

table of contents financing activities cash provided by financing during fiscal  and was approximately million   and million  respectively 
in july  we finalized our equity offering of million shares of common stock and raised approximately million 
concurrent with the equity offering  we acquired approximately million of caa interests for cash payments totaling approximately million

table of contents a our only operating lease is related to our office space 
the lease is month to month and is cancelable upon thirty days notice 
due to this not being a long term lease  payments cannot be reasonably estimated beyond one year 
b the participating interests liability is payable to the caa holders upon the sale of export water  and therefore  the timing of the payments is uncertain and not reflected in the above table by period 
c the tap participation fee payable to hp a m is payable upon the sale of water taps 
because the timing of these water tap sales is not fixed and determinable  the estimated payments are not reflected in the above table by period 
the amount listed above includes an unamortized discount of approximately million 
the valuation of the tap participation fee payable to hp a m is a significant estimate based on available historic market information and estimated future market information 
many factors are necessary to estimate future market conditions  including but not limited to  supply and demand for new homes  population growth along the front range  cash flows  tap fee increases at our rate based districts  and other market forces beyond our control

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
pure cycle is exposed to market risks that may impact the balance sheets  statements of operations  and statements of cash flows due primarily to changing interest rates and changes in tap fees and usage rates at our rate based districts 
additionally  due to the promissory notes on the land we acquired which we may elect to pay in the event of default by hp a m  we are subject to market risks impacting the ability of hp a m to make the required payments 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding these market risks 
interest rates 
the primary objective for our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of united states treasury obligations and other investment grade debt securities 
as of august   the fair value of our marketable securities was approximately  with maturity dates through january a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not result in a material decrease or increase in the fair value of our marketable securities 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
rates and charges 
our rates and charges are based on the average of our rate based districts and could vary dramatically from year to year 
the rates charged by our rate based districts might not provide us sufficient funds to support our operations and capital required to fund construction activities 
based on the increases in taps fees and usage charges at our rate based districts over the last several years as noted in table a above  we expect rates and charges to continue to be sufficient to meet our operational and construction needs
