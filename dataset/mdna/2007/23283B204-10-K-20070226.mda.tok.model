prospects for the future cytomedix s success is directly dependent on the success of autologel  and the company believes that autologel has a reasonable chance for success in the marketplace 
first and foremost  the company believes that  based on the results of the company s clinical trial and other historical data as well as the preliminary results of a pharmaco economic study  autologel has higher healing rates for diabetic foot ulcers and is more cost effective than most other wound treatments 
the company owns the patents on the process for utilizing platelet gel for wound healing  the basis of its license agreements  through and for the specific formulation of autologel  which provides several competitive advantages  through however  cytomedix is currently facing a regulatory hurdle 
specifically  it is seeking a reversal  or acceptable amendment  to the fda s nse determination letter 
if the company is successful in this effort  then its current strategic plan remains completely in tact 
if efforts are unsuccessful  the company would likely implement one or more contingent strategies 
these contingent strategies are currently being evaluated and refined 
although it is premature to narrow these strategies  they are currently being considered independently and in combinations 
each strategy offers its own unique set of opportunities and challenges 
significant challenges still exist in implementing the company s plans  whether fda clearance is obtained and the company pursues its current strategy  or the company pursues an alternative strategic plan 
management continues to focus its efforts on leveraging the strength of its intellectual property and successes to date

in accordance with the company s investment policy  cash is to be invested in bank and institutional money market funds  or in t bills or short term t notes 
at december   the company s cash balance of approximately million was maintained primarily in bank and institutional money market accounts 
these accounts are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
based on the company s cash balances at december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximately  impact on the company s annual interest income and net loss 
actual changes in rates may differ from the hypothetical assumption used in computing this exposure
