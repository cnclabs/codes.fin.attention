item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of washington 
we are primarily engaged in the business of planning  directing and coordinating the business activities of our wholly owned subsidiary  banner bank 
banner bank is a washington chartered commercial bank that conducts business from its main office in walla walla  washington and its branch offices and loan production offices located in counties in washington  oregon and idaho 
we are subject to regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  and banner bank is subject to regulation by the state of washington department of financial institutions  division of banks and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
as of december  we had total consolidated assets of billion  total deposits of billion and total stockholders equity of million 
over the past three years  we have invested significantly in expanding our branch and distributions systems with a primary emphasis on expanding our presence in the four largest areas of commerce in the northwest the puget sound region of washington  and the greater boise  idaho  portland  oregon  and spokane  washington markets 
from march through december  we have opened new branch offices  relocated five additional branch offices and significantly refurbished our main office in walla walla 
this expansion has continued with the opening of four new branches so far in  one in boise  idaho and one each in portland  la grande and baker city  oregon 
this branch expansion is a significant element in our strategy to grow loans  deposits and customer relationships 
this emphasis on growth has resulted in an elevated level of operating expenses  however  management believes that over time these new branches should help improve profitability by providing lower cost core depos its which will allow us to proportionately reduce higher cost borrowings as a source of funds 
we are committed to continuing this branch expansion strategy for the next two to three years and have plans and projects in process for six additional new offices expected to open in the next months and are exploring other opportunities 
in addition to organic branch expansion  we recently signed definitive merger agreements for the acquisition of f m bank  a branch commercial bank in the spokane  washington market and with san juan financial holding company  the parent company of islanders bank  a three branch commercial bank in the north puget sound region 
both acquisitions increase our presence within desirable marketplaces and allow us to better serve existing and future customers 
our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  consisting of loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  composed primarily of customer deposits  fhlb advances  other borrowings and junior subordinated debentures 
net interest income is primarily a function of our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as more fully explained below  our net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of strong growth in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the mix of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  including the effects of certain balance sheet restructuring transactions completed in the quarter ended december  our net income also is affected by provisions for loan losses and the level of our other income  including deposit service charges  loan origination and servicing fees  and gains and losses on the sale of loans and securities  as well as our operating expenses and income tax provisions 
in our net income was increased by a million net after tax insurance recovery which significantly reduced other operating expenses  as explained below 
in  our net income was also materially affected by certain balance sheet restructuring transactions which were executed late in the fourth quarter and designed to reposition portions of our balance sheet in order to improve our net interest income  net interest margin and net income in future periods 
the total cost of the restructuring transactions resulted in an million net after tax charge to net income 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to the prior year 
the provision in the current year reflects significantly lower net charge offs balanced against modestly higher levels of non performing loans  growth in the size of the loan portfolio and continuing changes in the loan mix 
other operating income increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
much of the increase is a result of the million loss on the sale of securities in relation to the balance sheet restructuring transaction in december of the remaining increase is primarily a result of increased deposit fees and other service charges 
other operating expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for however  this decrease reflects the effects of both the million net proceeds from the insurance recovery in and the million of prepayment penalties associated with the balance sheet restructuring in excluding the insurance recovery and the prepayment penalties  recurring other operating expenses would have increased to million from million in  a increase that is largely reflective of our continued growth 
net income increased by million to million for the year ended december   however  earnings from recurring operations see following paragraph  exclusive of the insurance recovery and balance sheet restructuring transactions noted above  increased by million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in earnings from recurring operations reflects growth in our operations  including customer deposits and earning assets  an improving mix of assets and liabilities and lower credit costs when compared to prior periods 
earnings from recurring operations and other earnings information excluding the restructuring charges represent non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measures 
management has presented these non gaap financial measures in this discussion and analysis because it believes that they provide more useful and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations reflected in the current year results 
where applicable  we have also presented comparable earnings information using gaap financial measures 
management s discussion and analysis of results of operations is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
critical accounting policies in the opinion of management  the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition and related interim consolidated statements of income  comprehensive income  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows reflect all adjustments which include reclassification and normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  management has identified several accounting policies that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the recognition of interest income  determination of the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses and the valuation of goodwill  mortgage servicing rights and real estate held for sale 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time 
however  because of the sensitivity of the financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the r esults of operations or financial condition 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time 
however  because of the sensitivity of the financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition 
adoption and pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
generally  the approach to accounting for share based payments in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values ie  pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  using a modified version of prospective application modified prospective application 
under modified prospective application  as it is applicable to us  sfas no 
r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after january  additi onally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered generally referring to non vested awards that are outstanding as of january  must be recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered over periods after the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the attribution of compensation cost for those earlier awards will be based on the same method and on the same grant date fair values previously determined for the pro forma disclosures required for companies that did not adopt the fair value accounting method for stock based employee compensation 
additional stock based compensation expense  related to options  included in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  was approximately   net of tax  or per diluted share 
for additional information  see notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract 
the statement permits a company to choose either the amortized cost method or fair value measurement method for each class of separately recognized servicing assets 
this statement is effective for us on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin establishes a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition requirements 
fin is effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on our financial condition and results of operations  however  it is not expected to have a material effect 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies whenever assets or liabilities are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under currently existing standards 
no additional fair value measurements are required under this statement 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we plan to apply the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to all fair value measurements 
comparison of financial condition at december  and general total assets increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  the increase largely resulted from growth in our loan portfolio and was funded primarily by deposit growth 
net loans receivable gross loans less loans in process  deferred fees and discounts  and allowance for loan losses increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  reflecting continued strong demand for and sales of new homes in many of our markets  by far the most significant growth occurred in construction and land loans 
loans to finance the construction of one to four family residential real estate increased by million  or  and land and development loans increased by million  or  since december  in addition  loans for the construction of commercial real estate increased by million  or 
loan growth also included increases in loans to finan ce existing commercial real estate  which increased by million  or  in consumer loans  which increased by million  or  in commercial loans  which increased by million  or  and in agricultural loans  which increased by million  or 
loans to finance existing one to four family residential properties decreased by million  or  compared to december   as we completed the sale of approximately million of loans previously included in the loans held for portfolio portion of our balance sheet 
this sale  which was in addition to our normal mortgage banking activity  was designed to modestly improve our liquidity position and adjust our interest rate risk profile 
additional details of this sale are included below in the other operating income section of this discussion 
securities available for sale and held to maturity decreased million  or  from million at december   to million at december   primarily as a result of scheduled principal reductions and prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
property and equipment increased by million to million at december   from million at december  the increase included additional site  construction and equipment costs associated with new facilities recently opened or in progress as part of our continuing branch expansion strategy 
deposits grew million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  non interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million  while interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to billion from the prior year 
it is our belief that the modest increase in non interest bearing deposit balances  despite a significant increase in the number of accounts  in part reflects changes in customer behavior in response to the increasing interest rate environment during this period 
in particular  as interest rates on new certificates of deposits have increased  certain customers have moved balances from both non interest bearing and interest bearing transaction and savings accounts into higher yielding certificate accounts 
in addition  certain customers are more effectively utilizing our sweep account products to increase investments retail repurchase agreements or to pay down loan balances 
nonetheless  the aggrega te total of transaction and savings accounts  including money market accounts  increased by million to billion  reflecting our focused efforts to grow these important core deposits 
increasing core deposits is a key element of our expansion strategy including the recent and planned addition and renovation of branch locations  as explained in more detail below 
fhlb advances decreased million from million at december   to million at december   while other borrowings increased million to million at december  the increase in other borrowings reflects an increase of million in retail repurchase agreements that are primarily related to customer cash management accounts  as well as an increase of million of repurchase agreement borrowings from securities dealers  which were partially offset by repayment of a million short term federal funds purchased position that had been established on december  investments at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed and mortgage related securities  municipal bonds  corporate debt obligations  and freddie mac stock 
from time to time  our investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in our loan origination  deposit and other activities 
during the year ended december   investment securities decreased by million as we redeployed cash flow from securities to fund loan growth and pay down borrowings 
holdings of mortgage backed securities decreased million and us treasury and agency obligations increased million 
ownership of corporate and other securities decreased million  while municipal bonds decreased million 
mortgage backed obligations at december   our mortgage backed and mortgage related securities totaled million  or of the consolidated investment portfolio 
included within this amount were collateralized mortgage obligations cmos with a net carrying value of million 
the estimated fair value of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities at december  was million  which is million less than the amortized cost of million 
at december   our portfolio of mortgage backed and mortgage related securities had a weighted average coupon rate of 
at that date  of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities pay interest at a fixed rate and pay at an adjustable interest rate 
the estimated weighted average remaining life of the portfolio was years 
municipal bonds our tax exempt municipal bond portfolio at december  totaled million at estimated fair value million at amortized cost  and was comprised of general obligation bonds ie  backed by the general credit of the issuer and revenue bonds ie  backed by revenues from the specific project being financed issued by cities and counties and various housing authorities  and hospital  school  water and sanitation districts located in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  our primary service area 
we also had taxable bonds in our municipal bond portfolio  which at december  totaled million at estimated fair value million at amortized cost 
at december   general obligation bonds and revenue bonds had total estimated fair values of million and million  respectively 
many of our qualifying municipal bonds are not rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency due to the smaller size of the total issuance and a porti on of these bonds have been acquired through direct private placement by the issuers 
at december   our municipal bond portfolio had a weighted average maturity of approximately years  an average coupon rate of and an average taxable equivalent yield of 
the largest principal balance of any security in the municipal portfolio was a general obligation bond issued by the public hospital district no 
 columbia and walla walla counties  washington  with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million 
corporate bonds our corporate bond portfolio  which totaled million at fair value million at amortized cost at december   was comprised principally of intermediate term fixed rate securities issued by a finance company and long term fixed and adjustable rate capital securities issued by financial institutions 
at december   the portfolio had a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
us government and agency obligations our portfolio of us government and agency obligations had a fair value of million million at amortized cost at december   a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
most of the us government and agency obligations we own include call features which allow the issuing agency the right to call the securities at various dates prior to the final maturity

loans lending our net loan portfolio increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to an increase of million  or  during the year ended december  and an increase of million in the year ended december  while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
during the past three years  the low level of market interest rates and increasing real estate values led to very strong demand for new real estate loans  including construction loans  however  the low rates also resulted in relatively high levels of prepayments on existing loans 
for the years ended december   and  we originated  net of repayments  million  million and million of loans  respectively 
in recent years  we generally have sold most of its newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans to secondary market purchasers 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we sell loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
see loan servicing portfolio below 
the decision to hold or sell loans is based on asset liability management goals and policies and market conditions 
loans held for sale increased slightly to million at december   compared to million at december  at various times  we also purchase whole loans and participation interests in loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and million  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
one to four family residential real estate lending at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we are active originators of one to four family residential loans in communities where they have established offices in washington  oregon and idaho 
despite the adverse effect of rising home prices  continued in migration and strong employment gains in the northwest and the still relatively low mortgage interest rate environment in kept demand for residential loans stable  permitting us to originate a combined total of million of one to four family residential loans for the year 
however  the loan sales noted above  coupled with principal repayments  more than offset this significant origination activity for the year  leading to a slight million decrease in the balance of loans on one to four family residences compared to the prior year 
construction and land lending a significant proportion of our loan portfolio consists of residential construction loans to professional home builders and  to a lesser extent  land loans and construction loans for commercial and multifamily real estate 
in  strong housing markets and low mortgage rates provided continued favorable conditions for construction and development lending 
in response to these favorable market conditions  we significantly increased originations and balances of construction and land loans during the year 
at december   construction and land loans totaled billion including million of land or land development loans and million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans  or of total loans  compared to million  or  at december  construction and land development loan originations totaled billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended de cember  commercial and multifamily real estate lending we also originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no significant concentrations by property type  borrowers or locations 
we experienced reasonable demand for both multifamily and commercial real estate loans in  however  growth in these loan types was somewhat limited as certain competitors were willing to offer longer term fixed rate loans at interest rate levels that were lower than our investment objectives 
combined growth for these loan types was million for the year and  at december   our loan portfolio included million in multifamily and million in commercial real estate loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans comprise d of total loans at december   compared to a year earlier 
commercial lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending 
while strengthening our commitment to small business lending  in recent years we have added experienced officers and staff focused on middle market corporate lending opportunities for borrowers with credit needs generally in a million to million range 
we have leveraged the past success of these officers with responsive local decision making authority to continue to expand this market niche 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped increase the deposit base 
expanding commercial lending and related commercial banking services has been an area of significant focus and staffing has been increased in the areas of credit administration  business development  and loan and deposit operations 
reflecting this effort  for the year ended december   commercial loans increased by 
at december   commercial loans totaled million  or of total loans  co mpared to million  or  at december  loan terms  including the fixed or adjustable interest rate  the loan maturity and the collateral considerations  vary significantly and are negotiated on an individual loan basis 
agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many washington  oregon and idaho locations in our service area 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of its portfolio  we intend to continue to make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operation of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile at times 
at december   agricultural loans totaled million  or of the loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile loans and loans secured by deposit accounts and  although the balances are not currently significant  we have recently reintroduced credit card lending to our consumer loan products 
while consumer lending has traditionally been a small part of our business with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base  it has received renewed emphasis in and this increased effort allowed non real estate related consumer loans to increase modestly despite continuing high levels of prepayments in the current low interest rate environment 
at december   we had million  or of our loans receivable  in outstanding non real estate secured consumer loans  compared to million  or  at december  more importantly  consumer loans secured by one to four family real estate  including home equity lines of credit  increased by million to million  or of total loans  at december   compared to million  or  at december  while consumer loans remain a relatively small portion of the loan portfolio  aggregate growth was in and we anticipate increased consumer loan activity in future periods as our branch network and retail customer base continue to grow 
loan servicing portfolio at december   we were servicing million of loans for others  compared to million at december  during the year ended december   we executed a larger portion of our loan sales on a servicing retained basis  leading to this significant growth in the servicing portfolio  as well as the increase in mortgage servicing right noted below 
the loan servicing portfolio at december  included million of freddie mac mortgage loans  million of fannie mae mortgage loans and million of loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington and oregon 
for the year ended december   million of loan servicing fees  net of  of servicing rights amortization  was recognized in operations 
for the prior year  net loan servicing fees were million 
the decreased servicing income for the current year primarily r eflects a significant decrease in early prepayment fee income on certain commercial real estate loans 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the cost of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized million   and  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and  was   and  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
msrs generally are adversely affected by current and anticipated prepayments resulting from decreasing interest rates

the average life of loans typically is substantially less than their contractual maturities because of principal repayments and prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on certain mortgage loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decreases when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates

deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
at december   we had billion of deposits  including billion of transaction and savings accounts and billion in time deposits  of which billion had remaining maturities of one year or less 
total deposits increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as illustrated in the following table  certificates of deposit have accounted for a larger percentage of the deposit portfolio than have transaction accounts and in certificates of deposit increased 
by contrast  non interest bearing transaction accounts only increased by  or million  over the same time period 
however  also as reflected in the table  we added significantly to total transaction accounts demand  now  savings and money market accounts since total transaction accounts increased by million or for the year ended december  in addition  we offer a money market certificate of deposit which has limited withdrawal features but functions much like a savings account and competes effectively with our competitors money market accounts 
at december   we had million in three month maturity money market certificates of deposit  compared to million at december  further  although not included in deposit balances  in we had an increase of million in retail repurchase agreements  which are customer funds that are primarily associated with sweep account arrangements tied to transaction accounts 
whi le increased use of these cash management services has the effect of reducing transaction account balances  it contributes to increased deposit fee revenues 
deposit balances at december  also included million of public funds owned by various counties  municipalities and other public entities public funds in washington  oregon and idaho  compared to million at december  growing deposits in general and transaction accounts in particular is a core element of our business plan and is a primary focus of our recent and ongoing branch expansion  relocation and renovation activities as well as the increased advertising and marketing campaigns

to access funds  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb seattle and may apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and securities provided certain credit worthiness standards have been met 
at december   we had million of borrowings from the fhlb seattle at a weighted average rate of  a decrease of million compared to a year earlier

in each case  the repurchase agreements are generally due within days 
at december   retail repurchase agreements totaling million  with a weighted average rate of  were secured by a pledge of certain mortgage backed securities and agency securities with a market value of million 
retail repurchase agreement balances increased by million during  largely as a result of increased use of our cash management services by commercial deposit customers 
our outstanding borrowings under wholesale repurchase agreements at december  totaled million at a weighted average rate of  with a weighted average maturity of seven days  and were collateralized by mortgage backed securities with a fair value of million 
additional short term funds are also available through million of commercial bank credit lines 
at december   we had no balances advanced on these credit lines 
we have issued an aggregate of million of trust preferred securities tps since  including million issued in the junior subordinated debentures associated with the tps have been recorded as liabilities on our statement of financial condition  although portions of the tps qualify as tier or tier ii capital for regulatory capital purposes 
see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to the tps 
at december   the tps had a weighted average rate of 
asset quality during the year ended december   we experienced significant deterioration in asset quality  which had a material adverse effect on operating results  primarily through increased loan loss provisioning and increased loan collection costs 
collection costs remained high in the ensuing three years  however  during the years ended december   and  we achieved meaningful improvement in asset quality  resulting in a significant decrease in loan loss provisioning 
table highlights the earlier deterioration and subsequent improvement in our asset quality during the five year period 
while asset quality has been very good for the past two years  for the year ended december   we experienced a modest increase in non performing assets  although net charge offs declined significantly 
non performing assets increased to million  or of total assets  at december   compared to million  or of total assets  at december   and million  or of total assets at december  problem loans in earlier years were primarily due from borrowers located in the puget sound region and were the result of poor risk assessment at the time they were originated  coupled with weakened economic conditions in that area at that time 
generally  non performing loans and assets reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower rather than weakness in the overall economy of the pacific northwest  housing or real estate markets  or depressed farm commodity prices or adverse growing conditions 
in fact  in recent years economic conditions in the markets we serve have been quite good  contributing to the low level of net charge offs and credit costs experienced in at december   our largest non performing loan exposure was for commercial loans totaling million to a non farm operating business  which are primarily secured by ranch land in western idaho and processing equipment 
the second largest non performing loan exposure was for loans to a cold st orage business totaling million primarily secured by commercial real estate in northwestern washington 
the third largest non performing loan exposure was for loans totaling million to an agricultural related business operating in northeastern oregon which are primarily secured by non farm real estate and processing equipment 
real estate owned and other repossessed assets increased by  from  in the prior year to  at december   representing the book value of a parcel of undeveloped land awarded to us in the third quarter of we were awarded the undeveloped land as a result of litigation relative to certain previously charged off loans 
while this award resulted in an increase in real estate owned  since those loans had been fully charged off in prior periods  it also was recognized as a recovery in the third quarter of we are optimistic about the prospects for a near term disposal of this property 
although experiencing an increase in the most recent quart er  we have made very meaningful progress in the past three years in reducing non performing loans and improving our asset quality  which has contributed significantly to our improved operating performance 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our non performing assets and restructured loans within the meaning of sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructuring  at the dates indicated dollars in thousands table non performing assets at december nonaccrual loans loans secured by real estate one to four family commercial multifamily construction land commercial business agricultural business consumer total loans outstanding loans more than days delinquent  still on accrual loans secured by real estate one to four family commercial multifamily construction land commercial business agricultural business consumer total loans outstanding total non performing loans real estate repossessed assets held for sale total non performing assets restructured loans total non performing loans to net loans before allowance for loan losses total non performing loans to total assets total non performing assets to total assets for the year ended december   million in interest income would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans been current  and no interest income on these loans was included in net income for this period 
real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate held for sale until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lower of its cost the unpaid principal balance of the related loan plus foreclosure costs or net realizable value 
subsequent to foreclosure  the property is carried at the lower of the foreclosed amount or net realizable value 
upon receipt of a new appraisal and market analysis  the carrying value is written down through the establishment of a specific reserve to the anticipated sales price  less selling and holding costs 
at december   we had  of real estate owned  which consisted of one parcel of undeveloped land in western washington 
these loans are performing under their restructured terms but are classified substandard 
in addition to the non performing loans noted in table  as of december   we had loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million with respect to which known information concerning possible credit problems with the borrowers or the cash flows of the properties securing the respective loans has caused management to be concerned about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms 
this may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the nonaccrual loan category 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  for the prior year 
our improved operating results reflect significant growth of assets and liabilities  as well as changes in the mix of those assets and liabilities  including the effects of certain balance sheet restructuring transactions completed in the quarter ended december   which have resulted in a significant expansion in our net interest margin as more fully explained below 
the current year earnings were also positively affected by the collection of a million insurance settlement relating to a loss incurred in the net amount of the settlement  following costs  resulted in a million credit to other operating expense and contributed approximately million  or 
per share  to net income for the year ended december  our operating results also reflect substan tial increases in other operating expenses  particularly compensation  occupancy  information services  advertising and miscellaneous expenses  reflecting the growth in locations  operations and staff as we continue to expand 
twelve new or relocated branches contributed to the higher level of operating expenses in the current year compared to the prior year 
during  we opened two new branches in boise  idaho  and during we opened an additional boise branch  as well as new or relocated branches in twin falls  idaho  beaverton  oregon and mercer island  alderwood  east wenatchee  lynden  vancouver  pasco and walla walla  washington 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  largely as a result of the growth in average interest earning assets noted above and the net interest margin expansion as discussed in the remainder of this paragraph 
the net interest margin of in the current year improved basis points from the prior year  reflecting the balance sheet restructuring and our success in attracting higher yielding loans and growing deposits 
while this improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects changes in both the asset and liability mix  including those resulting from the balance sheet restructuring  the lagging effect of increasing market interest rates on deposit costs  as more fully explained below  also contributed to the improvement 
in particular  the average asset mix for the year ended december  reflected proportionately more lo ans  including more higher yielding commercial  construction and land development loans  and fewer investment securities than a year earlier 
at the same time  the average funding liability base had proportionately more deposits  and proportionately fewer borrowings than in the prior year 
reflecting higher market interest rates as well as these mix changes  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  increased by basis points  compared to a year ago  while funding costs for the year increased by basis points over the same period 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest income that occurred was a result of the basis point increase in the average yield on interest earning assets as well as significant growth in these assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets increased to for the year ended december   compared to a year earlier 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to billion  compared to billion in the prior year 
interest income on loans for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the prior year  reflecting the impact of the increase in average loan balances combined with a basis point increase in the average yield on loans 
the increase in average loan yield reflects the i ncreases in the level of market interest rates during the past year  particularly in short term interest rates including the prime rate and libor indices which affect the yield on large portions of our construction  land development  commercial and agricultural loans 
however  following the federal reserve s decision to stop increasing short term interest rates in june  the average yield on these types of loans generally stabilized in the second half of the year 
the increase in average loan yields also reflects changes in the mix of the loan portfolio 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
while the recent level of market interest rates was significantly higher than a year earlier  loan yields did not change to the same degree as previously originated fixed rate loans do not adjust upward to market rates 
in addition  competitive pricing pressure resulted in lower yields on new loan originations 
these factors were somewhat offse t by changes in the loan mix  as growth has been most significant in some of the higher yielding adjustable rate loan categories  particularly construction and land development loans 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock decreased by million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting the fourth quarter balance sheet restructuring transactions  and the interest and dividend income from those investments decreased by million compared to the prior year 
the average yield on our investment securities increased to for the year ended december   from for the prior year  largely reflecting the sale of lower yielding securities and the effect of higher market rates on certain adjustable rate securities and interest bearing deposits 
while insignificant in amount  we received  in dividend income on our fhlb of seattle stock in the fourth quarter of  as the fhlb of seattle received approval to resume paying its members cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
the fhlb of seattle restricted payment of dividends in the fourth quarter of in a move to improve its capital position 
management is hopeful that the fhlb of seattle dividend rate will increase modestly in future periods 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense was the result of the growth in interest bearing liabilities combined with a basis point increase in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from in the prior year  reflecting the higher levels of market interest rates and the maturity of certain lower costing certificates of deposit and fixed rate borrowings 
deposit interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of the significant deposit growth during the past twelve months as well as an increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits 
reflecting our branch expansion and other growth initiatives  average deposit balances inc reased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the prior year  while the average rate paid on deposit balances increased basis points to 
although deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits help mitigate the effect of higher market rates on our cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing has been evident in the relatively modest increase in deposit costs as the federal reserve has increased short term interest rates by basis points from june to june  including an increase of basis points since december  nonetheless  competitive pricing pressure for interest bearing deposits has become quite intense in recent months  as many financial institutions have e xperienced strong loan growth and related funding needs 
in addition  customers have become more effective in managing their non interest bearing transaction account balances as demonstrated by our recent deposit growth being concentrated in certificates of deposit 
as a result  management expects that the cost of deposits will continue to increase in the near term regardless of any changes in market interest rates 
average fhlb advances decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the prior year  reflecting the fourth quarter restructuring transactions and resulting in a million decrease in the related interest expense 
the average rate paid on fhlb advances increased to  just basis points higher than the prior year  as the effect of significantly higher market interest rates on the floating rate and short term portions of the advances was partially offset by the prepayment of million of higher fixed rate  fixed term advances in connection with the balance sheet restructuring transactions completed in the quarter ended december  junior subordinated debentures which were issued in connection with trust preferred securities had an average balance of million and an average cost of including amortization of prepaid underwriting costs for the year ended december  junior subordinated debentures outstand ing in the prior year had an average balance of million with a lower average rate of 
the junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three to six months 
the increased cost of the junior subordinated debentures reflects recent increases in short term market interest rates 
other borrowings consist of retail repurchase agreements with customers and reverse repurchase agreements with investment banking firms secured by certain investment securities 
the average balance for other borrowings increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the prior year  while the related interest expense increased million  to million from million for reflecting growth in our customer cash management services  the average balance of customer retail repurchase agreements increased million while the average balance of the wholesale borrowings from brokers decreased million 
the average rat e paid on other borrowings was in the year ended december   compared to in other borrowings generally have relatively short terms and therefore reprice to current market levels more quickly than deposits and fhlb advances  which generally lag current market rates  although  similar to deposits  customer retail repurchase agreements have a lower degree of volatility than most market rates 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million compared to million from the prior year 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the provision and allowance for loan losses is one of the most critical accounting estimates included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves as more fully explained below 
the provision in the current year reflects a reduced amount of net charge offs  balanced against modestly higher levels of non performing loans  growth in the size of our loan portfolio and continuing changes in the loan mix 
there were net charge offs of  for the current year  compared to million of charges for the prior year  and non performing loans increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  generally  these non performing loans reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower rather than weakness in the overall economy of the pacific northwest  housing or real estate markets  or depressed farm commodity prices or adverse growing conditions 
a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and shows an increase of million to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans rece ivable excluding allowance for losses was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans decreased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral for the loan 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent in all material respects with the gaap guidelines outlined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we have established systematic methodologies for the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
the methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual problem loans 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for probable loan losses against our income and value impaired loans consistent with the guidelines in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon management s continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
realized losses related to specific assets are applied as a reduction of the carrying value of the assets and charged immediately against the allowance for loan loss reserve 
recoveries on previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
the reserve is based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time financial statements are prepa red 
although management uses the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond our control 
the adequacy of general and specific reserves is based on management s continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio  including changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience and current economic conditions  as well as individual review of certain large balance loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment include residential real estate and consumer loans and  as appropriate  smaller balance non homogeneous loans 
larger balance non homogeneous residential construction and land  commercial real estate  commercial business loans and unsecured loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
loans are consider ed impaired when  based on current information and events  management determines that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  the financial condition of the borrower  value of the underlying collateral and current status of the economy 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
subsequent changes in the value of impaired loans are included within the provision for loan losses in the same manner in which impairment initially was recognized or as a reduction in the provision that would otherwise be reported 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans as defined by sfas no 
and had established million of loss allowances related to these loans 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances  an allocated formula allowance and an unallocated allowance 
losses on specific loans are provided for when the losses are probable and estimable 
general loan loss reserves are established to provide for inherent loan portfolio risks not specifically provided for 
the level of general reserves is based on analysis of potential exposures existing in our loan portfolio including evaluation of historical trends  current market conditions and other relevant factors identified by management at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans  excluding loans with specific allowances 
loss factors are based on our historical loss experience adjusted for significant factors including the experience of other banking organizations that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibil ity of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the unallocated allowance is based upon management s evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
this methodology may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided in the financial statements 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of banner bank s allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table sets forth an analysis of the company s allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated dollars in thousands table changes in allowance for loan losses years ended december balance  beginning of period allowances added through business combinations provision recoveries of loans previously charged off secured by real estate one to four family commercial multifamily construction and land commercial business agricultural business consumer loans charged off secured by real estate one to four family commercial multifamily construction and land commercial business agricultural business consumer net charge offs balance  end of period ratio of allowance to net loans before allowance for loan losses ratio of net loan charge offs to the average net book value of loans outstanding during the period ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated dollars in thousands table allocation of allowance for loan losses at december amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans specific or allocated loss allowances loans secured by real estate commercial multifamily construction and land one to four family including consumer commercial agricultural business consumer unallocated general loss allowance n a n a n a n a n a total allowance for loan losses we establish specific loss allowances when individual loans are identified that present a possibility of loss ie  that full collectibility is not reasonably assured 
the remainder of the allocated and unallocated allowance for loan losses is established for the purpose of providing for estimated losses which are inherent in the loan portfolio 
other operating income 
other operating income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year 
however  in the fourth quarter of  as a part of our balance sheet restructuring initiatives  we recorded million of net loss on the sale of securities 
excluding the net loss on the sale of securities relating to the balance sheet restructuring transactions  total other operating income would have been million for the year ended december   resulting in a million increase in recurring other operating income for as compared to deposit fees and other service charge income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  primarily reflecting growth in customer transaction accounts and increased merchant credit card services  although changes in certain pricing schedules also contributed to the increase 
loan serv icing fees decreased by  to million for the current year  from million for the year ended december   when we received a higher amount of prepayment fees 
gain on sale of loans was relatively unchanged  increasing by  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year as our mortgage banking activity maintained a similar pace despite modestly higher mortgage rates 
gain on sale of loans was adversely affected by continued competitive pressures in the mortgage market which tended to reduce the margin on sales compared to the prior year 
however  in addition to normal mortgage banking activity  gain on sale of loans was augmented modestly in the third quarter of by the sale of approximately million of one to four family loans that had previously been included in the held for portfolio portion of loans receivable 
this sale was initiated for liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes  however  it generated a gain of  loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the prior year 
gain on sale of loans in included  of fees on million of loans which were brokered and are not reflected in the volume of loans sold 
the current year also included a gain of  on the sale of the guaranteed portion of certain sba guaranteed loans  while no similar sales activity occurred in the previous year 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
our total operating expenses in were significantly reduced by a net million insurance recovery which occurred in the second quarter of  while previous year total operating expenses include million of fhlb prepayment penalties associated with our balance sheet restructuring in the fourth quarter of excluding the insurance recovery and prior year prepayment penalties  recurring operating expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase of largely results from our branch expansion strategy and increased loan origination activity 
the increase in expenses includes operating costs associated with the opening of two new offices in and eight offices in that in each case contributed less than a full year s e xpense during the year in which they opened 
further  during the third quarter of  we increased staffing to support our small business administration sba lending activities and to more effectively market cash management services 
in addition  compensation was higher as a result of increased mortgage loan commissions and general wage and salary increases  as well as increased costs associated with employee benefit programs and employer paid taxes 
these increases were mitigated to a degree by an increase in the amount of capitalized loan origination costs  which reflects increases in both the cost to produce and the volume of new loan originations 
we also continued our strong commitment to advertising and marketing expenditures  which were million in the year ended december   an increase of  compared to the prior year 
reflecting the current year insurance recovery and the prior year fhlb prepayment penalty  as well as significant growth in the average asset base  other operating expenses as a percentage of average assets decreased to for the year ended december   from for the prior year 
our efficiency ratio also decreased to for the year ended december  from for  as a higher level of revenues more than offset the increased operating expenses 
excluding the effects of the insurance recovery and the balance sheet restructuring charges  the ratio of recurring operating expenses to average assets was nearly unchanged at for compared to for  while the efficiency ratio decreased to from  respectively  despite continuing start up costs associated with branch growth 
we expect continued increases in the absolute level of operating expenses as a result of our announced expansion plans  however  over time  management believes that this investment in our branch network may lead to a lower relative cost of funds and enhanced revenues which should result in an improved efficiency ratio and stronger operating resu lts 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the company s effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in both years reflect the recording of tax credits related to certain community reinvestment act cra investments 
the higher effective tax rate in the current year was primarily a result of a decrease in the relative combined effect of the tax credits from cra investments and tax exempt income from interest on municipal securities and earnings on bank owned life insurance  compared to other taxable net revenue sources which increased substantially reflecting the growth in loans and deposits and the effects of the current year insurance recovery and prior year balance sheet restructuring 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  late in the fourth quarter of  we completed a balance sheet restructuring designed to pay down high interest rate fhlb borrowings and reduce the size of the investment portfolio 
to effect the restructuring  we sold million of securities at a million loss before tax and used a portion of the proceeds of the sale to prepay million of high cost fixed term fhlb borrowings  incurring pre tax prepayment penalties of million 
the total cost of the transactions was million  with a tax benefit of million  resulting in an after tax cost of million or per diluted share 
for the year ended december   earnings from recurring operations  exclusive of the balance sheet restructuring transactions noted above  increased to million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share  for the year ended december  aside from the balance sheet restructuring transactions  our operating results reflect significant growth of loans and deposits  as well as an increase in the net interest margin  and a lower level of loan loss provision 
in addition  our operating results reflect that other operating income  exclusive of the net loss on sale of securities relating to the balance sheet restructuring  increased primarily as a result of an increase in deposit fees and other service charges  and that other operating expenses  excluding the fhlb prepayment penalties  also significantly increased  particularly compensation  occupancy  information services and advertising expenses 
compared to levels a year earlier  total assets increased  to billion at december   net loans increased  to billion  deposits grew  to billion  and borrowings  including junior subordinated debentures  decreased  to million 
average interest earning assets were billion for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the same period a year earlier 
average equity was of average assets for the year ended december   compared to of average assets for the year ended december   reflecting increased balance sheet leverage 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   largely as a result of the growth in average interest earning assets noted above 
for the year ended december   the net interest margin increased to from for the prior year 
this improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects changes in both the asset and liability mix  although the lagged effect of increasing market interest rates on deposit costs also contributed to the improvement 
in particular  the average asset mix for the year ended december  reflected proportionately more loans  including more higher yielding commercial  construction and land development loans  and fewer investment securities than for the year ended december  at the same time  the average funding liability base had proportionately more deposits  including more non interest bearing deposits  and proportionately fewer borrowings than in the prior year 
the balance sheet restructuring transactions that we completed late in the fourth quarter had only a minor effect on the net interest margin  however  they furthered these changes in the asset and liability mix and significantly contributed to expansion of the net interest margin in in contrast with the prior year and as more fully explained below  for the year ended december  we did not record any dividend income on its investment in stock of the fhlb 
dividend income on the fhlb stock contributed five basis points to the net interest margin in the year ended december  this loss of dividend income on fhlb stock masked to a degree the progress we made in in improving the net interest margin from our core businesses of making loans to and collecting deposits from banking customers 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest income occurred as a result of a basis point increase in the average yield on interest earning assets  as well as significant growth in those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the year ended december  interest income on loans for the year increased by million  or  to million from million for the prior year  reflecting the impact of the increase in average loan balances combined with a basis point increase in the average yield 
the increase in average loan yield refle cts the increases in the level of market interest rates during the year  particularly in short term interest rates including the prime rate and libor indices which affect large portions of construction  land development  commercial and agricultural loans 
the increase in average loan yields also reflects changes in the mix of the loan portfolio 
the average yield on loans was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  while the level of short term market interest rates was significantly higher than a year earlier  loan yields did not change to the same degree  as existing fixed rate loans did not adjust upward and offering rates for new fixed rate loans remained relatively low as the yield curve continued to flatten 
in addition  changes in the average credit risk profile of new borrowers and competitive pricing pressure resulted in lower spreads and yields on new loan originations 
these factors were somewhat offset by changes in the loan mix  as grow th was most significant in some of the higher yielding adjustable rate loan categories 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock decreased by million for the year ended december   and the interest and dividend income from those investments decreased by million compared to the year ended december  the average yield on mortgage backed securities increased to for the year ended december   from for the prior year  reflecting reduced amortization of purchase premiums on certain portions of the portfolio as well as a reduction in the adverse effects of delayed receipt of principal payments on mortgage backed securities as a result of slower prepayments and modestly higher rates on the small portion of mortgage backed securities that have adjustable interest rates 
the average yield on other investment securities and cash equivalents increased to for the year ended december   from for the prior year  largely reflecting the effec t of higher market rates on certain adjustable rate securities 
despite a  increase in the average balance invested  we did not record any dividend income from fhlb stock for the year ended december  by contrast  fhlb stock dividend income in the prior year was million 
previously  dividends on fhlb stock had been established on a quarterly basis by vote of the directors of the fhlb of seattle  however  during the quarter ended december   the fhlb of seattle announced that future dividends would be restricted while the fhlb attempted to improve its capital position 
in the fourth quarter of  the fhlb resumed paying dividends  although at a much reduced level compared to what was paid in and earlier periods 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense was the result of the significant growth in interest bearing liabilities combined with a basis point increase in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from for the prior year  reflecting the higher levels of market interest rates and the maturity of certain lower costing certificates of deposit and fixed rate borrowings 
deposit interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year  as a result of the significant deposit growth as well as an increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits 
reflecting the branch expansion and other growth initiatives  average deposit balances increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances increased basis points to 
although deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interes t rates  changes in the average rate paid for deposits tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing was evident in the modest increase in deposit costs as the federal reserve moved to increase short term interest rates by basis points from june to december average fhlb advances totaled million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  which was offset by the effects of a basis point increase in the average cost of advances  resulting in a million increase in related interest expense 
the average rate paid on fhlb advances increased to for the year ended december   from for year ended december  while fhlb advances are generally fixed rate  fixed term borrowings  many of our more recent advances carried relatively shorter terms and were established in periods when market rates were lower 
reflecting the maturity and repricing of these short term advances  the increased cost in reflects new advances at then higher current market rates 
junior subordinated debentures had an average balance of million and an average cost of including amortization of prepaid underwriting costs for t he year ended december  junior subordinated debentures outstanding at the end of the prior year had an average balance of million but a much lower average rate of 
the junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three to six months 
the increased cost of the junior subordinated debentures reflects increases in short term market interest rates 
other borrowings primarily consist of retail repurchase agreements with customers and reverse repurchase agreements with investment banking firms secured by certain investment securities 
the average balance for other borrowings decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in  while the related interest expense increased  to million from million for the respective periods 
the average balance of the wholesale borrowings from brokers decreased million  which was nearly offset by a mill ion increase in the average balance of customer retail repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings 
the average rate paid on other borrowings was in the year ended december   compared to for provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  the provision in the current year reflects lower levels of non performing loans  improvement in the economic environment and strengthening in the prospects for collection on previously identified non performing loans  balanced against changes in the mix and growth in the size of the loan portfolio 
while net charge offs were million in  compared to million for the prior year  non performing loans decreased million to million at december   compared to million at december  for the two year period  non performing loans were primarily concentrated in a few agricultural loans and agricultural related business loans due from borrowers located in northeastern oregon 
generally  these problem loans reflected unique operating diff iculties for the individual borrower rather than a weakness in the overall economy of the area  farm commodity prices or growing conditions 
a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and shows an increase of million to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans increased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans as defined by sfas no 
and had established million of specific reserves for these loans 
other operating income 
other operating income was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the prior year 
however  as noted above  in the fourth quarter of  as a part of its balance sheet restructuring initiatives  we recorded million of net loss on the sale of securities 
excluding the net loss on the sale of securities relating to the balance sheet restructuring transactions  total other operating income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  importantly  deposit fee and service charge income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  primarily reflecting growth in customer transaction accounts and increased merchant credit card services  although changes in certain pricing schedules also contributed to the increase 
on the other hand  loan servici ng fees declined by  to million for the current year  from million for the year ended december   as the portfolio of serviced loans decreased modestly and prepayment fees and other servicing charges declined 
partially offsetting the decline in loan servicing fees was a small improvement in the gain on sale of loans  which increased by  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year as mortgage banking activity improved modestly 
gain on sale of loans was somewhat adversely affected by the increase in capitalized loan origination costs discussed in the following paragraph  which had the effect of increasing the cost basis in loans held for sale  as well as by competitive pressures in the mortgage market which tended to reduce the margin on sales compared to the prior year 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  gain on sale of l oans included  of fees on million of loans which were brokered and are not reflected in the volume of loans sold 
other miscellaneous income decreased  principally due to a decrease in the earnings from life insurance policies 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  included in this amount is million in penalties for the early prepayment of certain fhlb advances incurred in connection with the balance sheet restructuring initiatives 
excluding these prepayment penalties  other operating expense increase million  or  compared to the prior year other operating expenses reflect the growth in assets and liabilities  customer relationships and complexity of operations as we continued to expand 
the higher level of operating expenses in included significant increases in compensation  occupancy and information services for additional branch  deposit services and commercial loan expansion to position us for future growth 
in addition  compensation was higher as a result of increased mortgage loan commissions and general wage and salary increases  as well as increased costs associated with employee benefit programs and employer paid taxes 
these increases were mitigated to a degree by an increase in the amount of capitalized loan origination costs  which reflected increases in both the cost to produce and the volume of new loan originations 
we also continued to increase our commitment to advertising and marketing  as expenditures for these items were million greater in the year ended december  than in the prior year 
the increase in expenses included operating costs associated with the opening of fourteen new branch offices at various times during and  as well as costs associated with relocating or upgrading five additional offices over the same period 
our efficiency ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year  in large part reflecting the fhlb prepayment penalties and the related loss on sale of securities  but also reflecting the start up costs associated with this branch growth 
other operating expenses as a percentage of average assets increased to for the year ende d december  from in the prior year 
excluding the effects of the balance sheet restructuring charges  for the year ended december   the efficiency ratio and ratio of other operating expense to average assets would have been and  respectively 
income taxes income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in was primarily a result of a decrease in the relative amount of taxable income versus tax exempt income compared to the prior year which occurred as a result of the charges associated with the balance sheet restructuring transactions

market risk and asset liability management our financial condition and operations are influenced significantly by general economic conditions  including the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received from our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest bearing liabilities 
our activities  like all financial institutions  inherently involve the assumption of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on the institution s earnings and underlying economic value 
interest rate risk is determined by the maturity and repricing characteristics of an institution s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
interest rate risk is measured by the variability of financial performance and economic value resulting from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting our financial performance 
the greatest source of interest rate risk to us results from the mismatch of maturities or repricing intervals for rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
this mismatch or gap is generally characterized by a substantially shorter maturity structure for interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets 
additional interest rate risk results from mismatched repricing indices and formulae basis risk and yield curve risk  and product caps and floors and early repayment or withdrawal provisions option risk  which may be contractual or market driven  that are generally more favorable to customers than to us 
an exception to this generalization is the beneficial effect of interest rate floors on many of our floating rate loans  which help us maintain higher loan yields in periods when market interest rates decline significantly 
however  as of december   we have very few floating rate loans with interest rates that had not increased to levels above their floors and therefore these loans should be responsive to modest decreases or increases in market rates should they occur 
an additional exception to the generalization has been the beneficial effect of lagging and somewhat inelastic pricing adjustments for interest rates on certain deposit products in the current rising market interest rate environment 
this beneficial effect is particularly relevant to the administered rates paid on certain checking  savings and money market accounts and contributed to our expanded net interest margin for the years ended december  and however  since the federal reserve ceased increasing market interest rates in june  this lag effect has contributed to the recent narrowing of the net interest spread as deposit costs have continued to increase while asset yields have stabilized 
the principal objectives of asset liability management are to evaluate the interest rate risk exposure  to determine the level of risk appropriate given our operating environment  business plan strategies  performance objectives  capital and liquidity constraints  and asset and liability allocation alternatives  and to manage our interest rate risk consistent with regulatory guidelines and policies approved by the board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our earnings and capital position to changes in the level of interest rates 
our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee  which is comprised of members of our senior management 
the committee closely monitors our interest sensitivity exposure  asset and liability allocation decisions  liquidity and capital positions  and local and national economic conditions and attempts to structure the loan and investment portfolios and funding sources to maximize earnings within acceptable risk tolerances 
sensitivity analysis our primary monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is asset liability simulation modeling  which is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  interest rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income resulting from those movements under different rate environments 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in the modeled interest rate environments provides a measurement of interest rate risk 
we also utilize market value analysis  which addresses changes in estimated net market value of equity arising from changes in the level of interest rates 
the net market value of equity is estimated by separately valuing our assets and liabilities under varying interest rate environments 
the extent to which assets gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liability values under the various interest rate assumptions determines the sensitivity of net equity value to changes in interest rates and provides an additional measure of inte rest rate risk 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis performed by us incorporates beginning of the period rate  balance and maturity data  using various levels of aggregation of that data  as well as certain assumptions concerning the maturity  repricing  amortization and prepayment characteristics of loans and other interest earning assets and the repricing and withdrawal of deposits and other interest bearing liabilities into an asset liability computer simulation model 
we update and prepare simulation modeling at least quarterly for review by senior management and the directors 
we believe the data and assumptions are realistic representations of our portfolio and possible outcomes under the various interest rate scenarios 
nonetheless  the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income and net market value of equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
tables and a  interest rate risk indicators  set forth as of december  and  the estimated changes in our net interest income over a one year time horizon and the estimated changes in market value of equity based on the indicated interest rate environments

another although less reliable monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice  based upon certain assumptions  within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest s ensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
certain shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of some borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a severe interest rate increase 
tables and a  interest sensitivity gap  present our interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and the tables set forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which are anticipated by us  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future periods shown

although regular savings  demand  now  and money market deposit accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  based on historical experience management considers a substantial amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer maturities 
for the purpose of the gap analysis  these accounts have been assigned decay rates to reflect their longer effective maturities

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  proceeds from loan principal and interest payments and sales of loans  and the maturity of and interest income on mortgage backed and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our primary investing activity is the origination and purchase of loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased loans of million  million and million  respectively  while loan originations  net of repayments  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
this activity was funded primarily by principal repayments on loans and securities  sales of loans  and deposit growth

net deposit growth was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fhlb advances decreased million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other borrowings  including junior subordinated debentures  increased million for the year ended december   increased million for the year ende d december   and increased million for the year ended december  we must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to accommodate deposit withdrawals  to support loan growth  to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
during the years ended december   and  we used our sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments  to purchase securities  and to pay maturing savings certificates and deposit withdrawals 
at december   we had outstanding loan commitments totaling billion  including undisbursed loans in process and unused credit lines totaling billion 
while reflecting growth in the loan portfolio and lending activities  this level of commitments is proportionally consistent with our historical experience and does not represent a departure from normal operations 
we generally maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities to meet short term liquidity needs  however  our primary liquidity management practice is to in crease or decrease short term borrowings  including fhlb advances 
we maintain a credit facility with the fhlb seattle  which provides for advances that in the aggregate may equal the lesser of of banner bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral  up to a total possible credit line of million at december  advances under this credit facility totaled million  or of our assets  at december  we also have in place borrowing lines with certain correspondent banks with in aggregate total million  none of which was drawn upon as of december  at december   certificates of deposit amounted to billion  or of our total deposits  including billion which were scheduled to mature within one year 
while no assurance can be given as to future periods  historically  we have been able to retain a significant amount of its deposits as they mature

the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
