overview we own and operate the trump taj mahal casino resort  the trump plaza hotel and casino and the trump marina hotel casino in atlantic city  new jersey 
during we focused on property and operational changes 
we commenced the million first phase of our renovation capital program  began construction of a new  million  room hotel tower at the taj mahal  completed the installation of a company wide data warehouse  and completed the installation of a hotel yield management system 
we also introduced several labor efficiency programs and increased cash room  food and beverage revenues by approximately million 
the results of our operations were negatively impacted during the year ended december  due to the closure of our casino operations as a result of the state of new jersey government closure for three days during early july while our hotel and some or our food and beverage operations remained open  the closure of our casino operations for this three day period reduced our overall casino revenues 
additionally  we believe our casino and other revenues for the two week period after this closing were also negatively impacted due to the closure 
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements for periods from the filing of the chapter petition through the emergence from chapter were prepared in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code sop 
sop required separate reporting of certain expenses relating to the predecessor company s chapter filings as reorganization items 
upon emergence from chapter  we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with sop under fresh start reporting  a new entity was deemed to have been created for financial reporting purposes and the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities were adjusted to reflect their estimated fair values 

table of contents as a result of the adoption of fresh start reporting  the reorganized company s post emergence financial statements are generally not comparable with the financial statements of the predecessor company prior to its emergence from bankruptcy  including the historical financial statements included in this report 
due to the adoption of fresh start reporting  the predecessor and reorganized company financial statements are prepared on different bases 
for the purposes of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have combined the period from january  through may  predecessor company and the period from may  through december  reorganized company into the year ended december  this combination was performed as we believe it provides for the best comparison of our operating performance for the respective periods 
differences occurring in the periods which were caused by the financial statements being prepared on different bases of accounting are indicated in the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources general 
cash flows from the operating activities of our casino properties along with borrowings under our revolving credit facility generally constitute our primary source of liquidity 
we achieved a significant increase in financial flexibility and a meaningful reduction in interest expense as a result of our may  debt restructuring and emergence from bankruptcy 
our management has implemented programs to improve operating cash flow and will continue to attempt to implement such programs in the upcoming years 
these programs include  among others  labor savings through headcount reductions  a more efficient management structure and employee scheduling  changes to our marketing programs and better management of our hotel room blocks 
based upon our current implementation of these programs and current and planned capital expenditures  we expect continued improvement in our cash flows from operations over time resulting in positive cash flows from operations 
however  we cannot assure you that these programs will be successful or sustainable 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million during compared to cash flow used by operating activities of million during this increase in our cash flow from operations reflects improved operating results and lower interest expense following our reorganization 
during  we used million for investing activities primarily for capital expenditures relating to renovation and updating of our facilities 
these capital expenditures were funded by our available cash and cash flow from operations 
our cash flows provided by investing activities for included million in proceeds from the sale of trump indiana 
following our sale of trump indiana  million of the proceeds were deposited in a cash escrow account pending the finalization of certain adjustments under the sale agreement 
excluding the proceeds from the sale of trump indiana and the change in restricted cash  cash used in investing activities increased by million in  primarily as a result of increases in our capital expenditures

as of march   subject to the limitations imposed by our debt incurrence covenant  availability under the credit facility was approximately million

while we believe that our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our cash obligations during the next twelve months  our ability to meet our operating and debt service obligations depends on a number of factors  including our existing cash on hand  cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries and compliance with our debt covenants 
we continuously seek investment opportunities in an effort to expand our business beyond our existing properties

critical accounting estimates general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
of our accounting estimates  we believe the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill we have approximately million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet at december  we regularly evaluate our businesses for potential impairment indicators 
additionally  we perform impairment testing at least annually 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on  among other things  the regulatory and competitive status and operational performance of each of our businesses 
future events  such as the failure to meet or exceed our operating plans  increased competition or the enactment of increased gaming tax rates  could significantly impact our judgments and any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment our operations are capital intensive and we make capital investments at each of our properties in the form of maintenance capital and  from time to time  expansion and product enhancement capital 
at december   we have approximately  million of net property and equipment recorded on our balance sheet 
we depreciate our assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimates of the useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events  such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations  could result in a change in the manner in which we use certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
insurance accruals our insurance policies for employee health  workers compensation and general patron liabilities have significant deductible levels on an individual claim basis 
we accrue a liability for known workers compensation and general patron liabilities based upon a review of individual claims 
additionally  we accrue an amount for incurred but not reported claims based on our historical experience and other factors 
our employee health insurance benefit accrual is based on our historical claims experience rate including an estimated lag factor 
these accruals involve complex estimates and could be significantly affected should current claims vary from historical levels 
management reviews our insurance accruals for adequacy at the end of each reporting period 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by 
table of contents taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the examination issues are settled 
inflation there was no significant impact on operations as a result of inflation during  or item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments is the potential loss in fair value arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the following table also presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date of our debt obligations 
therafter total fixed rate debt maturities average interest rate variable rate debt maturities average interest rate we currently have no outstanding interest rate swaps 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to change the proportion of fixed to variable rate debt within parameters established by management 
in accordance with these parameters  the agreements are used to manage interest rate risks and cost inherent in our debt portfolio
