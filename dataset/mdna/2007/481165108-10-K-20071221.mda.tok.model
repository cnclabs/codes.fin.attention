dollar amounts are in thousands  except share and per share data and as indicated 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations  financial position  cash flows  indebtedness  and other key financial information of joy global inc and its subsidiaries for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal for a more complete understanding of this discussion  please read the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
overview we are the direct successor to businesses that have been manufacturing mining equipment for over years 
we operate in two business segments underground mining machinery  comprised of our joy mining machinery business joy  and surface mining equipment  comprised of our p h mining equipment business p h 
joy is the world s largest producer of high productivity underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal 
p h is the world s largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a leading producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills  used primarily for surface mining copper  coal  iron ore  oil sands  and other minerals 
in addition to selling new equipment  we provide parts  components  repairs  rebuilds  diagnostic analysis  fabrication  training  and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines 
in the case of surface mining equipment  we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies  including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as alliance partners 
we emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business 
demand for new equipment is cyclical in nature  being driven by commodity prices and other factors 
original equipment sales have ranged from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our aftermarket business has shown more consistent growth since fiscal with sales ranging from million in to billion in fiscal along with record revenues in fiscal  our backlog has also continued to grow 
our backlog of billion as of october  increased to billion as of october  driven by increased original equipment orders for expansion projects as well as aftermarket products and services to support the high utilization of the current installed fleet 
the continued strength and positive long term outlook of commodity markets  including those for copper  iron ore  oil sands  and international coal  support sustained demand for our original equipment and aftermarket services 
sustained demand for our equipment and aftermarket services globally has led to further expansion plans in fiscal consistent with our plan to expand manufacturing in low cost regions of the world  the surface mining business broke ground on a facility in tianjin  china which will expand our proprietary component machining capabilities 
the surface mining business also continued to expand its presence and capabilities at mine sites through field service extensions in the southwest region of the united states and in australia 
the underground mining business continues to make significant investments in china  with the newly constructed manufacturing facility in tianjin producing its first set of armored face conveyor pan lines 
the underground business also expanded its manufacturing and service center capabilities with the completion of a facility in poland 
fiscal continues to support a prolonged commodity growth cycle 
global commodities have continued to show strength  and the global economy is looking to maintain to growth  led by china and india with expected growth of to  respectively 
international coal  copper  iron ore  and oil sands continue to trade near historical highs and as a result continued investment in new projects is needed to support global demand 
the us underground coal market has started to show early signs of recovery  but will continue to be impacted by current and future energy regulations 
page approximately of our sales in fiscal were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service 
the remaining of sales was recorded using percentage of completion accounting  a practice we follow in recognizing revenue on the sale of long lead time equipment such as electric mining shovels  walking draglines and powered roof support systems 
under percentage of completion accounting  revenue is recognized on firm orders from customers as the product is manufactured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs to be incurred 
we generally receive progress payments on long lead time equipment 
operating results of fiscal were indicative of the volatility associated with the commodity markets 
net sales for fiscal totaled billion  compared with billion in fiscal the acquisition of stamler in the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal added million in fiscal and the continued strength of all surface markets added million  while us underground activity partially offset this increase by million 
our gross profit margin in fiscal increased to from in fiscal due to the continued strength of commodity markets  a heavier mix of aftermarket products and services and disciplined cost control 
operating income totaled million in fiscal  up million from fiscal the increase in operating income was the result of increased sales related to strong international demand and the inclusion of stamler in the full year  offset by increased warranty costs of million  increased costs of million associated with the stamler acquisition  and costs of million associated with our continuing investment in china 
net income was million  or per diluted share in fiscal compared with million or per diluted share in the prior year 
net income in the prior year was benefited from a reversal of certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances of million 
reorganization income also benefited the prior year by million related to a settled claim by a former subsidiary 
results of operations compared with sales the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal net sales as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal in thousands change change net sales underground mining machinery surface mining equipment total the slight decrease in net sales for underground mining machinery in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million decrease in original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket products and service 
weakness in the central appalachia region of the united states resulted in a decrease across substantially all original equipment product lines 
china s original equipment sales also decreased primarily due to lower armored face conveyor and powered roof support sales and on more local competition 
offsetting the impact of the united states and china  increased original equipment sales were reported in australia and associated with stamler 
international aftermarket sales increased in south africa and china reflecting continued high level of coal mining activity on a global basis 
the increase in net sales for surface mining equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket parts and service 
increases in original equipment sales due to timing of production schedules primarily consisted of increased shovel revenue in two key markets  the canadian oil sands and china 
aftermarket sales increases were primarily page due to million in emerging markets and million in the united states and most notably in the southwest region of the united states 
the emerging market increase is primarily related to continued strength of coal markets in china and russia  while the southwest increase was due to the continued global demand for copper 
operating income the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal operating income as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal operating operating in thousands income loss of net sales income loss of net sales operating income loss underground mining machinery surface mining equipment corporate expense total operating income as a percentage of net sales for underground mining machinery decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in operating income was principally due to increased warranty expense of million and increased product development  selling and administrative expense of million offset by a greater mix of higher margin aftermarket sales and decreased incentive compensation expense 
the increase in product development  selling and administrative expense was related to international infrastructure development  the inclusion of stamler for all of fiscal  and increased pension expense 
operating income as a percentage of net sales for surface mining equipment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in operating income was principally due to increased sales volume of million and a more profitable mix of original equipment and aftermarket sales 
product development  selling and administrative expenses were up approximately million in fiscal  but were down percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year 
product development  selling and administrative expense product development  selling and administrative expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in product development  selling and administrative expense was primarily due to million of increased warranty costs  million of costs related to the development and expansion of global infrastructure  million of expenses related to the inclusion of stamler for all of fiscal  million of foreign exchange impact  million increase in pension expense  and general inflation 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in incentive based compensation expense 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the million increase was principally due to the november issuance of million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due the proceeds from the notes were primarily used to finance our common stock repurchase program and to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
reorganization items reorganization items include income and expenses that were realized or incurred as a result of our reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
fiscal reorganization related items included the resolution of a contingent payable of million partially offset by continuing professional fees related to the page reorganization of million 
fiscal reorganization items included million of income related to a beloit claim settlement 
provision for income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal and fiscal were approximately and  respectively 
consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the main drivers of the variance in tax rates and income tax expense were us subpart f earnings  us state income taxes  mix of earnings year over year  differences in local statutory tax rates and the reversal of certain us and australian deferred income tax valuation reserves in fiscal fiscal also included tax adjustments of million which included taxes on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries during the quarter not previously forecasted  the resolution of an r d study which resulted in the write off of pre bankruptcy r d credits  and a reserve added following the quarterly evaluation of a previously disclosed contingent tax liability in south africa 
a review of income tax valuation reserves was performed throughout fiscal as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of million was recorded on a global basis 
for fiscal  a tax benefit of million was recorded relating to the reversal of certain valuation reserves  principally million applicable to us deferred income tax assets and million related to certain deferred income tax assets applicable to our australian consolidated tax group 
compared with sales the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal net sales as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal in thousands change change net sales underground mining machinery surface mining equipment total total net sales for fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal net sales 
the increase in net sales for underground mining machinery in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in shipments of original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket products and service 
with the exception of roof supports sales  which were flat with fiscal  increases in original equipment sales were reported across all original equipment product lines 
the united states represented million of the increase in original equipment sales 
increases in aftermarket net sales were reported in all of our markets 
aftermarket sales increases ranging from approximately in the united states to approximately in emerging markets served out of the united kingdom reflected the high level of coal mining activity on a global basis and more specifically  from our international markets 
the increase in net sales for surface mining equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket parts and service 
increases in original equipment sales were reported in the united states  australia  chile  venezuela  south africa  and china offset by decreased equipment sales in canada and mexico 
almost two thirds of the original equipment increase related to electric mining shovels 
increases in aftermarket sales were reported for all of our page significant markets 
aftermarket sales increases ranging from approximately in south africa to approximately in canada reflected the high level of copper  coal mining  and iron ore mining activity on a global basis and the high level of oil sands mining activity in canada 
operating income the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal operating income as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal operating operating in thousands income loss of net sales income loss of net sales operating income loss underground mining machinery surface mining equipment corporate expense total operating income as a percentage of net sales for underground mining machinery increased from in fiscal to in fiscal a more profitable mix of original equipment sales accounted for percentage points of the change 
product development  selling and administrative expenses were up approximately million in fiscal  but were down percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year 
operating income as a percentage of net sales for surface mining equipment increased from in fiscal to in fiscal a more profitable mix of original equipment and aftermarket sales contributed to percentage points of the increase 
product development  selling and administrative expenses were up approximately million in fiscal  but were down percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year 
product development  selling and administrative expense product development  selling and administrative expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in product development  selling and administrative expense was due primarily to a million increase in pension expense and million increase in selling expenses related to increased business activity and general inflation  offset by million decrease in legal expense associated with an arbitration award and associated legal fees incurred in fiscal interest expense interest expense for fiscal decreased to million as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to our repurchase of substantially all of our senior subordinated notes in june offset by direct borrowings during the second half of fiscal under our revolving credit agreement 
the direct borrowings under our revolving credit agreement were used to finance our common stock repurchase program and our fourth quarter acquisition of the stamler business 
cash interest paid in fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
provision for income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the main drivers of the variance in effective tax page rates and income tax expense were the reversal of certain us and australian deferred tax asset valuation reserves  subpart f earnings  us state income taxes  increased global profitability and mix of earnings year over year and differences in local statutory tax rates 
reorganization items reorganization items include income  expenses  and losses that were realized or incurred by the predecessor company as a result of its decision to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
net reorganization items for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal consisted of the following fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands income expense resolution of contingent payable beloit uk claim settlement professional fees directly related to the reorganization professional fees reimbursement legal reserve reversal other net net reorganization income critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  excess inventory  warranty  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment and passage of title for sales of products and at the time of performance for sales of services 
we recognize revenue on long term contracts  such as the manufacture of mining shovels  drills  draglines and roof support systems  using either the percentage of completion or inventory sales methods 
when using the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
estimated losses are recognized in full when identified 
we have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of to years 
these contracts are set up based on the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms 
accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates  including estimates of the relevant machine s long term maintenance requirements 
under these contracts  customers are generally billed monthly and the respective deferred revenues are recorded when billed 
revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided 
these contracts are reviewed periodically and revenue recognition page is adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs 
if a loss is expected at any time  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
in limited circumstances  we have customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the agreements are considered for multiple elements based on the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values 
revenue recognition involves judgments  assessments of expected returns  the likelihood of nonpayment  and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions  in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method for all inventories 
we evaluate the need to record adjustments for inventory on a regular basis 
our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts 
inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses  and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include drawings  patents  trademarks  technology  customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized 
these assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  which is principally the straight line method 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach  in accordance with statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
management judgment is used in the development of assumptions in the impairment testing process  including growth and discount rate assumptions 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal and no impairment was identified 
accrued warranties we record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
page pension and postretirement benefits and costs we have pension and postretirement benefits and expenses which are developed from actuarial valuations 
these valuations are based on assumptions including  among other things  discount rates  expected returns on plan assets  retirement ages  years of service  future salary increases  and future health care cost trend rates 
future changes affecting the assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense 
as such  a 
change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense  respectively  as of and for the fiscal year ended october  
increase 
decrease expected expected discount long term discount long term in thousands rate rate of return rate rate of return u 
s pension plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation non us pension plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation other postretirement benefit plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates 
deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period  adjusted for certain reclassifications under fresh start accounting 
additionally  we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria 
as required under the application of fresh start accounting  the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted  then intangibles until exhausted  and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital 
consequently  a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized 
we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained 
as of october   there were million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards 
all future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be reversed to additional paid in capital 
similar to the treatment of pre emergence deferred tax valuation reserves  amounts reserved pre emergence relating to future income tax contingencies also require special treatment under fresh start accounting 
reversals of tax contingency reserves that are no longer required due to the resolution of the underlying tax issue and were recorded at the emergence date will first reduce any excess reorganization value until exhausted  then other intangibles until exhausted  and thereafter are reported as an adjustment to income tax expense 
consistent with prior years  we have reviewed the amounts so reserved and adjusted the balances to the amounts deemed appropriate with the corresponding adjustment reported as an income tax benefit 
as of october   there were page million of accrued pre emergence income tax contingencies 
future reversals of pre emergence income tax contingencies will be recognized as a component of income tax expense in the period reversed 
we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year on an interim basis 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual results are different from these estimates  adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
additionally  discreet items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized 
to the extent recognized  these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow are two financial measurements that provide an indication of our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we currently use a combination of cash generated by operations  borrowings on our line of credit and debt offerings to fund continuing operations 
the following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital at the end of fiscal and fiscal october  october  in millions cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories other current assets short term debt accounts payable employee compensation and benefits advance payments and progress billings accrued warranties other accrued liabilities working capital we currently use working capital and cash flow production as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we continue to require working capital investment to maintain our position as a leading manufacturer and servicer of high productivity mining equipment 
the primary drivers of these requirements are funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories 
our position as a market leader in providing timely service and repair requires us to maintain a certain level of replacement parts 
as part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes  we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules 
we expect fiscal capital spending to be between and of sales 
this represents an increase from fiscal capital spending as a percentage of sales of  primarily due to initiatives to increase our manufacturing capacity in emerging markets and to further expand our aftermarket service capabilities 
in addition  cash is required for capital expenditures for the repair  replacement  and upgrading of existing facilities 
we have debt service requirements  including commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility and biannual interest payments due to holders of our senior subordinated notes issued in november we believe that cash generated from operations  together with borrowings available under our credit facility  page provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures 
in response to continued worldwide demand for mining equipment  we have made and are committed to make additional investments in both our surface and underground mining operations 
in fiscal  we completed a previously announced investment in our manufacturing facility in milwaukee 
with this expansion  along with our current outsourcing arrangements  this gives us the capacity to produce shovels a year 
also in fiscal  efforts commenced on a million expansion in proprietary component machining capabilities for p h mining at our tianjin  china campus  with start up being projected in spring  with full production targeted for the next phase of our expansion will be an approximately  square foot facility in china and will give us further transmission assembly capabilities 
we also continue to expand outsourcing arrangements for certain non proprietary p h components  such as large fabrications  in areas of the world in which the products are ultimately destined 
the underground mining business is also focusing its growth in lower cost regions of the world 
the baotou  china facility has been expanded by approximately  square feet  to provide increased repair and rebuild capacity 
the tianjin  china facility successfully produced its first set of armored face conveyor panlines for use in china 
with this major accomplishment  we are looking to produce panlines for all markets out of the tianjin facility in fiscal continuing with the focus on low cost regions of the world  we completed a  square foot combined service center and manufacturing facility in poland in the fourth quarter of fiscal as we look to provide more efficient operations amongst our customers and two operating segments  we are the in the process of consolidating six smaller existing facilities in australia into one combined underground and surface mining service center and manufacturing facility 
cash provided by operations for fiscal was million as compared to million provided by operations for fiscal the increase in our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to our continued focus on obtaining advance payments for original equipment 
the increase in advance payments was offset by further increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
inventory management and forecasting remains a key initiative for us in fiscal cash used by investment activities for fiscal was million as compared to million used by investment activities for fiscal the primary driver of the decrease in the use of cash by investing activities was the acquisition of the stamler business during the fourth quarter of for million 
for fiscal  we anticipate capital expenditures between million and million  primarily for the upgrade of existing facilities  machines tools related to the tianjin facility  completion of sap implementation  and other projects 
on july   we completed the acquisition of the net assets of the stamler mining equipment business from the oldenburg group  inc for million in cash 
stamler manufactures products used primarily in underground coal mining applications  including feeder breakers  battery haulers  and continuous haulage systems 
the stamler business is in line with our previously stated objective of adding bolt on products and services to our existing businesses 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal was million as compared to million used by financing activities for fiscal the cash used by financing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of the repurchase of outstanding stock of million and the repayment of all amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility offset by the issuance of million of senior subordinated bonds in early fiscal during fiscal  we contributed million to our worldwide pension plans compared to million during fiscal as a result of additional contributions in prior years  no contributions to qualified us plans were required in fiscal we do not expect any required contributions to us pension plans in fiscal while no contributions will be required in  we intend to make contributions to our employee pension plans of approximately million  primarily to plans outside of the united states 
beyond fiscal  the investment performance of the plans assets and the actual results of the other actuarial assumptions and most importantly  the page impact of the pension protection act of ppa will determine the funding requirements of the pension plans 
we do not believe the ppa will have a significant effect on our near term pension contributions 
credit facilities on november   we amended our million unsecured revolving credit facility credit agreement to extend the facility through november  and also to amend certain financial covenants  including the elimination of covenants restricting stock repurchases and limiting capital expenditures 
in fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of million related to deferred financing costs associated with the prior facility 
outstanding borrowings on the credit agreement bear interest equal to libor plus the applicable margin based on our credit rating to or the base rate defined as the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus  at our option 
we also pay a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage 
the credit agreement also restricts payments of dividends or other return of capital based on the consolidated leverage ratio 
on october   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit agreement and had no restriction on the payment of dividends or return of capital 
at october   no direct borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement 
outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement  which count toward the million credit limit  totaled million 
at october   there was million available for borrowings under the credit agreement 
in november  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes with interest on the notes being paid semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  starting on may  the notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future significant domestic subsidiaries see
