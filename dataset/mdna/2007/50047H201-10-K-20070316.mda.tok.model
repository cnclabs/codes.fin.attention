table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we currently own and operate restaurants located in nine states 
we offer freshly prepared food  personalized service  and a contemporary ambiance that create a satisfying yet affordable dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants with whom we compete 
our high volume upscale casual restaurants feature a diverse selection of mainstream american dishes as well as a variety of appetizers and entrees with an international influence  including an extensive selection of sushi items 
our menu items are freshly prepared and incorporate over signature sauces and dressings that we make from scratch  creating broad based appeal for the lifestyle and taste trends of a diverse group of guests 
our menu is standardized for all of our restaurants allowing us to deliver consistent quality meals 
we believe that our offerings and generous portions  combined with an average check during of approximately per guest  offers our guests an attractive price value proposition 
we continue to follow a disciplined growth plan focused largely on expanding our presence in new markets 
to date  we have funded our restaurant development  working capital  and general corporate needs with cash flows from operations  loans from affiliates  the sale of common and preferred stock  receipt of landlord tenant improvement allowances  and borrowings under equipment term loans 
we opened five of our restaurants during with new restaurants in dallas  texas  lincolnshire  illinois  houston  texas  oak brook  illinois  and naples  florida 
we opened one restaurant in austin  texas during and plan to open an additional five restaurants during  which will significantly expand our presence in new markets 
our goal is for our new restaurants to generate average annual unit volumes of million following months of operations 
we believe our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as guests begin to discover our concept and we begin to generate market awareness 
our restaurants are also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
despite our limited operating history  we have identified that sales in most of our restaurants typically are higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season 
we experience various trends in our operating cost structure 
cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least months generally trend consistent with restaurant sales  and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will generally take several months to achieve operating efficiencies and planned sales levels due to challenges typically associated with new restaurants  including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees  as well as other factors 
we expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant  but decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient operating that unit 
the majority of our general and administrative costs are fixed costs 
we expect our general and administrative spending to increase as we add corporate personnel and infrastructure to support our growth and the requirements associated with being a public company 
however  we expect our general and administrative costs to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as we leverage these investments and realize the benefits of higher sales volumes 
key measures we use to evaluate our company key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following number of restaurant openings 
number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period 

table of contents same store sales growth 
same store sales growth reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
in calculating same store sales growth  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
same store sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount 
menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount 
average unit volume 
average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for all of our restaurants open for at least months 
restaurant operating profit 
restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  and preopening expenses 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance 
we use restaurant operating profit as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors 
sales per square foot 
sales per square foot represents the restaurant sales for our restaurants open for at least months  divided by the total square feet for such restaurants 
key financial definitions restaurant sales 
restaurant sales includes gross food and beverage sales  net of promotions and discounts 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of food and beverage costs 
labor 
labor includes all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations 
occupancy 
occupancy includes all rent payments associated with the leasing of real estate  including base  percentage and straight line rent  property taxes  and common area maintenance expense 
we record tenant improvement allowances as a reduction of occupancy expense over the initial term of the lease 
restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating expenses consist of all other restaurant level operating costs  the major components of which are utilities  credit card fees  supplies  marketing  repair and maintenance  and other expenses 
other operating expenses contain both variable and fixed components 
general and administrative

components of this category include management and staff salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation and related employee benefits  travel  information systems  human resources  training  corporate rent  professional and consulting fees  and corporate insurance costs 
preopening expense 
preopening expense consists of costs incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and is comprised principally of manager salaries and relocation  payroll and related training costs for new employees  including practice and rehearsal of service activities  and rent expense incurred during construction 
we expense restaurant preopening expenses as incurred  and we expect preopening expenses to be similar for each new restaurant opening  which typically commences five months prior to a restaurant opening 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of property and equipment and gains and losses on disposal of assets 
we currently have no intangible assets or goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
interest income 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and investments 
interest expense 
interest expense includes the cost of servicing our debt obligations  including the amortization of debt discounts

restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million during from million during primarily as a result of a million increase associated with the opening of two restaurants during the second half of and five restaurants during  and a million increase related to a increase in same store sales 
the comparable restaurant sales also benefited from an effective menu price increase of approximately in addition to an increase in customer traffic 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to during from during the slight reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales was primarily the result of economies of scale in the purchasing of food and beverage products as well as more favorable meat pricing 
additionally  in our new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher during the first six months of operations versus our mature restaurants  as management teams become accustomed to predicting  managing and servicing sales volumes we expect at our restaurants 
labor 
labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during this increase was primarily due to higher average wages to attract and retain qualified restaurant managers and the impact of opening five new restaurants during as compared to two new restaurants during as our new restaurants generally experience higher labor costs for approximately six months after opening as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient operating that unit

prior to  rental costs incurred during a construction period were capitalized and amortized over the initial term of the lease agreement 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million during from million during the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of the additional depreciation and amortization on five restaurants opened in and two restaurants opened during the third quarter of  as well as accelerated depreciation related to the retrofit of our existing restaurants with a new point of sale system 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during the percentage increase is primarily due to higher average capital expenditures for two restaurants opened in the chicago market during and lower than average sales volumes at our sugar land  texas restaurant as well as the accelerated depreciation related to the point of sale system discussed above 
interest income 
interest income of million during increased million from primarily due to interest income earned from the investment of proceeds from our initial public offering completed in august interest expense 
interest expense was million during compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to a million non cash charge to interest expense recorded during from the conversion of our convertible subordinated promissory note  in addition to a reduction of interest expense on this note that was converted into common stock prior to our initial public offering

tax expense results from state income taxes due to multi state operations in states where no state net operating loss carryforwards exist 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of  available to offset future taxable income  subject to certain limitations 

table of contents potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the following timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  restaurant operating costs and preopening costs for our newly opened restaurants  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter  labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel  profitability of our restaurants  especially in new markets  increases and decreases in comparable restaurant sales  impairment of long lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures  changes in borrowings and interest rates  general economic conditions  weather conditions or natural disasters  timing of certain holidays  new or revised regulatory requirements and accounting pronouncements  changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions  and fluctuations in commodity prices 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season 
consequently  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of our investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely decrease

prior to our initial public offering  our main sources of liquidity and capital were cash flows from operations  loans from affiliates  the sale of common and preferred stock  receipt of landlord tenant improvement allowances  and borrowings under six separate equipment term loans 
we believe the proceeds from our initial public offering in august and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements through beyond additional financing will be needed to fund working capital and restaurant development and we intend to secure such financing during changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  or other events  including those described in item a  risk factors of this report may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing on an accelerated basis 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could impact negatively our growth plans  financial condition  and results of operations 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations or financial covenants and ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 

table of contents equipment loans as of december   we had five equipment term loans with lenders  each collateralized by restaurant equipment 
the outstanding principal balance under these loans aggregated million 
the loans bear interest at rates ranging from to and require monthly principal and interest payments aggregating approximately  the loans mature between june and june the loans also require us to maintain certain financial covenants calculated at the end of each calendar year  and we were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of december  cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the periods presented in thousands

investing activities 
we fund the development and construction of our new restaurants primarily with cash and short term investments 
net cash used for investing activities was million during  reflecting million for the funding of construction in progress and the purchase of property and equipment  the majority of which related to our five restaurant openings in and planned restaurant openings in investing activities during also include proceeds of million from the sale of investments to fund this construction 
net cash used for investing activities was million during of which million was used to purchase investments from our initial public offering proceeds and million primarily relates to the funding for our two restaurants opened in during  net cash used in investing activities was million primarily reflecting the funding of three restaurants opened during that year and expenditures to acquire liquor licenses for those restaurants

net cash provided by financing activities was million during consisting primarily of million net proceeds from our initial public offering and million proceeds from equipment loans less million of related principal payments 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million during  which consisted primarily of the issuance of our convertible subordinated promissory note and proceeds from equipment loans  offset by payment of a promissory note and principal payments on equipment loans

 disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements in september  we sold the assets of saki s pacific rim caf 
we continue to be financially responsible for the lease payments in the event the purchaser defaults on the lease 
the lessor has obtained certain personal guarantees of the lease payments from the purchaser s owners should they fail to perform under the lease 
the total remaining lease payments due under the lease approximated  at december  the lease expired in january we did not fund any payments under this guarantee 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations during   or severe increases in inflation  however  could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and we select useful lives that reflect the actual economic lives of the underlying assets 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
we capitalize improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred 
we are often required to exercise judgment in our decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
we periodically perform asset impairment analysis of property and equipment related to our restaurant locations 
we perform these tests when we experience a triggering event such as a major change in a location s operating environment  or other event that might impact our ability to recover our asset investment 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
also  we have a policy of reviewing the financial operations of our restaurant locations on at least a quarterly basis 
locations that do not meet expectations are identified and monitored closely throughout the year 
primarily in the fourth quarter  we review actual results and analyze budgets for the ensuing year 
if we deem that a location s results will continue to be below expectations  we will analyze alternatives for its continued operation 
at that time  we will perform an asset impairment test 
if we determine that the asset s carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we will record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its fair value 
calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on our assumptions 
upon an event such as a formal decision for abandonment restaurant closure  we may record additional impairment charges 
any carryover basis of assets will be depreciated over the respective remaining useful lives 

table of contents leasing activities we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  we evaluate each property and classify the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we exercise significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the minimum future lease payments 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expensed during the rent holiday period 
we record contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales  which exceeds minimum base rent  over the periods the liability is incurred 
the contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
these estimates consider  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provisions 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets that are deemed more likely than not to be realized in the near term 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we establish valuation allowances to offset any deferred tax asset recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate  tax planning strategies  and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may be unable to implement certain tax planning strategies or adjust these estimates in future periods 
as we update our estimates  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations or financial position  or we could reduce our valuation allowances which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations or financial position 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards revised  share based payment sfas r 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not 
table of contents limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior 
the use of an option pricing model also requires the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends  and expected term 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of companies over the expected life of the option as we do not have enough history trading as a public company to calculate our own stock price volatility 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our expectation of future experience while considering our historical experience 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of earnings 
we are also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms 
the recoverability of such assets are dependent upon the actual deduction that may be available at exercise and can further be impaired by either the expiration of the option or an overall valuation reserve on deferred tax assets 
we believe the estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
impact of recently issued standards in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes and is effective for our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact that fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  that the implementation of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments we are exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in interest rates on our short term investments 
we held approximately million in available for sale securities as of december  a hypothetical basis point decline in the interest rate earned on our investments would decrease our interest income by approximately million 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of commodity costs  labor costs  and construction costs 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  and other factors outside our control 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks 
our labor costs may be impacted by proposed legislation to increase the minimum wage rate as many of our employees are paid labor rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
we have exposure to rising construction costs  which may impact our actual cost to develop new restaurants 
although the cost of restaurant construction will not impact significantly the operating results of the restaurant  it would impact the return on investment for such restaurant 

table of contents inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor  and construction costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years
