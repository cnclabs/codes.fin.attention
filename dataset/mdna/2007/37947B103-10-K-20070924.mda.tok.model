item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we provide traffic and news information reports to radio and television stations in international markets 
we are the largest provider of traffic information reports to radio and television stations in australia and canada 
we also provide news information reports to radio stations in canada and we believe that we maintain the largest inventory of commercial advertising embedded in radio news reports in australia 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale to advertisers of commercial advertising inventory associated with these information reports 
we obtain this advertising inventory from radio and television stations in exchange for information reports and or  for certain broadcasters  cash compensation 
although we are a delaware corporation with principal executive offices located in new york  new york  we do not provide  nor do we intend to provide traffic or news reports to radio or television stations in the united states 
on march   we consummated an initial public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
our australian operations are conducted by australia traffic network 
prior to our initial public offering  australia traffic network was a separate entity which was controlled by the same shareholder base that controlled us 
immediately prior to our initial public offering  we completed the share exchange  at which time australia traffic network became our wholly owned subsidiary 
the share exchange notes  which were intended to cover the estimated tax consequences to the shareholders of australia traffic network  were paid in their entirety on the closing date of the initial public offering out of the net proceeds from such offering 
on may   the underwriter for the offering closed on its over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares at the price to public less underwriting commissions and discounts 
the net proceeds from our initial public offering  including from the shares sold pursuant to the underwriter s over allotment option  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  was approximately million 
our canadian operations are conducted by canadian traffic network  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary 
on october   we formed uk traffic network to operate our business in the united kingdom 
although we have entered into contracts with several employees  we have not yet contracted with any radio or television stations to provide our services in the united kingdom 
global traffic network  inc is a holding company and conducts no operations 
unless we indicate otherwise  the discussions below regarding our financial condition and results of operations present information on a consolidated basis which assumes that the share exchange had been completed prior to the periods discussed such that australia traffic network was a wholly owned subsidiary of ours throughout such periods 
in that regard  our consolidated balance sheet data reflect the share exchange and discussions regarding our financial information reflect such information on a consolidated basis giving effect to the share exchange 
balance sheet information for periods prior to the share exchange does not reflect the issuance of the share exchange notes 
in each case  all material inter company transactions and balances have been eliminated 
financial information prior to may  the date of our formation pertains solely to australia traffic network 
on july  we consummated a follow on public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the net proceeds from the follow on offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  was approximately million 
the services we provide radio traffic reports  radio news reports and tv reports 
the information reports we provide to radio and television stations are divided into three categories based on the content of the report and the medium in which it is delivered 
collectively  we refer to these reports as our information reports 
radio traffic reports through our information gathering infrastructure and the use of external traffic information services  we provide daily scheduled customized traffic reports to radio stations that contract to receive our services 
radio news reports in july  we began building upon our radio traffic reports platform by obtaining and selling advertising inventory embedded within radio news reports 
tv reports in  we began providing regularly scheduled video traffic reports to television stations 
in addition  because our aircraft are often already in the air covering traffic conditions  they are often first to arrive at the scene of a breaking news story 
in a strategic effort to expand our reach into the television markets  we have been using this on the scene presence to compile video footage of such breaking news  which we provide to certain television stations that contract for our regularly scheduled tv reports in those markets where we produce video 

table of contents the radio stations that contract to receive our traffic and news reports become members of our radio network 
likewise  the television stations that contract to receive our tv reports become members of our tv network 
collectively  we refer to the members of these networks as our network affiliates 
we offer all three categories of information reports to our network affiliates in australia  but prior to our acquisition of substantially all the assets of wise broadcasting network inc  we only provided radio traffic reports and tv reports to our network affiliates in canada 
effective april   canadian traffic network acquired substantially all the assets of wise broadcasting network inc after which we commenced providing news  weather  sports and business information reports to certain of our canadian network affiliate radio stations on a limited basis 
as part of this acquisition  we started providing content and selling advertising for various digital signage outlets  but we do not expect this to be a material part of our future business 
separately  we have signed an agreement to provide tv reports to five television stations in five of our canadian markets 
we currently provide tv reports under this contract to three of the television stations and expect to commence providing tv reports to the remaining two stations shortly 
we intend to begin providing radio news reports and tv reports to our network affiliates in our remaining canadian markets as our canadian operations expand and opportunities present themselves 
our sources of revenue sale of commercial airtime inventory in exchange for providing our information reports and or  for certain broadcasters  cash compensation  our network affiliates provide us with commercial advertising inventory primarily comprised of ten second advertising spots embedded in information reports 
we generate revenues by packaging and selling this commercial advertising inventory for cash to advertisers on a local  regional or national network basis 
to date  we have recognized no revenue related to the bartering of goods and services and do not anticipate entering into barter transactions for the sale of our commercial advertising inventory in the future 
the substantial majority of our revenues have been generated from our australian operations  including approximately million  or  of our revenues for year ended june  of such amount  approximately million  or  has been generated from the sale of commercial advertising inventory related to our australian radio traffic reports 
we expect to accumulate increasing amounts of commercial advertising inventory from our australian operations as we continue to expand the provision of radio news reports and tv reports in australia 
we began accumulating commercial advertising inventory from our canadian operations in december and began generating limited revenue in canada in january currently  we have operations in seven canadian cities calgary  toronto  hamilton  vancouver  montreal  edmonton and winnipeg 
as commercial advertising inventory generated from our new canadian operations and our expanded australian operations increases  we expect to sell the increased commercial advertising inventory in the same manner as we have sold commercial advertising inventory generated from our provision of radio traffic reports in australia 
our experience indicates  however  that there is generally a delay between acquiring commercial advertising inventory from new or expanded operations and the realization of increasing revenue from the sale of such inventory 
we experienced such a delay when we added austereo as a network affiliate of our radio network in fiscal year although the additional commercial advertising inventory we acquired from austereo led to increased revenues during fiscal year  the full impact on revenues from the sale of such inventory was not realized until fiscal year we expect to experience similar delays in realizing revenues from the sale of commercial advertising inventory attributable to radio news reports and tv reports in australia and our provision of radio traffic and information reports and tv reports in canada 
our expenses our expenses are primarily comprised of three categories operating expenses  selling expenses and general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses consist of station compensation and all expenses related to the gathering  producing  and broadcasting of our information reports  including aviation costs and expenses  salaries and benefits for our on air personalities who deliver the information reports 
station compensation consists of the reimbursement of expenses incurred by stations which we would otherwise incur in providing services to the station  as well as any additional cash consideration paid to a network affiliate in exchange for commercial advertising inventory 
we may incur increased expenses in the form of station compensation in connection with adding certain broadcasters to our base of network affiliates 
as mentioned above  our experience indicates that in such instances there is generally a delay between acquiring commercial advertising inventory from new network affiliates and the realization of increased revenue from the sale of such inventory 
aviation costs relate to the costs of our airborne surveillance  an integral part of our information gathering  and consist both of payments to outside vendors to lease aircraft and the operating costs including fuel  maintenance  and insurance costs associated with the operation of the fleet of aircraft we own 
our fleet of leased and owned aircraft currently consists of 
table of contents australia canada leased owned leased owned fixed wing aircraft helicopters in august  we took delivery of a helicopter that replaced an owned helicopter in canada that was destroyed during a maintenance flight accident see footnotes to our audited financial statements 
as our canadian operations expand  we intend to purchase two additional helicopters to replace our two leased helicopters in canada 
until we are able to purchase the number of helicopters necessary to support our operations  we intend to continue to lease such helicopters 
in september  we placed a  deposit to order another helicopter 
the purchase price is approximately to million 
we can cancel the order by forfeiting the deposit 
selling expenses include salaries and benefits for our sales personnel and commissions paid on sales of our commercial advertising inventory 
general and administrative expenses consists of corporate overhead  including administrative salaries  real property lease payments  insurance  salaries and benefits for our corporate executive officers  compensation expense related to stock options and legal and accounting fees 
expenses other than selling expenses are generally accounted for evenly over the applicable fiscal year 
basis of presentation we derive substantially all of our income and revenue to date from our australian operations and  to a lesser extent  our canadian operations and we have recently begun generating expenses from our attempt to expand our operations into the united kingdom

this industry trend is mainly attributable to increases in the level of advertiser demand  and resulting increases in average advertising spot rates and or number of spots sold  during the months leading up to the christmas holiday season and lower advertiser demand following the end of the holiday season which leads to lower average advertising spot rates and or number of spots sold during that time 
we believe that this general trend in advertising revenues is applicable to our business 
our expenses other than sales costs are generally spread evenly over the fiscal year 
as a result  we generally experience seasonality in the amount of our net income absent growth due to the addition of new network affiliates 
results of operations year ended june  compared with year ended june  during the year ended june   we commenced in australia providing radio news advertising inventory for our advertising clients and expanded our tv services 
in addition  we commenced providing radio traffic services in canada  commencing broadcasting traffic reports in our first market in december and initially broadcasting in our seventh market in april we also became a public company in march  which increased our corporate overhead costs 
during the year ended june   our results were impacted by the full year of costs associated with the introduction of traffic services to canada and a full year of costs of being a public company  as well as additional expenses associated with further expansion of our news offerings in australia 
in addition  we began to incur expenses in the united kingdom in anticipation of commencing operations there in the future 
as of the date of this report  we had not contracted with any radio or television stations in the united kingdom to provide our services or to receive advertising inventory 
revenue 
revenue increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june   an increase of approximately 
the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a million increase in revenues from our australian operations 
additionally  revenues from the sale of inventory related to our canadian operations increased approximately million to approximately million from million in the previous year 
the increase in our australian revenues consisted of approximately million from our radio network and approximately million from our tv network 
the increase in revenues from our radio network was approximately million from our traffic network and approximately million from our news network 
we generated no revenue from the united kingdom for the years ended june  and operating expenses 
operating expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june   an increase of approximately 
approximately million of the increase pertained to our operations in canada 
during the year ended june   our first canadian market began broadcasting traffic reports in mid december  five of our markets commenced broadcasting traffic reports during the three months ended march  and our seventh market commenced broadcasting traffic reports in april for the year ended june   we broadcast traffic reports in all seven markets for the entire year 
approximately million of the increase in operating expenses pertained to our australian operations 
of the increase in australian operating expenses  approximately million pertained to our traffic operations  approximately million to our news operations and approximately million to our tv operations 
the increase in traffic operating expenses consisted primarily of approximately million in station compensation and approximately million of employee costs  partially offset by approximately million reduction in aviation costs 
the increase in news operating expenses consisted primarily of approximately million related to hiring a news director  approximately increase in production costs  and approximately million increase in station compensation due primarily to additional news affiliates  as well as contractual increases to previously existing affiliates 
as of june  we had ten radio 
table of contents news affiliates and we had radio news affiliates as of june  approximately million of the increase in operating expenses pertained to the united kingdom  mainly the cost of personnel hired to obtain radio station affiliates and set up operations 
if we are successful in procuring radio and television affiliates in the united kingdom  we will incur significant additional costs 
such costs can not be reasonably estimated unless and until such agreements are negotiated 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june   an increase of approximately 
approximately million of the increase pertained to corporate overhead  including costs associated with the expansion of our corporate staff as a result of hiring a senior vice president director of international sales  non cash compensation expense relating to our granting of stock options and costs related to our status as a public company incurred during the year ended june  because we became a public reporting company on march   the impact on costs of being a public company did not impact the entire year ending june  likewise  we did not begin to grant stock options until after our initial public offering  so the non cash compensation expenses resulting from stock option grants was also limited during the year ended june  expense from the granting of employee  contractor and director stock options was approximately million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  effective july   we began to allocate our corporate overhead expense to our australian operating company 
it has been determined that it is not necessary to allocate overhead to our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries due to the start up nature of the operations 
we had allocated approximately million of overhead to our canadian subsidiary during the interim periods in fiscal before making the determination 
this allocation and subsequent reversal has no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the amount allocated for the year ended june  was approximately million to australia traffic network 
the net impact to australia traffic network as a result of this allocation  after factoring in the approximately million management fee charged to australia traffic network by wisconsin information systems  inc d b a milwaukee traffic network milwaukee traffic network for the year ended june   was an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million 
following our initial public offering  we ceased paying management fees to milwaukee traffic network at the end of march in addition to the approximately million increase in overhead  australia traffic network selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million due to increased sales personnel costs primarily associated with the increased sales during the year 
sales expense as a percentage of revenue in australia decreased from approximately for the year ended june  to approximately for the year ended june  canadian traffic network selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million 
as previously discussed  we commenced operations in the majority of our markets in the latter half of the year ended june  and the majority of the increase pertains to having had operations in canada for the entire year ended june  selling  general and administrative expenses related to our expansion into the united kingdom was approximately million for the year ended june   which primarily consisted of legal and travel expenses 
if we are successful in procuring radio and television station contracts in the united kingdom  our united kingdom operations will incur significantly higher costs than were incurred in the year ended june  depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the increase is mainly due to our acquisition of additional helicopters throughout the year ended june   as well as helicopters placed in service during the year ended june  that were not depreciated for the entire year 
we have taken delivery of an additional helicopter for use in our canadian operations and plan to purchase two additional helicopters for use in our canadian operations 
consequently we expect that depreciation and amortization expense will continue to increase accordingly in future periods 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million of the year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the canadian traffic network shareholder note and australia traffic network bank overdraft line of credit during the current year 
other income 
other income increased from approximately increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to interest income on the unused portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering 
in addition  we recognized a gain during the year ended june  on disposal of the helicopter that was destroyed in a crash of approximately  until we utilize the net proceeds of the follow on offering of our common stock that closed on july   we expect other income to be higher in future periods due to the interest income generated on the cash balances 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the increase in net profit before taxes in australia for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the effective tax rate in australia was and for the years ended june  and respectively  compared with the australia statutory federal rate of 
the difference from the statutory rate for the year ended june  was primarily due to minor non deductible expenses having disproportionate impact due to the small net profit for the period

net loss 
net loss decreased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  net income for australia traffic network increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june   despite approximately million increase in overhead expenses primarily resulting from our allocation of corporate overhead expenses that commenced on july  net loss for canadian traffic network increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the increase in canadian traffic network net loss was primarily due to the increased costs of operating for the entire year ended june 
table of contents   which was not entirely offset by the increase in revenues

the united states shareholders of australia traffic network recorded their share of australia traffic network s income on their personal income tax returns and received deduction on their united states federal income tax returns for the australian taxes paid 
because australian income taxes are generally lower than united states income taxes  a tax liability was passed on to each united states shareholder 
australia traffic network s then existing shareholders became liable for the tax triggered by the share exchange 
prior to the effective time of the initial public offering  we issued the share exchange notes  in an aggregate amount of million  to the australia traffic network shareholders 
the share exchange notes were intended to cover the estimated tax consequences to such shareholders of the share exchange 
upon the closing of the initial public offering  we repaid the share exchange notes in full 
we operate as a united states corporation with wholly owned direct and indirect operating subsidiaries in australia  canada and united kingdom 
we will pay income taxes in those countries as well as in the united states 
the current federal statutory tax rate is in australia while the estimated effective combined federal and provincial tax rate is approximately in canada  the estimated effective corporate tax rate in the united kingdom is approximately and the estimated federal and state tax rate in the united states is approximately 
contractual commitments the table below sets forth our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations including shareholder note interest on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations station obligations total critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition 
table of contents revenue recognition 
revenues are earned and recognized at the time commercial advertisements are broadcast 
payments received in advance or amounts invoiced in advance are deferred until earned and such payments and amounts are included as a component of deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
all revenues pertain to cash sales 
we determine that commercial advertisements are broadcast based on the announcers written verification on the broadcast log 
the broadcast log is a schedule of station  time and advertiser for each report that an announcer broadcasts 
the broadcast logs are generated by our scheduling department through our automated scheduling system  based on advertising sales orders and our network affiliate stations scheduled report times 
revenues are reported net of commissions given to third party advertising agencies that represent a majority of the advertisers 
cash and cash equivalents 
we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents 
the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and are not interest bearing 
we perform credit evaluations of our new advertisers and generally require no collateral 
we provide for losses from uncollectible accounts based on analyzing historical data and current trends 
such losses have historically been minimal in relation to revenues 
past due amounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is deemed unlikely and all collection efforts have ceased 
management has established an allowance of approximately   and as of june   and  respectively 
income taxes 
we have adopted the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under the asset and liability method of sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to net operating loss carry forwards and to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas  the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized in the statement of income in the period that included the enactment 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets unless their realization is considered more likely than not 
currently  of the us  united kingdom and canadian tax loss carry forwards generated by us are allowed for since it is unclear whether we will ever have us income  to utilize the tax loss carry forwards and foreign tax credits and it is not yet reasonably certain that our operations in canada or the united kingdom will be profitable in the future to utilize these tax loss carry forwards 
undistributed earnings of the our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested so no provision for united states federal or state taxes has been made 
upon repatriation of these earnings  via dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to united states federal and state income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits 
we may also be subject to withholding taxes on any distribution in the foreign countries 
the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is an interpretation of sfas fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step is recognition  in which the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the merits of the position 
the second step is measurement in which a tax position which meets the more likely than not threshold of the first step is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted fin effective as of july  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires that public companies utilize a dual approach to assessing the quantitative effects of financial misstatements 
this dual approach includes both an income statement focused assessment and a balance sheet focused assessment 
the guidance in sab must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  we adopted sab effective as of july  and its adoption has had no material impact on our financial statements 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to us gaap guidance requiring use of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements

table of contents adopt sfas effective as of july  we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas  but do not expect that it will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and long term debt 
we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
however  due to the large cash and cash equivalents balances  a one percent decrease in the interest rates we earn on these balances would reduce interest income approximately  on an annual basis based on the balances at june  we have no derivative financial instruments in our cash and cash equivalents 
our total outstanding long term debt as june  was approximately million 
of the outstanding long term debt  only approximately million consists of a variable interest rate while the remainder was subject to a fixed interest rate 
in addition  we had an expired unutilized bank overdraft line of credit of approximately million that bears interest at a variable rate that has been subsequently been extended until may  we do not see the variable interest rate long term debt as a significant interest rate risk 
assuming our level of borrowings including the bank overdraft line of credit as of june   a one percentage point increase in interest rates under these borrowings would have increased our interest expense approximately  annually 
foreign currency exchange risk we have significant foreign subsidiaries located in australia  canada and the united kingdom 
the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars and british pounds  respectively  and as such are translated into united states dollars 
income statement amounts are translated from australian dollars  canadian dollars  or british pounds to united states dollars based on the average exchange rate for each quarterly period covered 
assets and liabilities are converted based on the exchange rate as of the applicable balance sheet date 
foreign currency translation adjustments occur when the income statement and balance sheet are converted at different exchange rates and are recognized as other comprehensive income or loss in the financial statements 
we do not currently hedge for currency fluctuations with our foreign subsidiaries 
accounts receivable the company s receivables do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the large number of customers and the fact that no one customer represents more than of our annual revenue 
however  one advertising agency that represents a number of our clients constituted approximately of our revenues for the year ended june  and approximately of our net accounts receivable as of june  off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements
