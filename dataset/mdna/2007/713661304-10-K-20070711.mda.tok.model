item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is included to describe the company s financial position and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended april  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of clinical stage and pre clinical product candidates using monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and viral diseases 
we are advancing three separate clinical programs encompassing two platform technologies anti phosphatidylserine anti ps immunotherapeutics and tumor necrosis therapy tnt 
our lead anti ps product  bavituximab  is in separate phase i clinical trials for the treatment of solid cancers and hepatitis c virus hcv infection 
under our tnt technology platform  our lead candidate cotara  is advancing through two brain cancer clinical studies including a phase ii clinical trial in which up to patients with glioblastoma multiforme will be treated in order to better evaluate efficacy of cotara and a dose confirmation and dosimetry clinical trial in up to patients with glioblastoma multiforme in order to further characterize the distribution characteristics of cotara 
we are organized into two reportable operating segments i peregrine  the parent company  is engaged in the research and development of monoclonal antibody based therapeutics and ii avid bioservices  inc  avid a wholly owned subsidiary  is engaged in providing bio manufacturing services for peregrine and outside customers on a fee for services basis 
results of operations the following table compares the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and this table provides you with an overview of the changes in the statement of operations for the comparative periods  which changes are further discussed below 
years ended april  years ended april  change change in thousands in thousands revenues contract manufacturing license revenue total revenues cost and expenses cost of contract manufacturing research and development selling  general and administrative total cost and expenses loss from operations other income expense recovery of note receivable interest and other income interest and other expense net loss total revenues year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in revenues of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was due to an increase in contract manufacturing revenue of  combined with an increase in license revenue of  the increase in contract manufacturing revenue was primarily due to the increase in services provided to unrelated entities on a fee for service basis combined with the collection of disputed services in the amount of  during the current year associated with manufacturing services performed during the year ended april  since collectibility of the receivable was not reasonably assured  in accordance with sab no 
 we did not recognize revenue in prior years and the related work in process inventory was written off and included in cost of contract manufacturing during the year ended april  we expect to continue to generate contract manufacturing revenue during fiscal year based on the anticipated completion of in process customer related projects and the anticipated demand for avid s services under outstanding proposals 
avid is presently working on several active projects for existing clients and has submitted project proposals to various potential clients 
since the timing to initiate and complete projects for existing clients and our ability to convert outstanding proposals into new contracts and new business is at the discretion of our clients or potential clients  we cannot reasonably estimate with a high degree of likelihood our revenues for fiscal year year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in revenues of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to a decrease in contract manufacturing revenue of  combined with a decrease in license revenue of  the decrease in contract manufacturing revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of completed manufacturing runs associated with unrelated entities compared to fiscal year during which time we significantly increased our utilization of our manufacturing facility to manufacture clinical grade materials to support peregrine s three active clinical trials and other products under development 
cost of contract manufacturing year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenues improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year in the prior year  we reported an in increase in cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the write off of unusable work in process inventory generated for an unrelated entity combined with an estimated contract loss provision for the same entity during the prior year 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in cost of contract manufacturing of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily related to the fiscal year decrease in contract manufacturing revenue 
the fiscal year decrease was offset by the write off of unusable work in process inventory generated for an unrelated entity during the quarter ended april  combined with an estimated contract loss provision for the same unrelated entity  which amount in the aggregate totaled  research and development expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform anti ps immunotherapeutics bavituximab tnt cotara vta and anti angiogenesis agents vea total r d expenses o anti phosphatidylserine anti ps immunotherapeutics bavituximab the increase in anti ps immunotherapeutics program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily from continuing efforts to support the development and clinical development of our first anti ps immunotherapeutics agent  bavituximab 
during the current fiscal year  clinical trial expenses increased as we advanced the development of two separate phase i clinical programs using bavituximab for the treatment of advanced solid cancers and chronic hepatitis c virus infection hcv  including the initiation and completion of a phase ib study in india during the current fiscal year using bavituximab for the treatment of advanced solid cancers in combination with chemotherapy 
these increases in clinical trial expenses were further supplemented with increases in payroll and related expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  and non cash expenses associated with shares of common stock earned by employees under our february stock bonus plan 
these amounts were offset by a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expenses associated with non employee consultants 
these increases in anti ps immunotherapeutics program expenses were further offset by decreases in i manufacturing expenses incurred in the prior year regarding manufacturing commercial scale up efforts to support our clinical trials  ii outside antibody development fees related to a humanized antibody in development  and iii technology access fees primarily associated with clinical milestones achieved during the prior year in accordance with third party licensing agreements 
o tumor necrosis therapy tnt cotara the increase in tnt program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased clinical trial expenses to support the cotara dose confirmation and dosimetry clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gbm and the initiation of a phase ii clinical trial in india in patients with gbm at first relapse 
these increases in clinical trial expenses were further supplemented with increases in payroll and related expenses to support our cotara clinical studies and in house tnt research and development efforts combined with an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense primarily associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  o vascular targeting agents vtas and anti angiogenesis agents the increase in vta and anti angiogenesis agents program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses  manufacturing expenses and outside research studies associated with increased efforts to advance the pre clinical development of our vta and anti angiogenesis agents programs 
these increases were further supplemented by an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense primarily associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  o vasopermeation enhancements agents veas the increase in vea program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses  laboratory materials and outside antibody development studies associated with increased efforts to advance the pre clinical development of our vea program 
these increases were further supplemented by an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense primarily associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  the above vea increases were offset with a decrease in technology license fees incurred in the prior year associated with an annual license fee due under a former license agreement 
we expect research and development expenses to increase over the near term primarily under the following ongoing research and development programs ongoing and anticipated bavituximab clinical studies for the treatment of solid tumors and chronic hepatitis c virus infection  cotara clinical studies for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme in two separate clinical studies  anti ps immunotherapeutics research and development program  c anti angiogenesis antibody research and development program  vascular targeting agent research and development program  and vasopermeation enhancement agent research and development program 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to a net increase in expenses associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform anti ps immunotherapeutics bavituximab tnt cotara vta and anti angiogenesis agents vea other research programs total r d expenses o anti phosphatidylserine anti ps immunotherapeutics bavituximab the increase in anti ps immunotherapeutics program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from the advancement of our first anti ps immunotherapeutic agent  bavituximab 
during fiscal year  we increased manufacturing  in house antibody development  and clinical trials expenses of bavituximab as we supported the manufacturing commercial scale up efforts and clinical trial expenses to support two separate phase i clinical studies using bavituximab for the treatment of advanced solid cancers and chronic hepatitis c virus infection 
the foregoing expenses were supplemented with an increase in technology access fees associated with clinical trial milestones achieved during the fiscal year in accordance with third party licensing agreements  an increase in sponsored research fees  and an increase in outside animal research studies to support the possible expansion of bavituximab clinical trials in other anti viral indications 
these increases were primarily offset by a decrease in pre clinical toxicology study expenses incurred in fiscal year to support the bavituximab investigational new drug ind applications that were filed in fiscal year combined with a decrease in intellectual property access fees and a decrease in outside antibody development fees related to our humanized antibody in development 
o tumor necrosis therapy tnt cotara the decrease in tnt program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses and radiolabeling process development expenses incurred in fiscal year to support the initiation of the cotara dose confirmation and dosimetry clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent gbm and to support other development programs associated with our tnt technology platform 
these decreases were further supplemented by a decrease in technology access fees incurred in fiscal year supporting the production of monoclonal antibodies for cotara 
o vascular targeting agents vtas and anti angiogenesis agents the decrease in vta and anti angiogenesis agents program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in intellectual property access fees and sponsored research fees as our outside researchers were focused on the development of our anti ps immunotherapeutics technology platform 
o vasopermeation enhancements agents veas the decrease in vea program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in sponsored research fees and technology license fees combined with a decrease in antibody development fees regarding expenses incurred in fiscal year in january  we entered into an agreement with merck kgaa of darmstadt  germany  that gave us access to merck s technology and expertise in protein expression to advance the development of our vea technology and other platform technologies 
we are currently developing a clinical candidate under our vea technology utilizing merck s expertise in protein expression 
looking beyond the next twelve months  it is extremely difficult for us to reasonably estimate all future research and development costs associated with each of our technologies due to the number of unknowns and uncertainties associated with pre clinical and clinical trial development 
these unknown variables and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the uncertainty of our capital resources to fund research  development and clinical studies beyond fiscal year  the uncertainty of future costs associated with our pre clinical candidates  including vascular targeting agents  anti angiogenesis agents  and vasopermeation enhancement agents  which costs are dependent on the success of pre clinical development 
we are uncertain whether or not these product candidates will be successful and we are uncertain whether or not we will incur any additional costs beyond pre clinical development  the uncertainty of future clinical trial results  the uncertainty of the ultimate number of patients to be treated in any current or future clinical trial  the uncertainty of the food and drug administration allowing our studies to move forward from phase i clinical studies to phase ii and phase iii clinical studies  the uncertainty of the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future study 
any delays in clinical trials could significantly increase the cost of the study and would extend the estimated completion dates  the uncertainty of terms related to potential future partnering or licensing arrangements  and the uncertainty of protocol changes and modifications in the design of our clinical trial studies  which may increase or decrease our future costs 
we or our potential partners will need to do additional development and clinical testing prior to seeking any regulatory approval for commercialization of our product candidates as all of our products are in discovery  pre clinical or clinical development 
testing  manufacturing  commercialization  advertising  promotion  exporting and marketing  among other things  of our proposed products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and we cannot guarantee that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in conducting advanced human clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
furthermore  the united states food and drug administration may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
accordingly  we or our potential partners may experience difficulties and delays in obtaining necessary governmental clearances and approvals to market our products  and we or our potential partners may not be able to obtain all necessary governmental clearances and approvals to market our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses  director fees  legal and accounting fees  stock based compensation expense  investor and public relation fees  insurance  and other expenses relating to the general management  administration  and business development activities of the company 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to decreases in corporate legal fees  investor and public relation fees  and payroll and related expenses 
corporate legal fees decreased  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily due to corporate legal fees incurred in the prior year associated with a legal settlement related to certain technology agreements with a university that was reached in march investor and public relation fees decreased  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily due to consolidating the outsourcing of our investor and public relation activities 
payroll and related expenses remained in line with the prior year and decreased slightly from  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year these decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses were offset with an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year due to the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  and the issuance of non cash stock bonuses during the current year associated with the achievement of pre determined milestones as set forth in the company s february stock bonus plan  which were offset by a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expenses associated with non employee consultants 
in addition  we incurred incremental increases in other general corporate related expenses primarily associated with facility related expenses and directors and officers insurance fees 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses of  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in headcount across most corporate functions to support our increased operations  which were offset by a decrease in consulting fees associated with the prior year business development efforts of the company 
during fiscal year  we hired a vice president of business development whose responsibilities include those previously performed by outside consultants 
the fiscal year increase is also due to an increase in i stock based compensation expense of  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year associated with the amortization of the fair value of options and warrants provided to non employee consultants for business development and general corporate services  ii investor and public relation fees of  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily due to services provided by public relation firms assisting the company with its investor and public relations activities  whose services were not utilized in fiscal year  iii travel and related expenses of  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily associated with our participation in several investor conferences and non deal marketing road shows during fiscal year combined with an increase in travel associated with business development and other corporate activities  and iv board of director fees of  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in the number of non employee directors combined with an increase in the number of company board meetings 
these increases were supplemented with increases in other general corporate matters primarily associated with an incremental increase in corporate legal fees and facility expenses combined with fees associated with the adoption of the company s stockholder rights agreement in march recovery of note receivable year ended april  compared to the year ended april  and april  during fiscal year  we recovered a previously fully reserved note receivable in the amount of  which amount did not repeat in either fiscal year and fiscal year as further discussed in note  recovery of note receivable to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other income of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is due to a  increase in interest income as a result of a higher average cash balance on hand and higher prevailing interest rates during the current year compared to the prior year offset with a net decrease in other income of  the net decrease in other income is primarily due to  of other income recorded during the prior year in connection with a legal settlement related to certain technology agreements with a university  which amount was offset by the sale of a trademark name during the current year in the amount of  year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other income of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is due to a  increase in interest income as a result of a higher average cash balance on hand and higher prevailing interest rates during the current year compared to the prior year combined with a  increase in other income  which is primarily due to  of other income recorded during the quarter ended april  in connection with a legal settlement related to certain technology agreements with a university 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenues we recognize revenues pursuant to the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition 
in accordance with sab no 
 revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we comply with financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with eitf  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
revenues associated with licensing agreements primarily consist of nonrefundable up front license fees and milestone payments 
revenues under licensing agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the agreement 
nonrefundable up front license fees received under license agreements  whereby continued performance or future obligation are considered inconsequential to the relevant licensed technology  are generally recognized as revenue upon delivery of the technology 
nonrefundable up front license fees  whereby we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligations  are generally recorded as deferred revenue and generally recognized as revenue over the term of the performance obligation or relevant agreement 
milestone payments are generally recognized as revenue upon completion of the milestone assuming there are no other continuing obligations 
under some license agreements  the obligation period may not be contractually defined 
under these circumstances  we must exercise judgment in estimating the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided to enable the licensee to practice the license 
contract manufacturing revenues are generally recognized once the service has been provided and or upon shipment of the product to the customer 
we also record a provision for estimated contract losses  if any  in the period in which they are determined 
in july  the emerging issues task force eitf released issue eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
eitf summarized the eitf s views on when revenue should be recorded at the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services  or the net amount retained the amount billed to the customer less the amount paid to a supplier because it has earned a fee or commission 
in addition  the eitf released issue eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  and issue eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
eitf summarized the eitf s views on how the seller of goods should classify in the income statement amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling and the costs associated with shipping and handling 
eitf summarized the eitf s views on when the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses should be characterized as revenue or as a reduction of expenses incurred 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with eitf  eitf and eitf whereby we record revenue for the gross amount billed to customers the cost of raw materials  supplies and shipping  plus the related handling mark up fee and we record the cost of the amounts billed as cost of sales as we act as a principal in these transactions 
stock based compensation expense prior to may   we accounted for our equity compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized in our financial statements related to stock option grants  as all options granted under our equity compensation plans had an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date 
effective may   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  stock based compensation cost recognized beginning may  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or subsequent to may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model and are amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period typically years 
use of a valuation model requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility is based on daily historical volatility of our stock covering the estimated expected term 
the expected term of options granted is based on the expected time to exercise using the simplified method allowable under the security and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury notes with terms within the contractual life of the option at the time of grant 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
our loss from operations for the fiscal year april  included stock based compensation expense of  as of april   the total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options was  which amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continually monitor our allowance for doubtful accounts for all receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables and we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on these factors at that point in time 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents compared to  at april  on june   we raised an additional  in net proceeds under a securities purchase agreement with several institutional investors 
as of june   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds received under the june  securities purchase agreement 
although we have sufficient cash on hand to meet our planned obligations through at least fiscal year based on our current projections  our development efforts are highly dependent on our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations 
we have expended substantial funds on the development of our product candidates and we have incurred negative cash flows from operations for the majority of our years since inception 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our common stock and issuance of convertible debt  which has been supplemented with payments received from various licensing collaborations and through the revenues generated by avid 
we expect negative cash flows from operations to continue until we are able to generate sufficient revenue from the contract manufacturing services provided by avid and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development 
revenues earned by avid during fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
we expect that avid will continue to generate revenues which should partially offset our consolidated cash flows used in operations  although we expect those near term revenues will be insufficient to cover total anticipated cash flows used in operations 
in addition  revenues from the sale and or licensing of our products under development are always uncertain 
therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations beyond fiscal year we may raise additional capital through the sale of shares of our common stock  which as of june   we have approximately  shares available for possible future registered transactions under two separate registration statements 
in addition  during january  we filed a separate registration statement on form s  file number  which allows us to issue  from time to time  in one or more offerings  shares of our common stock for remaining proceeds of up to  however  given uncertain market conditions and the volatility of our stock price and trading volume  we may not be able to sell our securities at prices or on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
in addition to equity financing  we actively explore various other sources of funding  including possible debt financing and leveraging our many assets  including our intellectual property portfolio 
our broad intellectual property portfolio allows us to develop products internally while at the same time we are able to out license certain areas of the technology which would not interfere with our internal product development efforts 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that sufficient additional revenues will be generated from avid or under potential licensing agreements to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates beyond fiscal year significant components of the changes in cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the year ended april  compared to the prior year are as follows cash used in operating activities 
cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by changes in our net loss 
however  cash used in operating activities generally differs from our reported net loss as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during the year ended april   cash used in operating activities increased  to  compared to  for the year ended april  the increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily related to an increase of  in net cash used in operating activities before considering changes in operating assets and liabilities 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development expenses offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and an increase in contract manufacturing revenue 
this increase in cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was offset by a net change in operating assets and payment or reduction of liabilities in the aggregate amount of the changes in operating activities as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities are as follows year ended april  net loss  as reported less non cash operating expenses depreciation and amortization stock based compensation and common stock issued under stock bonus plan amortization of expenses paid in shares of common stock loss gain on sale of property recovery of note receivable net cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities net change in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities amount to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  during the same prior year period 
this decrease in net cash provided by investing activities of  was primarily due to the recovery of a note receivable in the amount of  during the prior year offset by a current year decrease of  in property acquisitions and a  decrease in other assets primarily related to security deposits paid in the prior year to ge capital corporation on notes payable and prior year installment payments made on certain laboratory equipment 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased  to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash provided of  for the same prior year period 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was primarily due to proceeds received under a security purchase agreement whereby we sold and issued a total of  shares of our common stock in exchange for aggregate net proceeds of  which was supplemented with net proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was primarily due to net proceeds received from the sale of our common stock under various security purchase agreements in the amount of  supplemented with net proceeds of  from this exercise of stock options and warrants and  received from the financing of laboratory equipment with ge capital corporation 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of april   aggregated by type payments due by period in thousands total year years years after years operating leases  net notes payable capital lease obligation other long term liabilities minimum license obligations total contractual obligations represents our i facility operating lease in tustin  california under a non cancelable lease agreement  ii facility operating lease in houston  texas  which has an original three year lease term  and iii various office equipment leases  which generally have five year lease terms 
represents our note payable agreements entered into with general electric capital corporation during fiscal years and to finance laboratory equipment 
amounts include principal and interest 
represents our capital lease agreement to finance certain office equipment 
amounts include principal and interest 
represents licensing agreements we periodically enter into with third parties to obtain exclusive or non exclusive licenses for certain technologies 
the terms of certain of these agreements require us to pay future milestone payments based on product development success 
we anticipate we may make milestone payments in the amount of  during fiscal year under in licensing agreements pertaining to our bavituximab clinical trials 
other milestones fees under these and other licensing agreements cannot be predicted due to the uncertainty of future clinical trial results and development milestones and therefore  cannot be reasonably predicted or estimated at the present time
