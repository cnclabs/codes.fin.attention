the company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above could affect the company s financial performance and could cause the company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements 
the company does not undertake  and specifically declines any obligation  to publicly release the results of any revisions  which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
the company s business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank dedicated to providing value added products and services to our customers 
generally  the company has sought to implement this strategy by emphasizing retail deposits as its primary source of funds and maintaining a substantial part of its assets in locally originated residential first mortgage loans  loans to business enterprises operating in its markets  and in investment securities 
specifically  the company s business strategy incorporates the following elements i operating as an independent community oriented financial institution  ii maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  iii emphasizing investment in one to four family residential mortgage loans  loans to small businesses and investment securities  and iv maintaining a strong retail deposit base 
the company s net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its investments in mortgage and other loans  investment securities and other assets  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings 
the company s net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as by the amount of noninterest income  including income from fees  service charges and servicing rights  net gains and losses on sales of securities  loans and foreclosed real estate  and noninterest expense such as employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  data processing costs and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  which events are beyond the control of the company 
in particular  the general level of market rates tends to be highly cyclical 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective and complex judgments  and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses  and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in this report 
the company carries all of its security investments at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax as an adjustment to shareholders equity 
based on management s assessment  at december   the company did not hold any security that had a fair value decline that is currently expected to be other than temporary 
consequently  any declines in a specific security s fair value below amortized cost have not been provided for in the consolidated income statement 
the company s ability to fully realize the value of its investment in various securities  including corporate debt securities  is dependent on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing organization

this flattening of the market yield curve has had a negative impact on the company s interest rate spread and net interest margin to date 
if short term interest rates continue to rise  and if rates on deposits and borrowings continue to reprice upwards faster than the rates on longer term loans and investments  the bank will continue to experience compression of its net interest rate spread and net interest margin  which would result in a negative impact on the company s profitability

the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory and the loan is past due days or more 
the company considers a loan impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on fair value of the collateral

management has identified potential credit problems which may result in the borrower not being able to comply with the current loan repayment terms and which may result in it being included in subsequent past due reporting 
management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable credit losses in the current loan portfolio 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to expense in the form of a provision for loan losses and reduced by loan charge offs net of recoveries 
allowance for loan losses represents the amount available for probable credit losses in the company s loan portfolio as estimated by management 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon a monthly evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  which includes a review of the balances and composition of the loan portfolio as well as analyzing the level of delinquencies in each segment of the loan portfolio 
the company uses a general allocation method for the residential real estate and the consumer loan pools based upon a methodology that uses loss factors applied to loan balances and reflects actual loss experience  delinquency trends and current economic conditions 
the company reviews individually  commercial real estate and commercial loans greater than  that are not accruing interest and risk rated under the company s risk rating system  as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss to determine if the loans are impaired 
if loans are determined to be impaired  the company establishes a specific reserve allocation 
the specific allocation is determined based on the most recent valuation of the loan s collateral and the customer s ability to pay 
for all other commercial real estate and commercial loans  the company uses the general allocation method that establishes a reserve for each risk rating category 
the general allocation method for commercial real estate and commercial loans considers the same factors that are considered when evaluating residential real estate and consumer loan pools 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses at december  the allowance for loan losses was million at december   an decrease from december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to at december  from in the prior year 
net loan charge offs were  during compared to  in the majority of the current year charge off activity is the result of the write down of portions of two commercial lending relationships

capital adequacy is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios which measure capital against total assets  as well as against total assets that are weighted based on defined risk characteristics 
the company s goal is to maintain a strong capital position  consistent with the risk profile of its subsidiary banks that supports growth and expansion activities while at the same time exceeding regulatory standards 
at december   pathfinder bank exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios and met the regulatory definition of a well capitalized institution  ie a leverage capital ratio exceeding  a tier risk based capital ratio exceeding and a total risk based capital ratio exceeding

liquidity liquidity management involves the company s ability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to support asset growth  meet deposit withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  and otherwise operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowed funds  amortization and prepayment of loans and maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the company manages the pricing of deposits to maintain a desired deposit balance 
in addition  the company invests excess funds in short term interest earning and other assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
the company s liquidity has been enhanced by its membership in the fhlbny  whose competitive advance programs and lines of credit provide the company with a safe  reliable and convenient source of funds 
a significant decrease in deposits in the future could result in the company having to seek other sources of funds for liquidity purposes 
such sources could include  but are not limited to  additional borrowings  trust preferred security offerings  brokered deposits  negotiated time deposits  the sale of available for sale investment securities  the sale of securitized loans  or the sale of whole loans 
such actions could result in higher interest expense costs and or losses on the sale of securities or loans

in addition  the company  in the conduct of ordinary business operations  routinely enters into contracts for services 
these contracts may require payment for services to be provided in the future and may also contain penalty clauses for the early termination of the contract 
management is not aware of any additional commitments or contingent liabilities  which may have a material adverse impact on the liquidity or capital resources of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is also party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments  or market risk  is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the management of interest rate sensitivity seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to provide consistent net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the company has an asset liability management committee alco which is responsible for establishing policies to limit exposure to interest rate risk  and to ensure procedures are established to monitor compliance with those policies 
those procedures include reviewing the company s asset and liability policies  setting prices and terms on rate sensitive products  and monitoring and measuring the impact of interest rate changes on the company s earnings and capital 
the company s board of directors reviews the guidelines established by the alco 
since december of  the federal reserve has increased short term target rates times  basis points each time to from 
during this time frame longer term interest rates have remained relatively unchanged resulting in a flattening and inversion of the yield curve 
the short term interest rate increases have caused continued net interest margin compression as short term deposits and borrowings on the company s liability sensitive balance sheet reprice into the current rate environment while security purchases and loan originations and refinances were being done at the stable longer term rates 
during the past month period of rising short term interest rates  the company has continued to practice conservative balance sheet management strategies by attempting to extend the maturities of its rate sensitive liabilities and shorten the maturity or repricing term of its rate sensitive assets 
this conservative balance sheet management strategy has resulted in additional margin pressure and reduction in net interest income during the prior years 
management believes this balance sheet strategy best positions the company and lessens its risk against future interest rate fluctuations 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management process is to maximize earnings and return on capital within acceptable levels of risk 
the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  and it seeks to maintain an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk irr in varying rate environments 
the primary tools used by the company in managing rate risk are income simulation and net portfolio value modeling techniques 
interest rate risk can result from timing differences in the maturity repricing of an institution s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts  the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  and the difference in the behavior of the various lending and funding rates  sometimes referred to as basis risk 
given the potential types and differing related characteristics of irr  it is important that the company maintain an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify its primary sources of irr 
the company also recognizes that effective management of irr includes an understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow through its income statements 
accordingly  the company not only looks at a month horizon when managing its exposure to irr  it also considers a longer term strategic horizon 
it is the company s objective to manage its exposure to irr  understanding that it is in the business of taking on rate risk and the elimination of such risk is not possible 
it is also understood that as exposure to irr is reduced  it may also result in net interest margin being reduced 
management believes the modeling and analysis of net interest income earnings at risk and net portfolio value value at risk in different interest rate environments provides the most meaningful measure of irr 
net interest income simulation analysis captures both the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice and the probability that they will do so 
net interest income simulation also attends to the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items  and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
finally  net interest income simulation permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates  but also of proposed strategies for responding to them 
net portfolio value represents the fair value of net assets determined as the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities using a discounted cash flow technique 
the following table measures the company s irr exposure in terms of the percentage change in its net interest income and net portfolio value as a result of hypothetical changes in basis point increments in market interest rates 
the table quantifies the changes in net interest income and net portfolio value to parallel shifts in the yield curve 
the column percentage change in net interest income measures the change to the next twelve month s projected net interest income  due to parallel shifts in the yield curve 
the column percentage change in net portfolio value measures changes in the current fair value of assets and liabilities to parallel shifts in the yield curve 
the column npv capital ratio measures the ratio of the fair value of net assets to the fair value of total assets at the base case and in basis point incremental interest rate shocks 
the company uses these percentage changes as a means to measure irr exposure and quantifies those changes against guidelines set by the board of directors as part of the company s irr policy 
the company s current irr exposure is within those guidelines set forth

del del 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
historically  the most common method of estimating irr was to measure the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at a specific point in time gap  typically one year 
under this method  a company is considered liability sensitive when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets within the one year horizon 
however  assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree 
as a result  the company s gap does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income
