we recognized a gain of million from the sale 
highlight of results of operations revenues for fiscal were  million  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal with the exception of the data communications division  we achieved revenue increases in all business segments  led by growth in sunpower due to an increase in demand and unit production of solar power products and the consumer and computation division as a result of higher demand for our psoc family of mixed signal arrays 
gross margin increased in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to increased sales volumes  improved average selling prices asps and reduced manufacturing cost structures 
for fiscal  total research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses increased million compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the stock based compensation expense recorded under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  coupled with increases in other employee related compensation charges 
as discussed further below  we adopted sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal and research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense of approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents results of operations revenues year ended december  january  january  in thousands consumer and computation division data communications division memory and imaging division sunpower other total revenues consumer and computation division revenues from the consumer and computation division increased approximately million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in sales of our psoc products  driven by increased demand and market penetration in consumer applications 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a decline of approximately million in sales of our communications based  general purpose clock business  primarily due to slowing demand in the base station market in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  sales of our pc clock products declined approximately million year over year  primarily because we divested the product line during the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from the consumer and computation division increased approximately million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in sales of our psoc products  driven by strong demand in consumer applications and continued expansion in computation platforms with major personal computer original equipment manufacturers 
in addition  continued adoption of our family of usb products in personal computer applications and consumer devices contributed an increase of approximately million in revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in sales of our general purpose clock and pc clock products 
data communications division revenues from the data communications division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal the decrease was attributable in part to a decline of approximately million in sales of our network search engine products 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we sold a portion of our network search engine product line to netlogic 
in addition  the decrease was attributable in part to a decline of approximately million in sales of our specialty memory products primarily due to a greater than expected slowdown in the base station market 
revenues from the data communications division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this decrease was partially attributable to the decline of approximately million in sales of certain programmable logic devices as they reached an end of life cycle 
softness in customer buying patterns in specialty memories and network search engine products also contributed a decline of approximately million in revenues 
memory and imaging division revenues from the memory and imaging division increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this increase was attributable to an increase of 
table of contents approximately million in sales of our memory products primarily due to increased demand for networking and communications applications and improved asps for the products 
revenues from the memory and imaging division decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared to revenues generated in fiscal this decrease was attributable to a decrease of approximately million in sales of our memory products  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in sales of our image sensor products 
the decrease in the sales of our memory products was primarily attributable to the decrease in the sales of our micropower and pseudo sram revenues for the mobile phone market primarily due to a general market transition to other products which we did not manufacture 
the increase in the sales of our image sensor products was primarily due to a full year of revenue contribution from fillfactory  which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  and ten months of revenue contributions from smal camera technologies smal  which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal sunpower revenues from the sales of sunpower products increased million  or  compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in revenues was attributable to continued increases in unit production and unit shipments of both solar cells and solar modules as sunpower continued to expand its solar manufacturing capacity to meet strong global demand 
during the first nine months of fiscal  sunpower had one solar cell manufacturing line in operation with an approximate annual production capacity of megawatts 
since then  sunpower has added three new production lines capable of producing approximately megawatts per year 
as of the end of fiscal  sunpower had a total of four production lines with annual production capacity of megawatts 
revenues increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared with revenues in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to additional manufacturing capacity  coupled with higher demand for sunpower s solar cells and panels driven by a strong global solar market 
other revenues increased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared with revenues generated in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million generated by svtc 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we signed a definitive agreement to sell svtc to two private equity firms 
revenues decreased million in fiscal  or approximately  compared with revenues generated in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in revenues generated by slm 
the decrease in slm s revenues was primarily due to the decline in royalty revenues from sony as the use of certain slm technology by sony came to an end in the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of revenues gross margin year ended december  january  january  in thousands cost of revenues gross margin gross margin on a consolidated basis increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volumes  coupled with an overall improvement in the asps for our products 
in addition  increased efficiencies in our wafer fab utilization and improvement in the memory and imaging division s gross margin year over year due to increased asps and reduced manufacturing cost structures contributed to higher overall gross margin 
the increase in gross margin 
table of contents was partially impacted by product mix  as sunpower with lower margins became a larger portion of our business and sales volumes from the data communications division with higher margins declined 
sunpower accounted for approximately of our total business in fiscal compared with only in fiscal our data communications division accounted for approximately of our total business in fiscal compared with in fiscal in addition  gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
r as we recorded approximately million of stock based compensation expense in cost of revenues 
the impact of stock based compensation was immaterial in fiscal gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes coupled with the decline in the overall asps 
in addition  gross margin was also impacted by product mix  as sunpower with lower margins became a larger component of our business and volumes from the data communications division with higher margins declined 
during the second half of fiscal  gross margin was also negatively impacted by certain manufacturing constraints and other one time charges 
inventory reserves our gross margin has also been impacted by the timing of inventory adjustments related to inventory write downs and the subsequent sale of these written down products caused by the general state of our business 
during fiscal  and  net impact of the inventory adjustments was a charge benefit of million  million and million  respectively 
the inventory reserve balance was million and million as of december  and january   respectively 
we record inventory write downs as a result of our normal analysis of demand forecasts and the aging profile of the inventory 
we record charges to cost of revenues to write down the carrying values of our inventories when their estimated market values are less than their carrying values 
the inventory write downs reflect estimates of future market pricing relative to the costs of production and inventory carrying values and projected timing of product sales 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and volatile 
in recent years  a combination of global economic conditions and a slowing growth rate in the demand for semiconductors  coupled with worldwide increases in semiconductor production capacity  caused significant declines in demand and average selling prices for semiconductor components 
these trends could continue in the future and could cause us to re evaluate our inventory costs  which could result in additional inventory reserves 
at the time of an inventory write down  we make a determination  based on demand forecasts and the aging profile of the inventory  that there is a very high probability that the inventory that was reserved would not be sold 
once the inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established  however  for tracking purposes  the write down is recorded as a reserve on the balance sheets 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 the contra asset account is relieved at the time the inventory is either sold or scrapped 
at december   the remaining inventory reserve represented the value of excess and obsolete inventories that have not been scrapped or sold 
research and development r d year ended december  january  january  in thousands r d as a percentage of revenues r d expenditures increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to stock based compensation expense of million as we implemented sfas no 
r in fiscal and an increase of million in other employee related compensation expense primarily due to increases in amounts recorded under the employee bonus plans and salary increases 
the 
table of contents increase in r d expenditures was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in repair and maintenance related expenses and approximately million in depreciation 
r d expenditures decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately million in employee related compensation expenses and million in depreciation 
the decrease in employee related compensation expenses was primarily attributable to the termination of employees under the restructuring measures implemented in fiscal  coupled with a decrease in stock based compensation charges primarily as a result of terminated employees and a decrease in acquisition related contingent compensation charges 
the decrease in depreciation was primarily attributable to the removal of excess property and equipment under the restructuring measures  coupled with the savings resulted from the changes in the useful lives of certain equipment and production assets during fiscal in addition  r d expenditures decreased by million for sunpower primarily due to the completion of certain r d efforts related to sunpower s solar cell products and production line in the philippines in late fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a year ended december  january  january  in thousands sg a as a percentage of revenues sg a expenditures increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase was partially attributable to stock based compensation expense of million as we implemented sfas no 
r in fiscal and an increase of million in other employee related compensation expense primarily due to increases in amounts recorded under the employee bonus plans  salary increases and additional headcount and payroll costs mainly to support the growth of sunpower s business  particularly in areas of sales  marketing  finance and information technology 
in addition  expenses related to professional services increased approximately million primarily due to higher legal expenses incurred in connection with our strategic reviews and the department of justice investigations 
the increase in sg a expense was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in sales commissions primarily because we implemented a new plan in fiscal to reduce commission rates 
sg a expenditures increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase was partially attributable to a one time benefit of million recognized in fiscal associated with the reduction of the allowance for uncollectible loans under our employee stock purchase assistance plan as a result of a significant reduction in outstanding balances under the plan at that time 
in addition  the increase was attributable to an increase of approximately million in employee related compensation expenses 
the increase in employee related compensation expenses was primarily due to severance and benefits relating to the termination of certain employees not included in our restructuring plan  partially offset by savings generated from the restructuring measures implemented in fiscal the increase in sg a expense was also attributable to an increase of approximately million in advertising expenses 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets year ended december  january  january  in thousands amortization of acquisition related intangible assets as a percentage of revenues 
table of contents acquisition related intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
the decrease in amortization in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in amortization of certain purchased technology intangibles  as they had been fully amortized during fiscal and  or sold to netlogic in connection with the sale of a portion of our nse product line during fiscal the decrease in amortization in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in amortization of certain purchased technology intangibles as they had been fully amortized during fiscal in process research and development charges no in process research and development charges were recorded in fiscal we recorded in process research and development charges of million related to our acquisition of smal in fiscal  and million related to our acquisition of fillfactory nv fillfactory in fiscal  as technological feasibility associated with the in process research and development projects had not been established and no alternative future use existed 
in process research and development projects related to smal included the development of first generation automotive cameras and mobile phone sensors 
in process research and development projects related to fillfactory included the development of new image sensors in fillfactory s custom and standard product applications 
specifically  the custom products include industrial  automotive  medical and high end photography  and the standard products include high end photography  digital still cameras and wireless terminal cameras 
in assessing the projects  we considered key characteristics of the technology as well as its future prospects  the rate technology changes in the industry  product life cycles  and various projects stage of development 
the value of in process research and development was determined using the income approach method  which calculated the sum of the discounted future cash flows attributable to the projects once commercially viable 
discount rates were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted to reflect the stage of completion of the projects and the level of risks associated with the projects 
discount rates ranging from to were used for smal s projects and to were used for fillfactory s projects 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined by identifying the research and development expenses invested in the project as a ratio of the total estimated development costs required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the following table summarizes certain information of each significant project as of the acquisition date smal projects estimated stage of completion as of acquisition date total cost incurred as of acquisition date total estimated costs to complete estimated completion dates first generation automotive cameras million million march mobile phone sensors million million march fillfactory projects estimated stage of completion as of acquisition date total cost incurred as of acquisition date total estimated costs to complete estimated completion dates industrial million million may digital still cameras and wireless terminal cameras million million june medical million million june automotive million million january high end photography million million april

restructuring the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in demand for  and supply of  semiconductors 
in some cases  industry downturns have lasted more than a year 
prior experience has shown that restructuring of operations  resulting in significant restructuring charges  may become necessary if an industry downturn persists 
in addition  events and circumstances specific to us may result in restructuring charges 
we initiated one restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan  one in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan and one in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan 
during fiscal and  we completed all obligations related to the fiscal restructuring plan and the fiscal restructuring plan  respectively 
as of december   the fiscal restructuring plan has been substantially completed with remaining reserves consisting of lease payments for restructured facilities 
in january  we announced a plan intended to reduce costs and losses by approximately million per quarter 
this plan included restructuring activities implemented under the fiscal restructuring plan  and various other initiatives to reduce discretionary spending and reduce our losses 
as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal  we had realized these savings  which are described below 
the initiatives implemented under our fiscal restructuring plan were intended to generate savings by reducing employee related costs  disposing of excess equipment thereby reducing depreciation costs  reducing facility costs by existing certain facilities and ceasing operations of our subsidiary silicon magnetic systems sms 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we have realized these savings as follows approximately million in employee related compensation expenses due to the termination of employees  approximately million in depreciation as a result of the removal of excess property and equipment from operations  approximately million in rent expense due to the closure of facilities  and approximately million as a result of discontinuing the operations of sms 
the initiatives to reduce the amount of discretionary spending and reduce our losses were intended to generate savings of approximately million 
we achieved these savings during the second quarter of fiscal and in subsequent periods 
gain on divestitures during fiscal  we completed two divestitures and recognized total gains of million related to the divestitures

in addition  interest income includes interest income associated with the outstanding loans under the stock purchase assistance plan 
interest income increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal interest income increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in interest income in both periods was primarily driven by higher average cash and investment balances  coupled with higher interest rates 
interest expense interest expense is primarily associated with our convertible subordinated notes and collateralized debt instruments 
in addition  interest expense also includes interest expense related to sunpower s outstanding customer advances 

table of contents interest expense increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to an increase of million in interest expense related to sunpower s outstanding customer advances  partially offset by a decrease of million in interest expense associated with our collateralized debt instruments  which were paid in full during the first quarter of fiscal we paid approximately million of interest expense related to our convertible subordinated notes notes in both fiscal and interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we redeemed all of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes  resulting in a decrease of million in interest expense in fiscal in addition  the decrease in interest expense was partially attributable to a decrease of approximately million in interest expense associated with our collateralized debt instruments due to lower principal balances

in addition  during fiscal  we completed the sale of our equity investment in another public company and recognized a gain of million 
during fiscal  one of the privately held companies in which we held an equity investment was acquired by a public company  resulting in us receiving shares in the public company 
as a result of the transaction  we recognized a gain of million 
investment impairment charges we have equity investments in both public and privately held companies 
we recognize an impairment charge when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge on an investment in a public company  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our impairment assessment on investments in privately held companies includes the review of each investee s 
table of contents financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 
we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  as the decline in values of certain of our investments in both public and privately held companies was deemed other than temporary 
deferred compensation plan in fiscal  we adopted a deferred compensation plan  which provides certain key employees  including our executive management  with the option to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for retirement 
we do not make contributions to the deferred compensation plan other than the amounts withheld from the employees and we do not guarantee returns on the investments 
participant deferrals and investment gains and losses remain our assets and are subject to claims of general creditors 
as of december  and january   deferred compensation plan assets totaled million and million  respectively  and liabilities totaled million and million  respectively 
we account for the deferred compensation plan in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for deferred compensation arrangements where amounts earned are held in a rabbi trust and invested 
in accordance with eitf no 
 the liabilities are marked to market with the offset being recorded as an operating expense or credit 
the assets excluding the amounts invested in our common stock are marked to market with the offset being recorded in other income expense  net 
no entries are recorded for the amounts invested in our common stock because the amounts are accounted for as treasury stock 
all non cash expense and credits recorded under the deferred compensation plan were included in the following line items in the consolidated statements of operations year ended december  january  january  in thousands changes in fair value of assets recorded in other income expense  net changes in fair value of liabilities recorded in cost of revenues research and development selling  general and administrative total expense  net benefit from provision for income taxes we recorded tax expense of million in fiscal  compared to a tax benefit of million in fiscal and a tax benefit of million in fiscal the tax expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to non us taxes on income earned in certain countries and us federal and state alternative minimum tax 
the tax benefit in fiscal was primarily attributable to amortization of purchased intangibles and a release of previously accrued taxes as discussed below  offset by non us taxes on income earned in certain countries that is not offset by current year net operating losses in other countries 
the tax benefit in fiscal was primarily attributable to a release of previously accrued taxes as discussed below  offset by foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to our assessment of the utilization of loss carryovers and earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates 
deferred tax assets of million at december  were fully reserved due to uncertainty of realization 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the third quarter of fiscal  the statute of limitations expired for several tax jurisdictions 
the expiration of the statute of limitations led to management s assessment that previously accrued income taxes were no longer necessary 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded benefits of million and million  respectively  for the release of previously accrued income taxes 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative  bilateral tax treaty  regulatory and judicial developments in the many countries in which we and our affiliates do business 
we and our affiliates file tax returns in each jurisdiction in which we are registered to do business 
in the us and many of the state jurisdictions  and in many foreign countries in which we file tax returns  a statute of limitations period exists 
after a statute of limitations period expires  the respective tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period 
similarly  we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid 
our tax returns could be subject to examination by various tax authorities in countries in which we operate 
the internal revenue service irs is currently conducting an audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal and as of december   no material adjustments have been proposed by the irs 
however  the irs has not completed their examination and there can be no assurance that there will be no significant adjustments upon the completion of their review 
during fiscal  non us tax authorities commenced tax audits of our subsidiaries in the philippines and india 
management believes that the ultimate outcome of these non us examinations will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

table of contents during fiscal  we used million to redeem the convertible subordinated notes 
this was partially offset by the proceeds of million from the issuance of common shares under the employee stock plans 
liquidity during the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to million 
stock repurchases under this program may be made through open market and privately negotiated transactions at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions 
the stock repurchase program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 
the stock repurchase program terminated all previous repurchase programs 
at the end of fiscal  we had million of aggregate principal amount of our outstanding notes that were due in june during the first quarter of fiscal  we called for redemption of all of our notes

interest on the sunpower debentures will be payable on february and august of each year  commencing august  the sunpower debentures will mature on february  holders may require sunpower to repurchase all or a portion of their sunpower debentures on each of february   february  and february   or if sunpower experiences certain types of corporate transactions constituting a fundamental change 
any repurchase of the sunpower debentures pursuant to these provisions will be for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the sunpower debentures to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  sunpower may redeem some or all of the sunpower debentures on or after february  for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the sunpower debentures to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the sunpower debentures may  under certain circumstances at their option  convert the sunpower debentures into cash and  if applicable  shares of sunpower class a common stock initially at a conversion rate of shares equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  at any time on or prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date 
the applicable conversion rate will be subject to customary adjustments in certain circumstances 
on june   we entered into a synthetic lease agreement for us manufacturing and office facilities 
the lease agreement requires us to purchase the properties or to arrange for the properties to be acquired by a third party at lease expiration  which is june if we had exercised our right to purchase all the properties subject to this lease at december   we would have been required to make a payment totaling million 
we are required to maintain restricted cash or investments to serve as collateral for this lease

borrowings outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a rate of the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate for us dollar draws  or libor plus for euro dollar draws on the first million of borrowings and the greater of the prime rate plus or federal funds rate plus for us dollar draws  or libor plus for euro dollar draws on any borrowings over million 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility 
we have outstanding purchase obligations  which represent principally our open purchase orders for services  software  manufacturing equipment  building improvements and supplies 
purchase obligations are defined as enforceable agreements that are legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including quantity  price and timing 
as of december   non cancelable purchase obligations totaled million 
in addition  sunpower has agreements with various polysilicon  ingot and wafer vendors and manufacturers 
as of december   total obligations related to such supply agreements were million 
capital resources and financial condition our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities

as of december   cypress held million shares of sunpower class b common stock 
based on quoted market prices  the fair value of cypress s ownership interest in sunpower was approximately billion at the end of fiscal  with a range of billion and billion during fiscal as our financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  the fair value of cypress s ownership interest in sunpower is not recorded as an asset in the consolidated balance sheets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  sunpower completed a follow on public offering of million shares of its class a common stock and received total proceeds  net of transaction costs  of approximately million 
sunpower intends to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  and potentially for further expansion of its philippines manufacturing facilities 
sunpower may also use a portion of the proceeds to purchase its philippines manufacturing facility from cypress  which sunpower has the option to do under the lease agreement 
in addition  sunpower may use proceeds of this offering for the acquisition of  or investment in  complementary businesses  technologies or other assets  and to invest in joint ventures 
sunpower may undertake such transactions in furtherance of its strategy to broaden its supply chain opportunities  increase the efficiency of the downstream channel and reduce the cost of its products delivered to end customers 
sunpower may also use a portion of the proceeds for prepayments to vendors of polysilicon  ingots and wafers 
we believe that liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents and investments and our borrowing arrangements will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
table of contents adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements including our debt obligations  we would be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital or debt to strengthen our financial position  facilitate growth  and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that arise 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations payments due by year total and and beyond in thousands notes customer advances  including interest lease commitments purchase obligations synthetic lease sunpower polysilicon purchase commitments other total contractual obligations during the first quarter of fiscal  we called for redemption of all of our notes  resulting in us issuing million shares of our common stock and paying million in cash to the holders of our notes

during the first quarter of fiscal  we made the decision to exit our synthetic lease and will exercise our option to purchase the properties for million using our restricted cash 
sunpower has agreements with several suppliers of polysilicon  ingots and wafers 
these agreements specify future purchase obligations  including quantities and pricing of products to be supplied by the suppliers  for periods up to years and there are certain consequences  such as forfeiture of advanced deposits and penalty payments relating to previous purchases  in the event that sunpower terminates the arrangements 
total future purchase obligations were million

woongjin  a provider of environmental products located in korea  to form woongjin energy co  ltd woongjin energy  a joint venture to manufacture mono crystalline silicon ingots 
woongjin energy is expected to begin manufacturing in the second half of fiscal  and sunpower expects to purchase approximately million of silicon ingots from woongjin energy through a five year agreement 
purchase obligations represent principally our non cancelable purchase orders for services  manufacturing equipment  building improvements and supplies 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations are defined as enforceable agreements that are legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including quantity  price and timing 
lease guarantee during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a strategic foundry partnership with grace semiconductor manufacturing corporation grace  pursuant to which we have transferred certain of our proprietary process technologies to grace s shanghai  china facility 
pursuant to a foundry agreement dated 
table of contents december   we purchase wafers from an affiliate of grace that are produced using these process technologies 
on december   we entered into a guarantee guarantee with cit technologies corporation lessor for the benefit of grace 
grace has leased from the lessor certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment pursuant to a master lease agreement between the lessor and grace 
under the guarantee  we have agreed to an unconditional guarantee to the lessor of the rental payments due under the master lease by grace 
the term of the lease runs for months commencing january  the guaranteed obligations of grace  payable quarterly in advance  equal approximately million for each calendar quarter during the term  for an aggregate amount equal to approximately million over the term 
if grace fails to pay any of the quarterly payments  we will be obligated to pay within days of written demand from the lessor such amounts 
if we fail to pay such amount  interest will accrue at a rate of per annum on any unpaid amounts 
in addition  under the guarantee  we obtained an irrevocable letter of credit in an initial amount of approximately million to secure the payments under the guarantee after demand has been made by the lessor on us 
the amount available under the letter of credit will decline according to a schedule mutually agreed upon by us and the lessor during the term consistent with the quarterly reductions in the outstanding amounts under the master lease 
under the guarantee  if a default by us occurs  the lessor will be entitled to draw on the letter of credit 
in connection with the guarantee and effective upon the payment for  or receipt of  the leased equipment by the lessee  we were issued warrants to purchase approximately million ordinary shares of grace at an exercise price of per share during the fourth quarter of fiscal the guarantee is the first in a series that we intend to enter into from time to time in support of the grace s operations described above 
we currently expect that the maximum amount of all such guaranteed equipment lease obligations in support of grace will not exceed approximately million 
however  we are under no obligation to guarantee any future rent payments on such equipment leases for the benefit of grace and will do so only in our sole discretion 
financial commitment between cypress and sunpower in conjunction with sunpower s acquisition of powerlight  cypress entered into a commitment letter with sunpower during the fourth quarter of fiscal under which cypress will lend to sunpower up to million in cash in order to facilitate the financing of the acquisition or working capital requirements

the interest rate will be libor on the issuance date plus basis points  and the sunpower note will mature on the first anniversary of the issuance date 
a mandatory pre payment of any amounts outstanding under the sunpower note is due upon the closing of any bank credit  debt or equity financing completed by sunpower 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding 
in february  cypress and sunpower mutually terminated the commitment letter 
no borrowings were outstanding at the termination date 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease on june   we entered into an operating lease agreement  commonly known as a synthetic lease  for manufacturing and office facilities located in minnesota and california 
a synthetic lease obligation of million with restricted cash collateral was established during the second quarter of fiscal the synthetic lease requires us to purchase the properties or to arrange for the properties to be acquired by a third party at lease 
table of contents expiration  which is june in addition  we may extend the lease if the lessor allows 
if we had exercised our right to purchase all the properties subject to the synthetic lease at december   we would have been required to make a payment totaling million the termination value 
if we exercise our option to sell the properties to a third party  the proceeds from such a sale could be less than the properties termination value  and we would be required to pay the difference up to the guaranteed residual value of million the guaranteed residual value 
we are required to evaluate periodically the expected fair value of the properties at the end of the lease term 
in the event we determine that it is estimable and probable that the expected fair value of the properties at the end of the lease term will be less than the termination value  we will ratably accrue the loss over the remaining lease term 
we have performed an analysis and determined a loss contingency accrual is required 
as of december   the loss contingency accrual was million  representing the total amounts recognized through the end of fiscal the fair value analysis on the properties was performed by management with the assistance of independent appraisal firms 
we are required to maintain restricted cash or investments to serve as collateral for this lease 
as of december   the balance of restricted cash and accrued interest was million 
in addition  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants associated with the synthetic lease 
as of december   we were in compliance with such financial covenants 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we made the decision to exercise our option to purchase the properties under the synthetic lease for million using the restricted cash 
we expect to complete the termination of the synthetic lease by the end of the first quarter of fiscal equity option contracts as of december   we had outstanding a series of equity options on our common stock with an initial cost of million that were originally entered into in fiscal these options were included in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contracts require physical settlement 
upon expiration of the options  if our stock price is above the threshold price of per share  we will receive a settlement value totaling million in cash 
if our stock price is below the threshold price of per share  we will receive million shares of our common stock 
alternatively  the contracts may be renewed and extended 
during fiscal and  we received total premiums of approximately million and million  respectively  upon extensions of the contracts 
the amounts were recorded in additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets 
the equity option contracts expired in february upon expiration of the option contracts  our stock price was below the threshold price of per share 
as a result  we received million shares of our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt this pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal and are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates 
table of contents inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt this pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal and are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which provides guidance on the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
states that entities must quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the entity s current year consolidated financial statements 
sab no 
prescribes two approaches to assessing the materiality of misstatements the rollover approach  which quantifies misstatements based on the amount of error originating in the current year income statement  and the iron curtain approach  which quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the cumulative effect existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year 
if under either approach  misstatements are deemed material  the entity is required to adjust its financial statements  including correcting prior year financial statements  even though such correction was and continues to be immaterial to the prior year financial statements 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require the entity to amend previously filed reports  rather  such corrections may be made the next time the entity files its comparative prior period statements 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  which requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the company s balance sheet  and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income  effective fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas no

in june  the fasb ratified the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for compensated absences  which requires that compensation expense associated with a sabbatical leave  or other similar benefit arrangement  be accrued over the requisite service period during which an employee earns the benefit 
eitf issue no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and should be recognized as either a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods 
we will adopt this pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal and expect the impact of the adoption will be a charge of approximately million to retained earnings  although there can be no assurance of this 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal and are currently evaluating the impact of this provision on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and the data used to prepare them 

table of contents our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and employee loans  inventories  valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets  goodwill impairments  investment impairments  stock based compensation  warranty reserves  litigation  investigation and settlement costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition we generate revenue by selling products to distributors  various types of manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers oems  electronic manufacturing service providers emss and  in the case of sunpower  system integrators 
we recognize revenue on sales to oems  emss and system integrators upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
sales to certain distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors with price protection  other allowances and stock rotation under certain circumstances 
given the uncertainties associated with the rights given to these distributors  revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the end customers 
revenue recognition is based upon receiving notification from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers 
reported information includes product resale price  quantity and end customer shipment information as well as inventory on hand 
reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred income balances 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment  relieve inventory for the value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributors  and defer the related margin as deferred income on sales to distributors in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a reduction to deferred income at the time the distributors sell the products to the end customers 
we record as a reduction to revenue reserves for sales returns  price protection and allowances  based upon historical experience rates and for any specific known customer amounts 
we also provide certain distributors and emss with volume pricing discounts  such as rebates and incentives  which are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale 
these volume discounts have not been significant historically 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and employee loans we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience  specific customer creditworthiness  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding 
table of contents receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
we have outstanding loans  consisting of principal and cumulative accrued interest  to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of our common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible loans 
in determining the allowance for uncollectible loans  management considered various factors  including a review of borrower demographics including geographic location and job grade  loan quality and a fair value analysis of the loans and the underlying collateral 
the allowance was determined by management with the assistance of an analysis performed by an independent appraisal firm 
if the underlying assumptions supporting our reserve requirements  including the value of our stock price  change  future operating results could be adversely affected 
valuation of inventories management periodically reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves 
we write down our inventories for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves and obsolescence reserves 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a device exceeds demand for that device and or when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than a certain period 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis 
if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we 
table of contents make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed during the fourth quarters of fiscal  and  did not result in an impairment charge 
however  changes in these estimates could cause one or more of the businesses to be valued differently  which could result in a material impairment of our goodwill in the future 
valuation of investments we have equity investments in both public and privately held companies 
we review our investments periodically for impairment and the assessment requires significant judgment 
we recognize an impairment charge when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
fair values for investments in public companies are determined using quoted market prices 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge on a publicly traded investment  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
our ability to recover our strategic investments in private  non marketable equity securities is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how well their products are ultimately accepted  as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations and to grow 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
our impairment assessment on investments in privately held companies includes the review of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise  for example  when we hold contractual rights that give us a preference over the rights of other investors 
we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities in the past 
if market conditions deteriorate in the future and companies in our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds  the funds may not be available to them or they may receive lower valuations  which could result in impairment of our investments 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our future stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents sunpower warranty reserves it is customary in sunpower s business and industry to warrant or guarantee the performance of solar panels at certain levels of conversion efficiency for extended periods  often as long as years 
it is also customary to warrant or guarantee the functionality of sunpower s solar cells and imaging detectors for at least one year 
sunpower therefore maintains warranty reserves to cover potential liability that could arise from these guarantees 
sunpower s potential liability is generally in the form of product replacement 
sunpower s warranty reserves reflect its best estimate of such liabilities and are based on its analysis of product returns  results of industry standard accelerated testing and various other assumptions that sunpower believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
sunpower has sold solar cells only since late  and  accordingly  has a limited history upon which to base its estimates of warranty expense 
sunpower s warranty reserve includes specific accruals for known product issues and an accrual for an estimate of incurred but not reported product issues based on historical activity 
due to effective product testing and the short turnaround time between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures  warranty expenses based on historical activity were not significant as of and for the fiscal years or interim periods presented 
litigation  investigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation or investigations is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such litigation or investigations  we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates  which could require us to record additional costs 
accounting for income taxes our global operations involve manufacturing  research and development and selling activities 
profits from non us activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to us tax until repatriated to the us it is our intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest and foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of our non equity investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our portfolio 
the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes notes is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature 
the fair market value of the notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair market value of the notes will increase as the market price of our common stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the notes was approximately million based on quoted market prices 
a increase in quoted market prices would increase the estimated fair value of the notes to approximately million  and a decrease in the quoted market prices would decrease the estimated fair value of the notes to million 
the majority of our revenues  expenses and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the euro 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
our subsidiary sunpower entered into a series of euro forward contracts to hedge forecasted foreign denominated revenues 
the total notional amount of these contracts was million as of december  if the forecasted cash flow fails to materialize  sunpower will have to close out the contracts at the then prevailing market rates  resulting in gains or losses 
a unfavorable currency movement would result in a loss of approximately million on these contracts 
investments in public and privately held companies we have investments  including marketable equity securities and warrants  in certain public companies other than sunpower 
the marketable equity securities consist of common stock and are classified as available for sale investments 
they are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  our investments include warrants to purchase shares of a public company s common stock 
these warrants are classified as derivative instruments and are carried at fair value with the resulting gains or losses recognized in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the common stock and warrants is subject to market price volatility 
as of december   the fair value of our marketable equity securities was million 
a increase in the stock prices of our investments would increase the fair value of our investments by approximately million  and a decrease in the stock prices would decrease the fair value of our investments by approximately million 
as of december   the fair value of our warrants classified as derivative instruments was million 
a increase in the stock price of the investee would increase the value of our warrants by approximately million  and a decrease in the stock price would decrease the value of our warrants by approximately million 
our investment portfolio also includes warrants that are not classified as derivative instruments or available for sale securities 
these warrants are carried at cost and as of december   the carrying value of these warrants was million 

table of contents we have investments in several privately held companies  many of which can be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as our equity investments generally do not permit us to exert significant influence or control  these amounts generally represent our cost of the investments  less any adjustments we make when we determine that an investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost 
as of december   the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was million 
stock purchase assistance plan spap as of december   we had million of principal and cumulative accrued interest relating to loans made to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved spap program 
we made the loans to employees for the purpose of purchasing our common stock 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of our common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
in accordance with the program  the chief executive officer and the board of directors did not participate in this program 
to date  write offs have been immaterial 
as of december   we had an allowance for uncollectible loans of million 
in determining the allowance for uncollectible loans  management considered various factors  including a review of borrower demographics including geographic location and job grade  loan quality and an independent fair value analysis of the loans and the underlying collateral 
as of december   the carrying value of the loans exceeded the underlying common stock collateral by million 
the carrying value of the loans would exceed the underlying common stock collateral by million if our stock price increased  and by million if our stock price decreased 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented certain new terms for the spap program in an effort to minimize risks and collect the outstanding accrued interest and principal balances 
these changes to the spap program include  but are not limited to  a requirement to make interest payments after the first quarter of fiscal  a collateral requirement  changes in the interest rates charged on outstanding loan balances  and the requirement to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of stock options or shares under our employee stock plans to pay down the outstanding balances in certain circumstances 
our security interest in the collateral is currently reflected in security agreements executed by each participant and account control agreements executed by and between us  the participant and the third party service provider who helps administer the plan 
we have received notice that the third party vendor who helped administer the plan terminated its relationship with us 
while the security agreement executed by each participant precludes them from taking certain action without our consent  the termination of the account control agreements could adversely impact our ability to collect on the collateral in the event of a default by the participant 
we are actively pursuing a new third party service provider to administer the plan
