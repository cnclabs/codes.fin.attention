item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  presented elsewhere in this form k

fiscal was impacted by non cash charges of  for impairment of long lived assets compared to of non cash charges for impairment of long lived assets in fiscal the implementation of the company s acquisition and strategic alliance strategies  and the costs associated with integrating new  under performing or unprofitable restaurants  acquired or otherwise operated by the company may affect the comparability of historical and future periods and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
operating performance of our restaurants is directly and heavily influenced by the overall state of the national and local economies where our restaurants are located 
when overall economic conditions negatively impact the financial performance of an individual restaurant  we periodically consider all the factors influencing that restaurant  such as operational efficiencies  local demographic changes  local construction activity  competition and other related factors 
we then assess the possibility of whether we can improve both the short term and long term financial results  at least to a level sufficient to recover our investment in the leasehold improvements and equipment assets 
there have been and likely will continue to be situations where we will make the decision that an asset is impaired and a write down is required

the lower same store sales also resulted in a higher labor cost as a percent of sales 
the hometown buffet division also had higher maintenance  repairs and utilities expense in the current year compared to the prior year 
management believes sales decreased because of general economic conditions including higher gas prices and increased competition in certain areas 
utility expense increased this year as compared to the prior year primarily because of higher costs for both electricity and gas 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company closed the jj north s restaurant in bend  oregon and acquired the western sizzlin in griffin  georgia 
the sales in the new western sizzlin were higher than the closed jj north s resulting in slightly higher sales for the year

the north s star division had higher maintenance  repairs and utilities expense in the current year compared to the prior year 
utility expense increased this year as compared to the prior year primarily because of higher costs for both electricity and gas 
the increase in income before income taxes in the florida division was primarily the result of lower depreciation and amortization expense and no impairment of long lived assets in the current year 
these improvements were partially offset by higher costs for food  labor and general and administrative expenses 
the increase in sales from the four new k bob s restaurants and the pecos diamond steakhouse of approximately million more than offset the sales loss of approximately million from the casa bonita restaurant closed during the third quarter of fiscal in the summit restaurant division

the increase in food costs primarily in the hometown buffet division was a result of menu improvements 
labor costs as a percentage of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and actual labor costs increased by  the increase in labor cost and as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from higher starting wages in certain markets in fiscal as compared to the fiscal year the minimum wage increases in arizona  colorado  florida  montana  and washington increased wage costs for the company starting in january in response to the increased costs  the company increased menu pricing in january with the goal of maintaining labor costs as percentage of sales consistent with prior results  although there can be no assurance that this will be the result see the discussion under risk factors 
occupancy and other expenses as a percent of total revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase as a percentage of revenues for the week period ended january  was primarily attributable to decreased revenues in the stores opened during both years and increased variable expenses

in addition  the company opened one pecos diamond steakhouse  one western sizzlin restaurant and five whistle junction restaurants during the year 
subsequent to year end  the company opened one additional western sizzlin restaurant  one additional whistle junction restaurant and one holiday house family restaurant 
the company has some of this equipment available from stores closed in previous periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire additional restaurants or locations or  if acquired  that these restaurants will have a positive contribution to the company s results of operations 
the company has a revolving line of credit with m i marshall ilsley bank the revolving line of credit which provides working capital for the company 
the revolving line of credit bears interest at libor plus two percent per annum and is renewable subject to credit review on an annual basis 
the revolving line of credit contains covenants which require the company to maintain certain financial ratios and other covenants that restrict the annual payment for capital expenditures and dividends 
as of january   the company is in compliance with these covenants

the company believes that available cash  availability under the revolving line of credit and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the next months 
management does not believe the net working capital deficit will have any effect on the company s ability to operate the business and meet obligations as they come due in the next months 
the company projects that operating cash flows will exceed planned capital expenditures in the next months and that funds will be available to return capital to stockholders in the form of dividends  share repurchases or both 
there can be no assurance  however  that cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and capital requirements for the next months or beyond 
it is possible that changes in the company s operating results  unavailable loan capacity from the existing credit facility  acceleration of the company s capital expenditure plans  potential acquisitions or other events may cause the company to seek additional financing 
additional financing may be raised through public or private equity and or debt financing or from other sources 
additionally  the company s revolving line of credit expires on june  although it is unlikely at this time  there can be no assurance that required financings will be available on acceptable terms or at all

impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass any associated higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
however  management has emphasized cost controls rather than price increases given the competitive pressure within the quick service restaurant industry 
critical accounting policies and judgments the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect the company s reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets periodically  the company records or reduces the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based upon recent past financial performance  tax reporting positions  and expectations of future taxable income 
the company expects to continue to record a valuation allowance on certain future tax benefits as required under sfas the assets are evaluated each period under the requirements of sfas property  buildings and equipment property and equipment and real property under capitalized leases are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the following useful lives years buildings building and leasehold improvements furniture  fixtures and equipment building and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or estimated economic life of the assets 
the life of the lease includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception for which failure to renew options would result in a substantial economic penalty 
if a lease option was not exercised in the future  any remaining unamortized leasehold improvements would be required to be recognized immediately which could result in a significant charge adversely affecting the operating results of that period 
repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred 
remodeling costs are generally capitalized 
the company s accounting policies regarding buildings and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets  the residual values to which the assets are depreciated and the determination as to what constitutes increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the company s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets primarily represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions 
as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company has ceased amortizing goodwill recorded in past business combinations effective as of january  as a result  there is no charge for goodwill amortization expense contained in the company s statements of operations for the years ended january   january  and january  sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit that included goodwill to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
the company performed the transitional impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of relevant reporting units was in excess of the fair value of those units 
this resulted in a transitional impairment loss of  which was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of a tax benefit of  in the first quarter of subsequent to adoption of sfas  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or when a triggering event occurs that indicates a potential impairment may have occurred in accordance with sfas future impairments of goodwill  if any  will adversely affect the results of operations in the periods recognized 
impairment of long lived assets the company determines that an impairment write down is necessary for locations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
any impairment which would adversely affect operating results in the affected period 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted net cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected net cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge and could adversely affect operating results in any period 
insurance programs the company is self insured for general liability claims 
the company has commercial insurance for casualty claims in excess of million per claim and million per year as a risk reduction strategy 
self insurance accruals include estimates based on historical information and expected future developments 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in actual liabilities that are materially different from the calculated accruals

and fasb statement no

sfas also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas and sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after september   which for us is the beginning of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires the recognition  in the financial statements  of the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which for us is the beginning of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf consensus  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
this eitf addresses the presentation of taxes in the income statement 
gross or net presentation may be elected for each different type of tax  but similar taxes should be presented consistently 
taxes within the scope of this eitf would include taxes that are imposed on a revenue transaction between a seller and a customer  for example  sales taxes  use taxes  value added taxes  and some types of excise taxes 
our accounting policy is to present the taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   which for us is the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of eitf on our consolidated results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements

this standard allows companies to elect fair value accounting for many financial instruments and other items that currently are not required to be accounted as such  allows different applications for electing the option for a single item or groups of items  and requires disclosures to facilitate comparisons of similar assets and liabilities that are accounted for differently in relation to the fair value option 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which for us is fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s principal exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes could have on its million revolving line of credit  of which  and  was outstanding as of january and april   respectively 
the revolving line of credit interest rate is libor plus two percent per annum averaging approximately in fiscal 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of pre tax earnings  the amount of which would depend on the amount outstanding on the line of credit 
all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on the company and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk the company purchases certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
typically the company uses these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  the company believes it will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting its menu pricing  menu mix or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower operating margins for our restaurant concepts
