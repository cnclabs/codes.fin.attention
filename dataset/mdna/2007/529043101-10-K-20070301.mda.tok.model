item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a self managed and self administered real estate investment trust formed under the laws of the state of maryland 
we operate in one segment and our primary business is the investment in and the acquisition  ownership and management of a geographically diverse portfolio of net leased office  industrial and retail properties 
substantially all of our properties are subject to triple net leases  which are generally characterized as leases in which the tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs and or cost increases for real estate taxes  utilities  insurance and ordinary repairs 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which we refer to as the code  commencing with our taxable year ended december  if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to shareholders 
when we use the terms lexington  the company  we  us and our  we mean lexington realty trust and all entities owned by us  including non consolidated entities  except where it is clear that the term means only the parent company 
references herein to our annual report are to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  all references to  and refer to our fiscal years ended  or the dates  as the context requires  december   december   and december   respectively 
we merged with newkirk realty trust  inc  or newkirk  on december   which we refer to as the merger 
unless otherwise noted  a the information in this annual report regarding items in our consolidated statements of operations as of december   does not include the business and operations of newkirk  and b the information in this annual report regarding items in our consolidated balance sheet  include the assets  liabilities and minority interests of newkirk 
in this discussion  we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events  many of which  by their nature  are inherently uncertain and outside our control 
these statements may relate to our future plans and objectives  among other things 
by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the anticipated results indicated in these forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause our results to differ  possibly materially  from those indicated in the forward looking statements include  among others  those discussed below under risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report and cautionary statements concerning forward looking statements in part i  of this annual report 
as of december   we owned or had interests in approximately real estate properties encompassing million rentable square feet 
during  we purchased properties  including properties acquired through the merger and non consolidated investments  for an aggregate capitalized cost of billion 
as of december   we  including through non consolidated entities  leased properties to approximately tenants in different industries 
our revenues and cash flows are generated predominantly from property rent receipts 
growth in revenue and cash flows is directly correlated to our ability to i acquire income producing properties and ii to re lease properties that are vacant  or may become vacant at favorable rental rates 
the challenge we face is finding investments that will provide an attractive return without compromising our real estate underwriting criteria 
we believe we have access to acquisition opportunities due to our relationship with developers  brokers  corporate users and sellers 
we have experienced minimal lease turnover in the recent past  and accordingly  minimal capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance that this will continue 
re leasing properties as leases expire and properties currently vacant at favorable effective rates is one of our primary focuses 
the primary risks associated with re tenanting properties are i the period of time required to find a new tenant  ii whether rental rates will be lower than previously received  iii the significant leasing costs such as commissions and tenant improvement allowances and iv the payment of operating costs such as real estate taxes and insurance while there is no offsetting revenue 
we address these risks by contacting tenants well in advance of lease maturity to get an understanding of their occupancy needs  contacting local brokers to determine the depth of the rental market and retaining local expertise to assist in the re tenanting of a property 
as part of the acquisition underwriting process  we focus on buying general purpose real estate which can be leased to other tenants without significant modification to the properties 
no assurance can be given that once a property becomes vacant it will subsequently be re let 

table of contents during  we sold eight properties  including one property through foreclosure  to unrelated third parties for a net sales price of million 
during  we sold eight properties  including one sold through a in a non consolidated entity  to unrelated parties for a net sales price of million 
in addition  we contributed seven properties to various non consolidated entity programs for million  which approximated carrying costs 
during  we sold eight properties for million to unrelated parties 
in addition  we contributed eight properties to various non consolidated entity programs for million  which approximated carrying costs 
also we were reimbursed for certain holding costs by the partners in the respective ventures 
inflation certain of the long term leases on our properties contain provisions that may mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive i scheduled fixed base rent increases and ii base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  a majority of the leases on our properties require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses 
in addition  the leases on our properties are generally structured in a way that minimizes our responsibility for capital improvements 
critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require our management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting policies which are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters 
accordingly  future reported financial conditions and results could differ materially from financial conditions and results reported based on management s current estimates 
business combinations 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which we refer to as sfas  and record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value 
on december   we acquired newkirk through the merger  which was a variable interest entity vie 
we follow the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  which we refer to as fin r  and  as a result  we have recorded the minority interest in newkirk at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition 
the value of the consideration issued in common shares was based upon a reasonable period before and after the date that the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
we allocate the purchase price of real estate acquired in accordance with sfas sfas requires that the fair value of the real estate acquired  which includes the impact of mark to market adjustments for assumed mortgage debt relating to property acquisitions  is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets  which includes land  building and improvements  and fixtures and equipment  of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the difference between the current in place lease rent and a management estimate of current market rents 
below market lease intangibles are recorded as part of deferred revenue and amortized into rental revenue over the non cancelable periods and any bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
above market leases are recorded as part of intangible assets and amortized as a direct charge against rental revenue over the non cancelable portion of the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and tenant relationships  is measured by the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
the value of in place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods and any bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
the value of customer relationships are amortized to expense over the applicable lease term plus expected renewal periods 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for leases  as amended  which we refer to as sfas sfas requires that revenue be recognized on a straight line basis over the 
table of contents term of the lease unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property 
renewal options in leases with rental terms that are lower than those in the primary term are excluded from the calculation of straight line rent  if they do not meet the criteria of a bargain renewal option 
in those instances in which we fund tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by us  revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant 
when we determine that the tenant allowances are lease incentives  we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin 
the lease incentive is recorded as a deferred expense and amortized as a reduction of revenue on a straight line basis over the respective lease term 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for sales of real estate  as amended  which we refer to as sfas the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  the gain is deferred and the finance  installment or cost recovery method  as appropriate  is applied until the sales criteria are met 
accounts receivable 
we continuously monitor collections from our tenants and would make a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and any specific tenant collection issues that we have identified 
as of december  and  we did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of real estate 
we evaluate the carrying value of all real estate held when a triggering event under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as amended  which we refer to as sfas  has occurred to determine if an impairment has occurred which would require the recognition of a loss 
the evaluation includes reviewing anticipated cash flows of the property  based on current leases in place  and an estimate of what lease rents will be if the property is vacant coupled with an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale 
however  estimating market lease rents and future sale proceeds is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results 
tax status 
we have made an election to qualify  and believe we are operating so as to qualify  as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax  provided that distributions to our shareholders equal at least the amount of our reit taxable income as defined under sections through of the code 
we are now permitted to participate in certain activities from which we were previously precluded in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the code 
lra  lexington contributions inc  which we refer to as lci  and lsac are taxable reit subsidiaries 
as such  we are subject to federal and state income taxes on the income we receive from these activities 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
properties held for sale 
we account for properties held for sale in accordance with sfas sfas requires that the assets and liabilities of properties that meet various criteria be presented separately in the statement of financial position  with assets and liabilities being separately stated 
the operating results of these properties are reflected as discontinued operations in the statement of operations 
properties that do not meet the held for sale criteria of sfas are accounted for as operating properties 
basis of consolidation 
we determine whether an entity for which we hold an interest should be consolidated pursuant fin r 
if the entity is not a variable interest entity  and we control the entity s voting shares or similar rights  the entity is consolidated 
fin r requires us to evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights 
liquidity and capital resources since becoming a public company  our principal sources of capital for growth have been the public and private equity markets  property specific debt  our credit facility  issuance of op units and undistributed cash flows 
we expect to continue to have access to and use these sources in the future  however  there are factors that may have a material adverse effect on our access to capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt to fund acquisitions is dependent upon our existing leverage  the value of the assets we are attempting to leverage and general economic conditions which may be outside of management s influence 
in february  we completed an offering of million series d preferred shares  at per share and a dividend rate of raising net proceeds of million 
during  we replaced our million unsecured revolving credit facility with a new million unsecured revolving credit facility  which bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points depending on our leverage as defined in the credit facility and matures in june our credit facility contains customary financial covenants  including restrictions on the level of indebtedness  amount of variable rate debt to be borrowed and net worth maintenance provisions 
as of december   we were 
table of contents in compliance with all covenants  million was outstanding  million was available to be borrowed and million in letters of credit were outstanding under our credit facility 
the mlp has a secured loan  which bears interest  at the election of the mlp  at a rate equal to either i libor plus basis points or ii the prime rate 
as of december   million was outstanding under the secured loan 
the secured loan is scheduled to mature in august  subject to two one year extensions 
the secured loan requires monthly payments of interest and quarterly principal payments of approximately million during the term of the secured loan  increasing to million per quarter during the extension periods 
the mlp is also required to make principal payments from the proceeds of property sales  refinancings and other asset sales if proceeds are not reinvested into net leased properties 
the required principal payments are based on a minimum release price set forth in the secured loan agreement for property sales and of proceeds from refinancings  economic discontinuance  insurance settlements and condemnations 
the secured loan has customary covenants which the mlp was in compliance with at december  during  we completed a common share offering of million shares raising aggregate net proceeds of million 
during  we issued  series c preferred shares  at per share and a dividend rate of  raising net proceeds of million 
in january  the mlp issued million in guaranteed exchangeable notes due in  which can be put by the holder every five years commencing the net proceeds of were used to repay indebtedness 
the notes are exchangeable at certain times by the holders into our common shares at a price of per share  however  the principal balance must be satisfied in cash 
during  in addition to the merger  we  including through non consolidated entities  obtained million in non recourse mortgage financings on properties at a fixed weighted average interest rate of 
the proceeds of the financings were used to partially fund acquisitions 
we have made equity commitments to our various joint venture programs  of which million remained unfunded as of december  this amount will be funded as investments are made by the joint venture programs 
in addition  the agreements governing certain of these joint venture programs provide the partners  under certain circumstances  the ability to put their interests to us for cash or common shares at our option 
exercise of these put rights could require us to use our resources to purchase these assets instead of more favorable investment opportunities 
as of december   the aggregate contingent commitment is calculated to be approximately million 
this assumes we issue common shares to settle the put and that we do not use our rights under the agreements governing the joint venture programs to block certain properties to be put to us 
dividends 
in connection with our intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we expect to continue paying regular dividends to our shareholders 
these dividends are expected to be paid from operating cash flows and or from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investments  we generally intend to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio  reserving such amounts as we consider necessary for the maintenance or expansion of properties in our portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as our board of trustees considers appropriate 
dividends paid to our common shareholders increased to million in  compared to million in and million in preferred dividends paid were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
although we receive the majority of our base rental payments on a monthly basis  we intend to continue paying dividends quarterly 
amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution are invested by us in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
we believe that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility  issuance of equity and debt  as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required by the company 
cash flows from operations as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows increased to million for from million for and million for the underlying drivers that impact working capital and therefore cash flows from operations are the timing of collection of rents  including reimbursements from tenants  the collection of advisory fees  payment of interest on mortgage debt and payment of operating and general and administrative costs 
we believe the net lease structure of the majority of our tenants leases enhances cash flows from operations since the payment and timing of operating costs related to the properties are generally borne directly by the tenant 
collection and timing of tenant rents is closely monitored by management as part of our cash management program 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities related primarily to investments in real estate properties  joint ventures and notes receivable 
cash provided by investing activities related primarily to collection of notes receivable  distributions from non consolidated entities in excess of accumulated earnings and proceeds from the sale of properties 
therefore  the fluctuation in investing activities relates primarily to the timing of investments and dispositions 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities during each year was primarily attributable to proceeds from equity offerings  non recourse mortgages and borrowings under our credit facility offset by dividend and distribution payments and debt payments 
upreit structure 
our upreit structure permits us to effect acquisitions by issuing to a property owner  as a form of consideration in exchange for the property  op units in our operating partnerships 
all outstanding op units are redeemable at certain times for common shares on a one for one basis and substantially all outstanding op units require us to pay quarterly distributions to the holders of such op units 
we account for outstanding op units in a manner similar to a minority interest holder 
the number of common shares that will be outstanding in the future should be expected to increase  and minority interest expense should be expected to decrease  as such op units are redeemed for our common shares 
in conjunction with several of our acquisitions  property owners were issued op units as a form of consideration in exchange for the property 
in connection with the merger  the mlp effected a reverse unit split pursuant to which each outstanding mlp unit was converted into mlp units totaling million mlp units  other than mlp units held directly or indirectly by us 
all of such interest are redeemable at certain times  only at the option of the holders  for cash or common shares  at our option  on a one for one basis at various dates and are not otherwise mandatorily redeemable by us 
during  one of our operating partnerships issued thousand units or in connection with an acquisition 
during  one of our operating partnerships issued million op units for approximately million in cash 
as of december   there were million op units outstanding 
of the total op units outstanding  approximately million are held by related parties 
generally holders of op units are entitled to receive distributions equal to the dividends paid to our common shareholders  except that certain op units have stated distributions in accordance with their respective partnership agreement 
to the extent that our dividend per share is less than a stated distribution per unit per the applicable partnership agreement  the stated distributions per unit are reduced by the percentage reduction in our dividend 
no op units have a liquidation preference 
as of december   there were million op units outstanding  other than op units held directly or indirectly by us 
financing revolving credit facility 
our million revolving credit facility  which expires june  bears interest at basis points over libor depending on our leverage as defined in the credit facility  our credit facility contains customary financial covenants including restrictions on the level of indebtedness  amount of variable debt to be borrowed and net worth maintenance provisions 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants  million was outstanding  million was available to be borrowed  and million letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility 
the mlp has a secured loan  which bears interest at the election of the mlp at a rate equal to either i libor plus basis points or ii the prime rate 
as of december   million was outstanding under the secured loan 
the secured loan is scheduled to mature in august  subject to two one year extensions 
the secured loan requires monthly payments of interest and quarterly principal payments of million during the term of the loan  increasing to million per quarter during the extension periods 
the mlp is also required to make principal payments from the proceeds of property sales  refinancings and other asset sales if proceeds are not reinvested into net leased properties 
the required principal payments are based on a minimum release price set forth in the secured loan agreement for property sales and of proceeds from refinancings  economic discontinuance  insurance settlements and condemnations 
the secured loan has customary covenants which the mlp was in compliance with at december  in january  the mlp issued million in guaranteed exchangeable notes due in  which can be put by the holder every five years commencing the net proceeds of were used to repay indebtedness 
debt service requirements 
our principal liquidity needs are the payment of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   there were billion of mortgages and notes payable outstanding  including discontinued operations 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was approximately 
the scheduled principal amortization and balloon payments for the next five years are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million in our ability to make certain of these payments will depend upon our rental revenues and our ability to refinance the mortgage related thereto  sell the related property  have available amounts under our credit facility or access other capital 
our ability to accomplish such goals will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the real estate industry  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt at the time  our equity in the mortgaged properties  the financial condition  the operating history of the mortgaged properties  the then current tax laws and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 

table of contents we expect to continue to use property specific  non recourse mortgages as we believe that by properly matching a debt obligation  including the balloon maturity risk  with a lease expiration  our cash on cash returns increase and the exposure to residual valuation risk is reduced 
in december  we informed the lender for our milpitas  california property that we would no longer make debt service payments and our intention to convey the property to the lender to satisfy the mortgage 
we recorded a million impairment charge in relating to this property and a gain on debt satisfaction of million upon foreclosure on the property by the lender in during  the company satisfied a million mortgage note by making a million cash payment plus assigning a million escrow to the lender  which resulted in a gain of million 
other lease obligations 
since our tenants generally bear all or substantially all of the cost of property operations  maintenance and repairs  we do not anticipate significant needs for cash for these costs  however  for certain properties  we have a level of property operating expense responsibility 
we generally fund property expansions with additional secured borrowings  the repayment of which is funded out of rental increases under the leases covering the expanded properties 
to the extent there is a vacancy in a property  we would be obligated for all operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance 
as of december   properties were fully vacant 
in addition certain leases require us to fund tenant expansions 
our tenants generally pay the rental obligations on ground leases either directly to the fee holder or to us as increased rent 
the annual ground lease rental payment obligations for each of the next five years is million in  million in  million in  million in and million in these amounts do not include payments due under bond leases in which a right of offset exists between the lease obligation and the debt service 
contractual obligations 
the following summarizes the company s principal contractual obligations as of december  s and thereafter total notes payable purchase obligations tenant incentives operating lease obligations includes ground lease payments and office rent 
amounts disclosed through include rent for our principal executive office which is fixed through and adjusted to fair market value as determined at january therefore  the amounts for and thereafter do not include principal executive office rent 
we have million in outstanding letters of credit 
we have approximately million of unfunded equity commitments to joint ventures 
in addition  certain of the joint venture agreements provide the partners  under certain circumstances  the ability to put their interest to us for cash or common shares 
the aggregate contingent commitment  as of december   is approximately million 
includes balloon payments 
capital expenditures 
due to the net lease structure  we do not incur significant expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain our properties 
however  as leases expire  we expect to incur costs in extending the existing tenant leases or re tenanting the properties 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
these expenditures are expected to be funded from operating cash flows or borrowings on our credit facility 
shares repurchase 
in september  our board of trustees approved a funding limit for the repurchase of million common shares op units  and authorized any repurchase transactions within that limit 
in november  our board of trustees approved an additional million common shares op units for repurchase  thereby increasing the funding limit to million common shares op units available for repurchase 
from september to march  we repurchased approximately million common shares op units at an average price of per common share op unit 
in november  our board of trustees increased the remaining amount of common shares op units eligible for repurchase  so that an aggregate of million common shares op units were then available for repurchase under the share repurchase program 
in  approximately million common shares op units have been repurchased at an average price of per share  in the open market and through private transactions with our employees 

table of contents results of operations comparison of to changes in the results of our operations are primarily due to the growth of our portfolio and costs associated with such growth 
of the increase in total gross revenues in of million  million is attributable to increases in rental revenue 
the remaining million increase in gross revenues in was attributable to an increase in tenant reimbursements of million and a decrease of million in advisory fees 
the increase in interest and amortization expense of million is due to increased leverage incurred relating to acquisitions and has been partially offset by interest savings resulting from scheduled principal amortization payments and mortgage satisfactions 
the increase in depreciation and amortization of million is due primarily to the growth in real estate and intangibles assets due to property acquisitions 
our general and administrative expenses increased by million primarily due to the accelerated amortization of time based non vested shares million  an increase in amortization of all non vested shares million and an increase in other personnel costs million 
the increase in property operating expenses of million is due primarily to incurring property level operating expenses for properties in which we have operating expense responsibility and an increase in vacancy 
debt satisfaction gains increased by million due to the timing of mortgage payoffs 
impairment charges increased by million due to an impairment of one property in non operating income increased million primarily due to the sale of a tenant bankruptcy claim in minority interest expense decreased by million due to the decrease in earnings of our subsidiaries 
equity in earnings of non consolidated entities decreased million due to a decrease in net income of non consolidated entities  related primarily to increased depreciation 
net income decreased by million primarily due to the impact of items discussed above offset by an increase in total discontinued operations of million 
the total discontinued operations income increase was comprised of an increase in gains on sale of properties of million  an increase in debt satisfaction gains of million  an increase in impairment charges of million and a reduction in income from discontinued operations of million 
net income allocable to common shareholders decreased due to the items discussed 
any increase in net income in future periods will be closely tied to the level of acquisitions made by us 
without acquisitions  which in addition to generating rental revenue  generate acquisition  debt placement and asset management fees when such properties are acquired by joint venture or advisory programs  growth in net income is dependent on index adjusted rents  percentage rents  reduced interest expense on amortizing mortgages and by controlling variable overhead costs 
however  there are many factors beyond management s control that could offset these items including  without limitation  increased interest rates of debt and tenant monetary defaults 
comparison of to changes in the results of our operations are primarily due to the growth of our portfolio and costs associated with such growth 
of the increase in total gross revenues in of million  million is primarily attributable to increases in rental revenue 
the remaining million increase in gross revenues in was attributable to an increase in tenant reimbursements of million and a million increase in advisory fees

net income allocable to common shareholders decreased due to the items discussed above plus by an increase in preferred dividends of million resulting from the issuance of preferred shares in and environmental matters based upon management s ongoing review of our properties  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties  which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that i the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  ii changes in law  iii the conduct of tenants or iv activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties  will not expose us to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of our tenants  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  as amended  which we refer to as sfas  was issued in may sfas establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope 
for us  sfas was effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise was effective as of january   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
sfas has been deferred indefinitely for certain types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
the adoption of the required portions of sfas had no impact on us

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which we refer to as sfas this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and liabilities and certain other items at fair value 
an enterprise will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis  with several exceptions  such as investments accounted for by the equity method  and once elected  the option is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs 
the fair value option can be applied only to entire instruments and not to portions thereof

 revised share based payment  which we refer to as sfas r  which supersedes accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which we refer to as apb opinion no 
 and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period in which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas r was effective for fiscal years beginning after january  the impact of adopting this statement resulted in the elimination of million of deferred compensation and additional paid in capital from the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity

 exchange of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which we refer to as sfas the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas amends apb opinion no
