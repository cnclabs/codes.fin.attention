the company s products are used in hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers  physicians offices and patients homes 
revenue from the oncology infusion services market is generated by infusystem  inc infusystem  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
on september   the company signed a definitive agreement to sell infusystem to hapc  inc hapc for million in the form of cash and a secured note  subject to certain price adjustments based on the level of working capital 
the cash portion of the purchase price will range from to million  depending on the amount hapc pays to its shareholders who choose to convert their hapc shares into cash 
this amount will not be known until the closing of the transaction 
the closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions and approval by shareholders of hapc  and currently is expected to close in the second quarter of however  no assurance can be given that the transaction will close 
the company s current strategic focus for future growth is on the rapidly growing regional anesthesia market  with particular emphasis on the company s pain relief products marketed under its on q brand 
the company intends to continue its sales and marketing efforts to further penetrate the united states post surgical pain relief market with its on q products 
discontinued operations of infusystem as noted above  the company signed a definitive agreement in september to sell infusystem to hapc for million in the form of cash and a secured note  subject to certain price adjustments based on the level of working capital 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we have reclassified the results of infusystem as discontinued operations  reclassifying previously reported results to reflect all prior periods on a comparable basis 
summarized financial information for infusystem is as follows year ended december  amounts in thousands operating revenues operating income income taxes income from discontinued operations includes  of divestiture expenses recorded during the year ended december  if consummated  the sale of infusystem will decrease the company s operating revenues and increase operating loss on a going forward basis 
as a result  the company expects future cash flows from operating activities to decrease overall 
for the year ended december   cash flows from infusystem s operating activities provided million 
the company expects the decrease in cash flows from operating activities to be partially offset by an increase in interest income from the investment of cash proceeds and from an anticipated secured promissory note payable to the company by hapc upon the completion of the transaction 
cash flow from investing activities is expected to increase due to less spending on property acquisitions and an increase in short term investments from the proceeds from the sale of infusystem

consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue net product sales from continuing operations increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  management has chosen to organize the enterprise around differences in products and services  which is the level at which the company s management regularly reviews operating results to make decisions about resource allocation and segment performance 
the company s products are predominately assembled from common subassembly components in a single integrated manufacturing facility  and operating results are reviewed by management on a combined basis including all products as opposed to several operating segments 
the company believes it is most meaningful for the purposes of revenue analyses  however  to group the product lines into two categories representing specific clinical applications regional anesthesia and iv infusion therapy 
regional anesthesia product revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased clinical usage of the on q painbuster post operative pain relief system and c bloc continuous nerve block system by surgeons in the united states and an increase of in the average selling price during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase in average selling price was due to a favorable shift in the product mix towards products with higher average selling prices  such as the c bloc continuous nerve block system 
revenue from the c bloc continuous nerve block system increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  primarily due to improved customer awareness of clinical efficacy and favorable reimbursement from third parties 
other regional anesthesia products include the soaker catheter and the silversoaker tm catheter  which was introduced at the beginning of sales of iv infusion therapy products  which include the company s intravenous elastomeric pumps  mechanical infusion devices and disposables  increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from increased unit sales of iv infusion therapy products to us and international distributors  including b 
braun medical inc in the united states and b

braun medical sa  a manufacturer and distributor of pharmaceuticals and infusion products  to distribute the company s elastomeric infusion pumps in western europe  eastern europe  the middle east  asia pacific  south america and africa 
cost of revenues cost of revenues from continuing operations increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million 
the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume

selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses from continuing operations increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in commissions million  compensation and related expenses million  travel and entertainment expenses million  marketing samples million and non cash compensation expense related to the amortization of deferred compensation million  partially offset by a decrease of million in advertising and promotions expense 
as reflected above  the increases in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were primarily due to costs related to the realignment and expansion of the company s direct sales force in the united states 
in a transaction that was effective as of january   i flow re acquired from ethicon endo surgery  inc the contractual rights to distribute on q products on a direct basis 
since that time  on q revenues have increased rapidly  and the company s primary strategy in the regional anesthesia market has been to rapidly increase market awareness of the clinical and economic advantages of on q technology through a combination of clinical studies  sales force expansion and marketing programs 
the increases in commissions  compensation and related expenses  travel and entertainment expenses and marketing samples were directly related to the increase in revenue  an increase in the number of quota carrying sales representatives  and changes in the company s direct sales force and sales management

the company recognized stock based compensation costs related to selling and marketing expenses of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  in fiscal did not have a significant impact on stock based compensation expense for selling and marketing expenses because the company was required to recognize such expenses under the prior accounting guidance for the stock awards issued to the sales force since they were generally granted with an exercise price below fair market value 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling and marketing expenses decreased by approximately for the year ended december  versus the prior year because net revenues increased at a rate that outpaced the increase in selling and marketing expenses described above 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in non cash compensation expense related to the amortization of deferred compensation million and legal fees million  partially offset by increases in compensation and related expenses million and insurance expense million 
the decrease in non cash compensation expense related to the amortization of deferred compensation was primarily due to the upward repricing and acceleration of the out of the money stock options on november   offset in part by the adoption of sfas r in fiscal the primary purposes of upward repricing and acceleration of the out of the money stock options were to comply with new deferred compensation tax laws  to promote employee motivation  retention and the perception of option value and to avoid recognizing future compensation expense associated with out of the money stock options upon adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all equity based compensation  including unvested stock options previously granted to employees at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying shares at the grant date 
the company recognized stock based compensation costs related to general and administrative expenses of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively

income taxes income tax benefit from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  was due to a release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets with an incremental tax benefit of approximately million 
the remaining valuation allowance relates to temporary timing differences that are not currently determined to be more likely than not to be realized 
the income tax benefit was consistent with the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which addresses financial accounting for deferred tax assets 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not  based on available evidence  that projected future taxable income will be insufficient to recover the deferred tax assets 
due to the pending sale of infusystem to hapc  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of the existing net deferred tax asset at december  in the event the company is unable to operate at a profit and unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  it would be required to increase the valuation allowance against all of its deferred tax assets 
i flow  in the design and improvement of its products  incurs research and development costs that qualify for federal and state tax credits 
an increase in credits occurred during the current year due to an additional analysis regarding the expenses that qualify for state and federal research and development credits

 recognition of deferred tax assets for a parent company s excess tax basis in the stock of a subsidiary that is accounted for as a discontinued operation eitf

critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  the company is required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that the company believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the critical accounting policies that the company believes are the most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title  when evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company offers the right of return for defective products and continuously monitors and tracks product returns 
the company records a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
although returns have historically been insignificant  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates as it has in the past 
any significant increase in product returns could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which the returns materialize 
the company does not recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment and passage of title has occurred  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes rental revenues  which is recorded in discontinued operations  from medical pumps over the term of the related agreement  generally on a month to month basis 
pump rentals are billed at the company s established rates  which often significantly differ from contractually allowable rates provided by third party payors such as medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance carriers 
the company records net rental revenues at the estimated realizable amounts from patients and third party payors 
the company experiences significant delays in payment with certain of these third party payors  but it continuously monitors reimbursement rates of the third party payors and the timing of such payments 
any change in reimbursement or collection rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which the change is identified 
accounts receivable the company performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances 
it records an allowance for bad debts based on the estimated collectibility of the accounts such that the recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
the company applies specified percentages to the accounts receivable agings to estimate the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible and therefore should be reserved 
the percentages are increased as the accounts age 
if the actual uncollected amounts are less than the previously estimated allowance  a favorable adjustment would result 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly and adversely affected 
inventories the company values inventory on a part by part basis at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out basis and the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory on specifically identified items based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next two years 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and thus the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company seeks to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and reported operating results 
deferred taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
the company also established a deferred tax liability on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with eitf eitf requires that the deferred tax impact of the excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of the parent s investment in a subsidiary be recognized when it is apparent that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future 
in accordance with eitf  the company recorded an adjustment to discontinued operations for the tax effect of the financial reporting basis in the stock of infusystem which exceeds the tax basis 
this difference and related deferred tax liabilities associated with discontinued operations will be settled upon closing of the sale of infusystem to hapc 
stock based compensation beginning january   the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period
