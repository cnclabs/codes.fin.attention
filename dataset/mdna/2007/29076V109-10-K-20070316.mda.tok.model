our web enabled advanced visualization software  which is hosted by the customer  provides physicians across the enterprise in multiple medical specialties and at any network access point with dynamic tools to manipulate and analyze images in both a d perspective and a d perspective 
with these tools  physicians have the ability to better understand internal anatomic structure and pathology  which can improve clinical diagnoses  disease screening and therapy planning 
our open standards based solutions are designed to help customers improve staff productivity  enhance revenue opportunities  automate complex medical imaging workflow  lower total cost of ownership and provide better service to physicians and patients 
our fiscal year ends on december references below to annual periods or years refer to the fiscal years ended december results overview total revenue for was million  representing a increase over the increase was comprised of a increase in system sales revenue and a increase in support services revenue 
our overall gross margin percentage increased from for to for we achieved gross margin percentages of and for system sales and support services revenue  respectively  during  compared to and  respectively  for our net loss was million in compared to a net loss of million in  including million and million  respectively  in acquisition related integration costs in those years 
as of december   we had million in contracted backlog  consisting of fees for contracted future installations and for the support of existing installations  compared with a contracted backlog of million at december  we expect to recognize revenue from our current backlog of approximately million in and million in substantially all of the remaining million  which primarily consists of recurring revenue from support services  is expected to be recognized by our backlog will generally decrease as we recognize revenue under existing contracts  and it will increase as we enter into new contracts 
however  our order and revenue patterns increasingly consist of relatively shorter periods between initial order and completion of installation  particularly for add on orders from existing customers and  as a result  annually reported contracted backlog figures may not accurately portray historical or prospective sales activity levels 
initial public offering and camtronics integration on february   we completed our initial public offering of common stock 
we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
on february   our underwriters exercised the over allotment option to purchase  additional shares at a price of per share 
total proceeds from the initial public offering  net of underwriting discount and offering expenses  were million 
at december   we had  shares of common stock issued   shares of common stock outstanding  and  warrants to purchase shares of our common stock outstanding at an exercise price of per share 
on november   we acquired all the stock of camtronics medical systems  ltd  based in hartland  wisconsin  for million in cash 
as of december   we have completed the integration of camtronics into the company 

table of contents our market we believe the health information technology market is exhibiting the following trends increasing procedure volumes increasing procedure size modality blending  a layering of studies from two separate modalities for diagnostic and treatment purposes expanding adoption and use of standards increasing emphasis by payors  healthcare providers  and government agencies on electronic health record integration body transparency  a new paradigm for navigating through large volumes of information the amount of imaging data being generated by health care providers is growing extremely rapidly 
this data must be stored and made available for easy retrieval 
increasingly  health care information users want access to the stored data at any time  and in any location 
in addition  modalities that provide non invasive alternatives continue to expand into other clinical domains 
examples include mr and ct angiography multi detector ct for heart and chest imaging ct pet fusion cardiac catheterization one area that has received significant attention is advanced visualization  which uses d and other advanced analytic tools as key elements in an enterprise visual medical system 
earlier generation pacs have focused primarily on single departments and have utilized generic d tools 
a complete enterprise visualization system must not only support full d capabilities  but also include d tools  integrate easily into other information systems  and adhere to standards 
to understand these images  referring physicians need tools that adapt to their specialty 
our solutions can be extended to multiple stakeholders throughout the health care enterprise 
our solutions go beyond moving images from point a to point b to effectively distributing multi specialty tools and clinical content using a web enabled platform 
our solutions not only manage very complex datasets  but also perform advanced visualization such as d reconstruction and analysis within the viewing application  and distribute essential clinical tools through the network 
significant events in during the year ended december   we continued to focus on our core set of strategic goals 
we believe the following events were significant with respect to our goals we successfully completed the integration of camtronics into our business  including integration of the management structure and sales force  commencement of cross selling efforts  consolidation of the engineering staff  and consolidation of the administrative function including financial systems 

table of contents in november  we entered into strategic relationships with vital images  inc and allscripts healthcare solutions allowing us to offer the complementary products of those companies with our products across our installed base of customers 
we expanded our customer relationships to now encompass medical facilities  of which have installed our products 
we achieved record bookings and revenue  improved our gross margins  reduced our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  and generated positive operating cash flow while avoiding the incurrence of debt 
sources of revenue a typical sale of our solution is comprised of system sales and support services 
revenue from system sales is derived from the licensing of our advanced visualization  clinical content management  and clinical workflow for radsuite and heartsuite collectively referred to as our enterprise visual medical system  or evms  as well as from sales and integration of third party components that are required to implement our solution 
support services revenue is derived from fees related to the implementation  training and on going customer support of our solution 
our software is comprised of four main components radsuite advanced visualization  our suite of software tools for the advanced visualization and analysis of digital medical images  clinical content management  our image archival and distribution management software  clinical workflow  our standards based software used to manage integration and data migration between our solution and other health information systems throughout the enterprise  and heartsuite  our suite of software tools focused on the cardiology department 
although clinical content management and heartsuite software products are available collectively as stand alone applications  we offer our software primarily as an integrated enterprise level image management solution 
license pricing for radsuite advanced visualization is primarily determined by either the number of licenses based on the number of concurrent users or on the average annual study volume 
license pricing for clinical content management and clinical workflow is determined based on projected volume and size of image studies to be stored or migrated by the particular customer 
license pricing for heartsuite software products is determined based on the number of workstations purchased 
we offer customers our software as perpetual or term licenses  in either case with maintenance and support relating to the software 
term licenses for our software are typically from two to ten years with annual renewals after the initial term 
the sale and integration of third party components typically include servers  data storage  backup and recovery systems  workstations and monitors  database software and computed radiography devices as well as orthopedic templates and dictation systems 
we also derive revenue from the provision of support services  including implementation  project planning  management  design and training services 
our customers typically contract for these support services pursuant to their initial agreements with us 
the initial term of these support services under these agreements range from one to ten years  with a typical duration of five years 
upon expiration of the initial term  these agreements typically renew automatically from year to year thereafter until terminated 
ascension health  the largest not for profit hospital system in the united states  is our largest customer 
revenue associated with facilities controlled by ascension health accounted for approximately of both our total revenue during and our total contracted backlog at december  we anticipate that ascension health will continue to be a significant customer as we continue to support our existing installations as well as sign add on orders and new order addenda with additional ascension health facilities 
cost of revenue the cost of system sales consists of the cost of third party components and the cost of software licenses 
the cost of our third party components consists primarily of direct and indirect expenses related to the purchase  manufacturing  shipment  installation and configuration of our solutions 
the cost of our software licenses consists 
table of contents primarily of the amortization of acquired software and the amortization of capitalized software costs for internally developed software 
the cost of our support services consists primarily of labor costs and overhead relating to the implementation  installation  training  application support and maintenance of our solution as well as costs related to maintenance of third party components 
the cost of support services revenue varies based upon the productivity of our support services organization as well as costs associated with the use of outside contractors to support internal resources 
gross profit our overall gross profit has improved due to an increase in the software content of our system sales and in recurring support services revenue derived from our growing installed base of customers 
gross profit from system sales varies based on several factors  including actual sales prices negotiated in the contracting process  costs associated with purchasing and manufacturing third party components  fluctuations in prices received from third party component manufacturers and distributors relative to the mark up percentages provided for in customer contracts  and the relative mix of the hardware and software components comprising system sales in a given period 
gross profit from support services varies based on several factors  including actual services fees negotiated during the contracting process  productivity of our professional service team  costs of service agreements related to third party components included in our solution  and costs associated with the use of outside contractors 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  allocated overhead  and the costs of outside contractors 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on improving the functionality  performance  and integration of our software products 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase as we strive to introduce additional products and services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including travel  marketing programs  allocated overhead and sales commissions 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our selling and marketing activities associated with existing and new product and service offerings to existing and new customers  and build brand awareness 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and administrative costs related to the growth of our business and operations  including additional compliance costs in connection with public company corporate governance and financial reporting requirements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of aicpa statement of position  sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  in the application of this standard  we exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of system sales and support services revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
we sell software under three types of licenses perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis to a customer based on a fixed number of users and or estimates of annual study volumes with no right to return the licensed software 
enterprise licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis to a customer typically a multi facility health care provider  as opposed to licensing based on a fixed number of users or on estimates of annual study volumes  with no right to return the licensed software 
term licenses software licensed on a term basis according to a fixed number of users and or estimates of annual study volumes 
generally  our software license arrangements do not include significant modification or customization of the underlying software and  as a result  we recognize license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we assess each of the four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement  prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred it is our customary practice to obtain acceptance for our software  which is evidenced by written customer acknowledgement 
in the event that we grant a customer the right to specified upgrades  we defer recognition of the entire arrangement fee until we deliver the specified upgrades as we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for specified upgrades 
specified upgrades include  but are not limited to  future software deliverables that are stated in the customer contract 
the customer s payment is deemed fixed or determinable we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties at the time of sale and recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amounts become due and payable 
collection is probable likelihood of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement or at the time of add on sales to existing customers that 
table of contents collection is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis if all other criteria are met 
we account for software license and non recurring support services revenue included in multiple element arrangements using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements ie  software maintenance and ongoing support services based on vsoe of fair value is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie  software license and non recurring support services 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those services occurs or fair value can be established 
we determine vsoe of fair value for ongoing support services revenue based upon the renewal rates for the maintenance and ongoing support  which coincide with our pricing model 
significant incremental discounts offered in multiple element arrangements that would be characterized as separate elements are infrequent and are applied to the initial arrangement 
for term license arrangements  we recognize revenue for the multiple element arrangement over the term of the arrangement beginning in the month after we receive customer acceptance  provided that the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
software maintenance services generally include rights to upgrades when and if available  telephone support  updates and bug fixes 
software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract on a straight line basis when all the revenue recognition requirements are met 
we include the first year of software maintenance in the software license fee 
we defer this software maintenance fee based on its fair value and recognize it ratably over the first year of the arrangement 
ongoing support services generally include telephone support related to third party components 
ongoing support service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the ongoing support services contract on a straight line basis when all the revenue recognition requirements are met 
as it relates to services  we may also provide services that vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the customer 
examples of such services include additional database consulting  system configuration  existing systems interface  and network consulting 
these services generally are not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software 
if we have vsoe of fair value for the services  the timing of the software license revenue is not impacted  and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
we commonly perform services for which we do not have vsoe of fair value and  accordingly  the software license revenue is deferred until the services are completed 
revenue related to product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed and determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
we classify shipping and handling cost in cost of system sales 
third party component revenue  including hardware sales and hardware maintenance  is recognized in accordance with contractual terms 
when we are responsible for installing third party components  revenue is recognized when the third party components are delivered  installed and accepted by the customer 
when we are not responsible for installing the third party components  revenue is recognized when the third party components are delivered to the customer 
when third party components and related maintenance are not separately priced in our contracts  we recognize revenue related to the arrangement when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the following is a summary of our product warranty and guarantee and our related accounting policies for these agreements our sales agreements with customers generally contain infringement indemnity provisions 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with patent  copyright or trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customer s authorized use of our products and services 
our sales agreements with customers sometimes also contain indemnity provisions for death  personal injury or property damage caused by our personnel or contractors in the course of performing services to customers 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with death  personal injury and property damage claims made by third parties with respect to 
table of contents actions of our personnel or contractors 
the indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements generally have no specified expiration date but typically limit the amount of award covered to a portion of the fees paid by the customer over a portion of the contract term 
we have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification provisions 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of december  we warrant that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer as long as the contract remains in effect 
additionally  we warrant that our services will be performed by qualified personnel in a manner consistent with normally accepted industry standards 
we provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
as of december  we have million of liabilities recorded for these agreements 
billings may not coincide with the recognition of revenue 
unbilled revenue  which is included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet  occurs when revenue recognition precedes billing to the customer  and arises primarily from sales with predetermined billing schedules 
billings in excess of sales deferred revenue occur when billing to the customer precedes revenue recognition  and arise primarily from sales with partial prepayments upon contract execution and from maintenance revenue billed in advance of performance of the maintenance activity 
we recognize deferred revenue  as applicable  upon delivery and acceptance of products  as ongoing services are rendered or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
costs related to deferred revenue are included as an asset in our consolidated balance sheet and charged to expense when the related deferred revenue is recognized 
the timing of customer acceptances could significantly affect our results of operations during a given period 
as noted above  we require written acknowledgement from the customer to evidence that delivery of the products or services has occurred 
delays in the implementation process could negatively affect operations in a given period by increasing volatility in revenue recognition 
research and development costs 
research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
however  costs incurred for the development of software that will be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized as incurred after technological feasibility has been established and capitalization ceases when the software is generally available for release 
judgment is involved in determining when technological feasibility is reached 
we believe that technological feasibility is reached when we have completed a working model that is ready to be beta tested at a customer site 
these capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenue and changes in technologies 
costs deemed not recoverable are charged to expense 
costs that are capitalized primarily consist of direct labor 
amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when the product is available for general release 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis using the straight line method over periods not exceeding three years 
intangible and other long lived assets 
us generally accepted accounting principles require the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations after june   and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separate from goodwill 
accordingly  we identify and allocate values to intangible assets based on discounted cash flow analyses and market research  as well as our judgment 
intangibles determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually 
we evaluate intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and also if and when impairment indicators are identified 
in assessing the recoverability of intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenue  which is inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
property  equipment and intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives of the intangible assets are based on management s estimates of the periods over which such assets will generate revenue 

table of contents results of operations revenue individual radiology system sales typically are larger in terms of both sales dollars and implementation time than individual cardiology system sales 
in any given period  the mix of total system sales revenue to total support services revenue  the mix of hardware to software comprising system sales revenue  and the mix of radiology revenue to cardiology revenue can produce significant variability in the levels of revenue and gross margin reported 
the following table sets forth revenue component data 
year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages system sales support services total revenue revenue for was million  a increase over revenue of million and a increase over revenue for the year ended december  these increases reflect both the organic growth of our products and the results of our acquisition of camtronics and its cardiology line of products on november  excluding cardiology products acquired with the camtronics acquisition  our revenue grew by in system sales revenue for was million  a increase over systems sales revenue of million 
as described above  the acquisition of camtronics on november  was a contributing factor in our system sales revenue growth  but our system sales excluding cardiology products grew as well  by approximately in this growth was the result of greater numbers of systems installations for both existing and new customers  and of greater acceptance of our products in the marketplace  particularly with multi facility health care providers 
growth in our radiology line of products was driven in equal parts by increased sales of software and third party components  with our sales of software licenses particularly strong with existing customers 
the increase in system sales revenue from to was attributable to an increase in the number of new and existing customer installations offset by a decrease in the size of these installations  as well as the recognition of million of revenue deferred in and recognized in during  we had more acceptances of our software and third party components than in the average revenue recognized per acceptance decreased slightly in as compared to  the result primarily of an increase in add on sales to our existing customer base  which tend to be smaller than initial sales to new customers 
also during  we recognized system sales revenue of million related to two contracts for which we deferred revenue in as a result of the existence of certain undelivered upgrades 
we delivered the additional software features during and recognized the system sales revenue associated with these contracts 
support services revenue grew by to million in from its level of million 
as described above  our acquisition of camtronics on november  was a contributing factor in our support services revenue growth  but our legacy service offerings grew as well  by in to over million 
both the professional services and system maintenance components of support services revenue grew substantially in support services revenue is ancillary to system sales revenue and therefore tends to grow as system sales revenue grows  as new or add on system installations are completed and as more customers subscribe to our maintenance services 
the increase in support services revenue from to was attributable to an increase in customer installations 
approximately million of the increase in support services revenue for was attributable to an increased number of customers that implemented our solution and pay us ongoing support and maintenance fees 
also included in this million increase is the recognition of million of revenue related to the contracts mentioned above for which we deferred revenue in as a result of the existence of undelivered upgrades 
we delivered the additional software features during and recognized the support services revenue attributable to 
table of contents the previously provided services for which we had deferred support services revenue 
the remaining million increase was related to an increase in non recurring revenue related to services such as implementation and training for new customers as well as add on services for existing customers 
gross margin the following table sets forth gross margin earned on revenues for the three years in the period ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue system sales support services total cost of revenue system sales support services total gross profit system sales support services total gross margin system sales support services total system sales gross margin was in compared to in  a decline of margin points 
this decline in system sales margin is related primarily to our acquisition of camtronics on november  and the inclusion of a full twelve months of cardiology product line revenue and costs in our revenue and gross margin in cardiology products in general earn slightly lower gross margins than radiology products  and the mix of cardiology to radiology revenue in a given period can affect the level of total gross margin reported 
this lower cardiology margin for the year met our initial expectations  though these margins were lower in the first half of due to one time acquisition accounting adjustments to revenue deferred by camtronics prior to the acquisition 
additionally  our gross margin on the third party components of radiology system sales was approximately two margin points lower in than in due primarily to pricing considerations 
gross margin earned on the software component of radiology system revenue was flat with as a percentage of software revenue  and the relative mix of the hardware and software components of radiology revenue was approximately the same in as in in general  the cost of third party hardware components tends to lower our system sales gross margin 
we expect system sales gross margins on an annual basis in the mid forty percent range going forward  assuming a normal mix of hardware to software and radiology to cardiology system sales revenue 
however  we also expect a continuation of price competition in our industry  which could act to lower our system margins  and we expect fluctuation in the system sales margins we earn quarter to quarter depending on the mix of system sales revenue recognized in given reporting periods 

table of contents system sales gross margin was in compared to in  an increase of margin points 
this increase is related to an increase in the software content of system sales in compared to in addition  gross margin earned on the software component of system sales was higher in compared to system sales gross margin in was further increased relative to by recognition of million in revenue in that had been deferred in due to the timing of recognition of this revenue  minimal associated costs were recognized in the overall increase in system sales gross margin in was limited somewhat by inclusion in the statement of operations of the revenue and costs of camtronics for the two month period following its acquisition support services gross margin was in  an increase of margin points over the margin of 
support services revenue consists primarily of professional services  which accounts for the majority of support services revenue  and of maintenance revenue from our customers who subscribe to our ongoing maintenance services 
professional services revenue is ancillary to systems sales revenue  and thus will grow as the number of new system installations or system additions grows  and maintenance revenue will grow as the number of our customers who subscribe to our maintenance services increases 
both forms of revenue can provide significant leverage with respect to margins earned since the costs of both forms of revenue consist largely of labor and associated costs that are primarily fixed in nature 
in  we benefited substantially from this leverage  as the investments made in prior years in support services headcount and technology were spread over an increasing base of revenue providing customers in both the professional services and maintenance areas  and as that labor force increased its efficiencies in service activities 
correspondingly  support services revenue in earned a much lower gross margin as our increased investments in employees and technology had just been made and we had a smaller installed base of customers 
in addition  we benefited from inclusion of a full twelve months of cardiology support services revenue in  as cardiology support services typically earn a slightly higher gross margin than radiology support services 
the timing of completion of individual system sales installations can significantly impact the level of support services revenue and gross margin from period to period 
with our current mix of business  we expect support services gross margin on an annual basis slightly in excess of our system sales gross margin  assuming continuing efficiencies from our support staff and assuming the cardiology business continues to deliver support services gross margin at the present level  but we also expect some level of timing based variability in the level of support services gross margin reported from period to period 
support services gross margin was in compared to in the increase in support services revenue between these periods of was the primary contributing factor in the gross margin increase as  due to the nature of support services costs  increases in support services revenue do not bring corresponding increases in costs 
as discussed above  the costs of support services are primarily labor oriented and fixed in nature 
these costs were spread over an expanding base of customer installations in both and  yielding a pattern of increasing support services gross margin over the three year period ended in in addition  we believe that the efficiencies of our support staff increased as we invested in training and technology and that those investments should further enhance our support services gross margin 
research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses total research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the corresponding prior year period  an increase of million  or 
the addition of the operating expenses of camtronics  which was acquired november   accounts for the majority of the total increase  with the remainder consisting of increased general and administrative expenses resulting from additional compliance costs related to public company financial reporting requirements  specifically the costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley  stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  and 
table of contents increased costs of personnel and overhead expenses consistent with our growth and expanded development  selling and marketing efforts and related supporting administrative costs 
the growth of in these expenses in compares to total revenue growth over the same period of and growth in gross profit of 
as a percentage of revenue  these expenses in total declined to in compared to in as a result of revenue growth and our efforts to limit the rate of increase in our operating expenses 
we expect that our research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses will continue to grow as revenue grows and as we address new products and markets  but we do not expect this growth to exceed the rate of revenue growth over the long term 
research and development r d expense year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages r d expense of revenue the increase in research and development expense in compared to of million  or  is almost entirely the net result of the acquisition of camtronics on november  and the inclusion of the former camtronics r d expenses in our financial statements for a full twelve month period in increased r d expense resulting from the camtronics acquisition aside  the level of increase in r d expense in was minimized by a decline in direct r d headcount and related expenses and in the number of operations personnel performing r d activities as the result of the consolidation of engineering staffs between the companies and the efficiencies that resulted from that consolidation 
offsetting the effects of the decline in headcount were increased r d overhead expenses  primarily depreciation  related to the upgrade of r d laboratory facilities during and the physical consolidation of r d facilities into a single location in  and increased stock based compensation expense recognized in as the result of initial adoption of sfas no 
r 
a portion of r d spending is focused on use of lower cost consultants engaged in quality development and on consultants and developers that assist our personnel in product quality assurance and validation  and system framework implementations 
we anticipate that use of outside consultants for these activities will continue in the future 
the increase in r d expense in compared to of million  or  is the result of the acquisition of camtronics on november   which added approximately million to expense  and of increased r d headcount and related expenses unrelated and prior to the acquisition of camtronics of approximately million incurred in acceleration of product development efforts 
in addition  spending on outside consultants increased by million in compared to in support of these same efforts 
sales and marketing expense year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages s m expense of revenue 
table of contents the increase in sales and marketing expense in compared to of million  or  is largely the result of the acquisition of camtronics on november  and the reflection in the financial statements of a full twelve months of the former camtronics sales and marketing expenses  and related cross training of the sales staffs and cross selling activities between the radiology and cardiology product lines 
increased sales and marketing expenses in are  however  also the result of our planned and executed efforts to extend our product base to existing and prospective customers and to increase awareness of our products in the marketplace 
accordingly  expenses were approximately million higher in than in in the combined areas of advertising  targeted marketing and market research  customer relations  and trade show attendance and related expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense under sfasr added approximately million to sales and marketing expense 
offsetting these increases were declines in personnel and related expenses reflecting a slight decline in sales and marketing headcount in  and in commissions expense  which declined despite increased revenue as the result of a higher percentage of sales to existing customers  which result in lower commission percentage than sales to new customers  and the effects of timing of the earning of commissions and of differences in the types of sales closed and installed in compared to sales commissions are earned based on achievement of various milestones in completion of individual sales  including customer payment  and are recorded as expense over the period earned 
the increase in sales and marketing expense of million  or  in compared to relates primarily to headcount in the sales and marketing area  which more than doubled in including personnel acquired with the camtronics acquisition  and to headcount related expenses such as travel and training 
specific sales and marketing employee groups augmented in include our client sales group  which is engaged in support and development of large hospital and hospital network customers  and our marketing support group  which is engaged in product demonstration and product marketing 
viewed separately  the acquisition of camtronics added approximately million to sales and marketing expense 
the level of commissions expense was relatively stable in compared to the level 
we believe that all of the efforts discussed above have heightened our reputation in the marketplace and should help deliver continued revenue growth in the future 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we address new customers and new markets 
general and administrative expense year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages g a expense of revenue as we expected  our general and administrative expense has grown significantly in absolute terms over the three year period ended december  this growth is in support of our growth in revenue over the three year period and is also the result of our becoming a publicly held company in february   our acquisition of camtronics in november   and additional compliance costs related to public company financial reporting requirements  specifically compliance with aspects of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in general and administrative expense of million  or  in compared to is the result of the acquisition of camtronics on november  and resulting inclusion of a full twelve months of camtronics general and administrative expense in our financial statements  of our compliance with sarbanes oxley  of stock based compensation expense  and of our growth in revenue over the period 
our general and administrative staff was augmented in  adding personnel and personnel related expense of approximately million in support of our increased base of employees and public company obligations 
in addition and for the same reasons  our insurance  property taxes and similar expenses grew significantly in the most significant increases in expense in compared to were our professional and consulting fees and related expenses incurred in connection with sarbanes oxley compliance approximately million  and our recognition of stock 
table of contents based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r of approximately million in excess of the level 
the increase in general and administrative expense in compared to of million  or  consisted of the addition of the november and december expenses of camtronics of million  increased insurance  legal  professional  and consulting fees and expenses of million  largely as the result of becoming a publicly held company in february  increased stock based compensation compared to of million  and an increase in administrative headcount and related expenses in support of our growth and public company status 
we expect our general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms in support of our continued growth  but at a rate of growth less than that of our other operating expenses and revenue 
amortization of intangible assets related to camtronics acquisition amortization expense related to the acquisition of camtronics consists of straight line amortization of the intangible assets acquired with camtronics over periods of one to six years 
the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets are determined based on projected future economic benefits and expected life cycles of the intangible assets 
integration costs related to camtronics acquisition we incurred integration costs of million in as a result of the november acquisition of camtronics million in november and december 
integration costs are comprised primarily of employee costs including travel and relocation expenses  severance and related expenses of terminated employees  and the costs of facility closure 
we believe that camtronics has been fully integrated into our business as of december  operating income loss for the year ended december   operating loss increased by million as compared to the year ended december   as the benefits of significantly improved revenue and gross margin in were offset by the incurrence of million in costs related to the integration of camtronics into our business 
excluding the impact of those integration costs  operating loss improved to million in from million in and million in other income and expense for the year ended december   interest income and interest expense declined from the prior year by million and million  respectively  as a result of the decline in short term investment balances from their peak at completion of the initial public offering in february and the payment of scheduled maturities of debt and capital lease obligations during for the year ended december   interest expense increased by million as compared to primarily as a result of a non cash interest charge of million for the write off of subordinated debt discount  offset by a reduction in interest expense from repayment of million of subordinated debt with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for the eight most recent quarters 
the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this filing and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for such periods 
this data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this filing

in addition  in the quarter ended december   we made several adjustments to correct amounts recorded in prior quarters 
the amounts were not material to any quarter 
revenue 
in the past  we have at times experienced lower bookings volume in the third quarter of each year relative to other quarters 
we believe that this is the result of the historical capital expenditure patterns of our customer base 
this  in turn  may cause our revenue in the first quarter of the following year to be lower in comparison to the immediately preceding quarter due to the length of our installations and our revenue recognition policies 
gross margin 
our gross margin fluctuates from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in the relative contributions to our total revenue from system sales and support services  the mix of the hardware and software 
table of contents components of systems sales revenue  the mix of cardiology revenue to radiology revenue  and changes in the productivity of support services personnel 
operating expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate due to the timing of sales and of individual marketing programs 
also  the most significant trade show that we attend occurs within the fourth quarter of each year  increasing our sales and marketing expenses in that quarter 
some important additional factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include expenses incurred as a direct result of our acquisitions of other businesses  such as our acquisition of camtronics in the fourth quarter of  length of the sales cycle or implementation time for our solutions  changes in our pricing policies  new product introductions and product enhancements by us or our competitors  technical difficulties or downtime in our solutions  and regulatory compliance costs 
significant changes in the historical patterns of these factors or the occurrence of unforeseen events could cause our operating results to vary widely from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  our net cash position was as follows in thousands  except ratios december working capital current ratio cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities short term borrowings and long term debt working capital is total current assets less total current liabilities 
current ratio is the ratio of current assets to current liabilities 
the improvement in our liquidity during was due to increased cash provided by operating activities through the year  but particularly in the fourth quarter of the year 
the decrease in short term borrowings and long term debt from december  to december  is a result of scheduled debt retirement 
operating activities during the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million  representing an improvement of million over cash used in operations in the improvement was due primarily to improved operations 
in addition  year to year changes in the levels of cash required to maintain accounts receivable and inventories improved our cash position by million  which was offset by a decline in cash required for accounts payable of million 
our working capital is affected by the volume of operations from time to time  which can affect our point in time investments in accounts receivable and inventories  by the timing of payments of our trade liabilities and the receipt of payment from our customers  and by the timing of receipt of acceptances of third party components at our customers sites 
during the year ended december   cash used in operations was million  which primarily related to our net loss of million and changes in working capital accounts 
we experienced significant increases in trade accounts receivable and inventory to be sold to customers during the year 
our accounts receivable balance increased as a result of the timing of customer acceptances as well as the timing of new customer contracts 
our inventory increased as a result of the timing of acceptances of third party components at customer sites 
the 
table of contents changes in other working capital accounts were primarily driven by increased volume of operations and the timing of cash payments 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million  which consisted of an increase of million from changes in working capital accounts and a decrease of million as a result of our net loss offset by non cash items 
changes in the working capital accounts primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable  an increase in prepaid expenses  an increase in inventory  increases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses and an increase in deferred revenue due to an increased customer base and timing of customer payments 
the changes in working capital accounts were primarily driven by increased volume of operations and the timing of cash payments 
investing activities we used cash of million  million and million for investing activities during  and  respectively 
we used million  million and million for property and equipment purchases during  and  respectively 
the purchases for and related to investments in equipment for internal use  including test equipment for our research and development and quality assurance departments as well as computer equipment and furniture for new and existing personnel  and to improvements to the building we own in hartland  wisconsin 
approximately million of the purchases for related to computer equipment for new and existing personnel 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment for internal use  consistent with our growth  development efforts  and staffing levels 
we also invested in equipment located at contracted customer sites in and in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
in november  we used million to acquire all the stock of camtronics 
we used million for the purchase of marketable securities and received proceeds of million upon the maturity or sale of some of these securities during the marketable securities consisted of us government agency obligations and corporate commercial paper  all with maturities of less than one year 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in consisted of million in proceeds from issuance of common stock on the exercise of employee stock options  offset by the payment of scheduled debt and lease obligations of million 
cash provided by financing activities for resulted primarily from the completion of our initial public offering 
this inflow of cash was offset by repayment of our million subordinated debt and other payments on borrowings 
cash provided by financing activities for resulted from proceeds from the issuance of subordinated debt of million  which was repaid in upon completion of our initial public offering  offset by payments on existing borrowings and an addition to restricted cash used to secure a letter of credit for an operating lease 
the following table summarizes  as of december   the general timing of future payments including payments of interest under our outstanding loan agreements and capital and operating lease agreements payment due by period in thousands less than more than contractual cash obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt  including interest capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents our april loan and security agreement with a bank  as amended in april   provides for borrowing of up to million  subject to certain restrictions 
interest accrues at the bank s prime rate of interest 
this agreement is for a term of two years  at the end of which all amounts borrowed become due and payable 
security for any amounts borrowed under the agreement consists of all assets of the company other than our intellectual property and real estate 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding balances under this line of credit 
we believe our existing cash  together with future cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our loan and security agreement  if necessary  will be sufficient to execute our business plan in however  any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and services  enhancements to existing products and services  the amount and form of consideration we may issue in acquisition or similar transactions  and the continuing market acceptance of our solution 
to the extent that our existing cash  together with future cash flows from operations and availability under our loan and security agreement are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any binding agreement or letter of intent with respect to any other potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
it is possible that additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into for ordinary business purposes  we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  or with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb its interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this pronouncement  which is effective and will be adopted by us january   prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we are currently evaluating this pronouncement and its application to the company  but do not believe this pronouncement will have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in september   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements 
this pronouncement  which is effective for our fiscal year ending december   defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands financial statement disclosure of fair value measurements 
we are currently evaluating this pronouncement to determine any effects on our reported financial position and results of operations  but we do not currently believe this pronouncement will have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt instruments do not expose us to material market risks relating to changes in interest rates 
some of the proceeds of our initial public offering were invested in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities pending their application 
the value of these securities will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise 
the effect of a hypothetical one hundred basis point decrease across all interest rates related to our investments would result in an annual decrease of approximately million in operating results assuming no further changes in the amount of our investments outstanding at december  
table of contents the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
we invest excess cash principally in us marketable debt securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  or in money market mutual funds that invest in such instruments  and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
these investments are generally not collateralized and mature in less than one year 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus reducing the need to sell or redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments
