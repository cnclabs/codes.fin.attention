item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for unmet medical needs  with an emphasis on oncology and inflammatory indications 
we use our proprietary drug discovery technology  known as phage display  to identify antibody  small protein and peptide compounds for clinical development 
our lead product candidate  dx ecallantide  is a recombinant form of a small protein that is currently in clinical trials for its therapeutic potential in two separate indications 
the first such indication involves the use of dx in the treatment of hereditary angioedema hae 
in this indication  we have successfully completed three phase ii trials and  in november  we treated our last patient in a phase iii trial  known as edema additionally  we plan to initiate a confirmatory trial  known as edema  starting in the first quarter of dx has orphan drug designation in the us and eu  as well as fast track designation in the eu for the treatment of acute attacks of hae 
in the second indication for dx  we have successfully completed a phase i ii trial for the prevention of blood loss during on pump coronary artery bypass graft  or cabg surgery 
dyax has also initiated a phase ii trial for further development of dx in patients undergoing what is more broadly defined as on pump cardiothoracic surgery  or on pump cts  which includes on pump cabg surgery and heart valve replacement and repair procedures 
in addition to our clinical stage programs  we have other product candidates in our discovery and development pipeline  two of which are currently in preclinical development 
the most advanced of these product candidates is dx  a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the tie receptor  a protein receptor that we believe is important in the process of blood vessel formation known as angiogenesis 
dx offers a novel mechanism of action for inhibiting tumor growth  which we believe may have potential application in the treatment of various types of cancer 
all of the compounds in our pipeline were discovered using our proprietary phage display technology which rapidly generates product candidates that bind with high affinity and specificity to therapeutic targets 
although we use this technology primarily to advance our own internal development activities  we also leverage it broadly through licenses and collaborations so that other biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies can use the technology to discover and develop biopharmaceutical leads 
through this program  which we refer to as our licensing and funded research program lfrp  we maintain more than revenue generating licenses and collaborations 
under the lfrp  our licensees and collaborators have product candidates in clinical trials that were generated from our technology and we estimate that over additional product candidates are in various stages of discovery research 
we are entitled to receive milestones and or royalties from our licensees and collaborators to the extent that any of these product candidates advance in development and are ultimately commercialized 
during  we monetized and sold a portion of the future revenues generated through the lfrp to an affiliate of paul capital partners for million in upfront cash with an option for an additional million if the lfrp achieves specified revenue levels by the end of our business strategy is to build a broad portfolio of biotherapeutic products developed using our proprietary phage display technology 
in the near term  we expect to focus our efforts on completing the clinical development of dx for the treatment of hae 
in addition  we are moving forward on the clinical development of dx as a treatment for patients undergoing on pump cts  and will be in a position to advance one other product candidate into the clinic in in the long term  we expect that we  together with our licensees and collaborators  will continue to use our technology and expertise to develop and commercialize new therapeutic product candidates 
we continued to incur losses in and expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years 
we do not expect to generate profits unless and until the therapeutic products from our development portfolio reach the market  which can only occur after being subjected to the uncertainties of the regulatory approval process 
clinical development programs dx for hae 
we are developing dx as a treatment for hae 
through february   all development activities were conducted in collaboration with genzyme corporation and managed through dyax genzyme llc  a jointly owned limited liability company 
on february   we reached a mutual agreement with genzyme to terminate our collaboration 
see footnote investment in joint venture dyax genzyme llc and other related party transactions for additional information regarding this agreement 
as a result  we now own all of the rights to dx worldwide  and will be solely responsible for the future development of dx for hae 
in may  we successfully completed a phase ii  patient  dose escalating placebo controlled study  known as edema in january  we treated our last patient in a third phase ii trial  known as edema  and we commenced a placebo controlled  worldwide  multi center phase iii trial  known as edema  at the end of in november we treated the last patient in the edema trial 
in connection with the commencement of this trial in december  we received a million milestone payment from genzyme 
all of the clinical trials that we conducted in hae during utilized a mg subcutaneous dose  which was changed from an earlier intravenous method 
we expect to seek marketing approval using this dosing level and route of administration 
as a result of recent discussions with the fda  we plan to complete a confirmatory placebo controlled trial  known as edema  which we expect to start in the first quarter of this trial is intended to further support the validity of the patient reported outcome pro methodology used in the edema trial and confirm the efficacy and safety of dx in addition  an open label continuation study will be conducted to augment our clinical data with respect to dx in light of these trials and based upon our recent discussions with the fda  we are now estimating regulatory approval in the us in late  followed by approval in the european union 
we estimate the total remaining costs to commercialization to be in the range of million to million 
as a result of the termination of our collaboration with genzyme  we will be responsible for funding all of these costs 
under the terms of the termination agreement  we received all of the assets of dyax genzyme llc  including million of cash from a payment made by genzyme to the llc in connection with the termination  which will be used to partially offset these costs 
the following table illustrates the activity associated with dx for hae included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss years ended december  in thousands dx for hae costs included within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss less research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc per the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net research and development expenses for dx for hae equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net loss on dx for hae program pursuant to an agreement reached with genzyme in august  we assumed responsibility for the first million of manufacturing costs for a series of consecutive manufacturing batches  known as the validation campaign  which will validate the manufacturing process of dx for regulatory purposes and provide material for further clinical studies 
this arrangement was designed to ensure us an adequate supply of dx drug substance for programs outside of the dyax genzyme llc  specifically for our independently conducted program to develop dx for on pump cts procedures 
since these costs were not solely related to the use of dx for hae  they were not captured in research and development expenses for the dx for hae program  nor were they reimbursable by the joint venture when they occurred 
instead  under the terms of this arrangement  we agreed to supply the dx drug substance to the dyax genzyme llc upon request  at which point the cost of such product would become a research and development expense on the dx for hae program and reimbursable by the joint venture 
this arrangement ended in connection with the termination of the collaboration on february  during  our research and development expenses on the dx for hae program totaled million compared with million in and million in these expenses decreased million in over because expenses related to the manufacture of dx were not included as dx for hae costs in in  approximately million of expenses were incurred to manufacture dx specifically for the hae program 
the decrease related to manufacturing was offset by an aggregate increase of million in clinical trial and internal costs over the same period 
research and development expenses increased in over principally due to increased activity in the areas of manufacturing and clinical trial costs 
dyax genzyme llc became responsible for the reimbursement of all development expenses related to the hae program incurred after the completion of the first phase ii clinical trial for hae 
during  dyax genzyme llc reimbursed us for million of our research and development expenses 
this reimbursement is recorded as research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
during we will be reimbursed by genzyme for its share of expenses for the hae program that were incurred before the termination of the joint venture on february  this reimbursement will be in addition to the million for future costs that genzyme paid to the dyax genzyme llc in connection with the termination of the joint venture 
dyax genzyme llc had net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses represent the total research and development expenses incurred by dyax and genzyme on dx for hae 
our portion of the losses  accounted for under the equity method  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively and were proportional to our financial interest in the program before the termination of the joint venture 
our portions of the losses  referred to as our equity loss in joint venture  is separately classified within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss
