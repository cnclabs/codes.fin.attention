item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview forward looking statements 
this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of all statements other than statements of historical fact  including statements regarding prospects or future results of operations or financial position  made in this annual report on form k are forward looking 
we use words such as anticipates  believes  expects  future  intends  and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons  including  among others  the effects on the airline industry and the global economy of events such as terrorist activity  changes in oil prices and other disruptions to the world markets  trends in the airline industry  including growth rates of markets and other economic factors  risks associated with owning and leasing jet engines and aircraft  our ability to successfully negotiate equipment purchases  sales and leases  to collect outstanding amounts due and to control costs and expenses  changes in interest rates and availability of capital  our ability to continue to meet the changing customer demands  regulatory changes affecting airline operations  aircraft maintenance  accounting standards and taxes  the market value of engines and other assets our portfolio 
these risks and uncertainties  as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations  are described in greater detail in item a 
of part i  risk factors  which  along with the previous discussion  describes some  but not all  of the factors that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management s expectations 
general 
our core business is acquiring and leasing pursuant to operating leases  commercial aircraft engines and related aircraft equipment  and the selective sale of such engines  all of which we sometimes refer to as equipment 
we have no current plans to enter into finance leases although we may do so in the future 
as of december   we had lessees in countries 
our portfolio is continually changing due to acquisitions and sales 
as of december   our total lease portfolio consisted of engines and related equipment  four aircraft and three spare engine parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
on december   we entered into a joint venture with oasis international leasing usa  inc  called wolf 
wolf completed the purchase of two airbus a aircraft from boeing aircraft holding company for a purchase price of million 
we actively manage our portfolio and structure our leases to maximize the residual values of our leased assets 
our leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet engines manufactured by cfmi  general electric  pratt whitney  rolls royce and international aero engine 
these engines are the most widely used engines in the world  powering airbus  boeing  and mcdonnell douglas aircraft 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to residual values  estimated asset lives  bad debts  and income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  grouped by our activities  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease or finance lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
where collection cannot be reasonably assured  for example  upon a lessee bankruptcy  we do not recognize revenue until received 
we also estimate and charge to income a provision for bad debts based on our experience in the business and with each specific customer and the level of past due accounts 
the financial condition of our customers may deteriorate and result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
in addition  any deterioration in the financial condition of our customers may adversely affect future lease revenues 
as of december   all of our leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  we retain title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
we generally depreciate engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
for equipment which is unlikely to be repaired at the end of its current expected life  and is likely to be disassembled upon lease termination  we depreciate the equipment over its estimated life to a residual value based on an estimate of the wholesale value of the parts after disassembly 
currently  engines having a net book value of million are depreciated using this policy 
if useful lives or residual values are lower than those estimated by us  upon sale of the equipment  a loss may be realized 
beginning july   we changed the depreciation estimate related to the residual value of certain engines for which marketability has improved in the last year 
it is our policy to review estimates regularly to more accurately expense the cost of equipment over the useful life of the engines 
this change in depreciation estimate resulted in a million decrease in depreciation during and on an annual basis will result in a decrease in depreciation expense of million per year assuming no change in our portfolio 
sales related activities 
for equipment sold out of our lease portfolio  we recognize the gain or loss associated with the sale as revenue 
gain consists of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any costs directly associated with the sale 
additionally  to the extent that any deposits and maintenance reserves are included in the sale and the purchaser of the equipment assumes any liabilities associated therewith  such deposits and maintenance reserves are included in the gain on sale 
asset valuation 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of generally be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
impairment is identified by comparison of undiscounted forecasted cash flows  including estimated sales proceeds  over the life of the asset with the asset s book value minus maintenance reserves 
if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows are less than the book value  we write the asset down to its fair value 
we determine fair value by reference to independent appraisals  quoted market prices eg  an offer to purchase and other factors 
on september  the financial accounting standards board fasb posted the staff position fsp aug air accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
the fsp amends certain provisions in the aicpa industry audit guide  audits of airlines  and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting 
it prohibits the use of the currently allowed accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in the annual and interim financial statements 
this guidance is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented  unless impracticable to do so

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin  which becomes effective for us on january   clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim period  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
if the effect of initial adoption is determined to be material  the cumulative effect may be reported as an adjustment to the beginning of year retained earnings with disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected in the cumulative adjustment 
the guidance is applicable in our fiscal year 
we will apply this guidance in assessing any future misstatements 
also in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year 
we are in the process of assessing the effect sfas no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements 
on september  the fasb posted the fsp aug air accounting for planned major maintenance activities fsp 
the fsp amends certain provisions in the aicpa industry audit guide  audits of airlines  and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting 
the fsp prohibits the use of the currently allowed accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial statements 
this guidance is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented  unless impracticable to do so 
upon adoption of the fsp in our financial statements  we will retroactively change and financial statements to apply the new policy consistently for all periods presented 
under the terms of some of our leases  the lessees pay amounts to us based on usage  which are designed to cover the expected maintenance cost 
some of these amounts are reimbursable to the lessee if they make specifically defined maintenance expenditures 
through  all such fees received are recorded in maintenance reserves until such time as maintenance costs are reimbursed to the lessee or incurred by us after the end of the lease 
if our expenditures are in excess of the reserve and  under our capitalization policy  the expenditure extends the original life or improves functionality of the asset  the incremental expenditure is capitalized 
the maintenance reserves were considered in our impairment analysis 
in the analysis  carrying value was determined by deducting maintenance reserves from the asset s book value 
commencing in  use fees received will be recognized in revenue if they are not reimbursable to the lessee 
use fees that are reimbursable will be included in maintenance reserves until they are reimbursed to the lessee or the lease terminates  at which time they will be recognized in revenue 
our expenditures for maintenance will be expensed as incurred 
expenditures that meet the criteria for capitalization will be recorded as an addition to equipment recorded on the balance sheet 
the change in policy will result in a revised impairment analysis being performed without maintenance reserves included as part of the calculation of lease assets carrying value 
we will recognize additional impairment charges in prior periods based on this analysis 
income taxes would increase or decrease accordingly depending on the recognized revenue and expenses associated with the adoption of the accounting change 
based on our preliminary analysis  the potential impact of implementing the fsp on the financial statements will be to reduce maintenance reserve liability by million and increase shareholders equity by million as of december  the resulting change to the income statement for the years ended december  and is estimated as follows increase decrease in thousands revenue lease revenue gain on sale of leased equipment total revenue expenses depreciation expense write down of equipment other operating expenses total expenses earnings from operations income before income taxes income tax expense net income net income applicable to common shareholders liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through borrowings secured by our equipment lease portfolio 
cash of approximately million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt 
cash flow from operating activities generated million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
on february   we completed our public offering of  shares of our series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share  or approximately million in total 
after underwriting commissions and expenses of issuance  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
the preferred stock accrues cash dividends from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum  or approximately  per month 
the first dividend payment date was march  the payment of dividends  including with respect to the series a preferred stock  is at the discretion of our board of directors 
the series a preferred stock  which is a new series of our capital stock  is traded on the nasdaq national market 
our primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
purchases of equipment including capitalized costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on december  we repurchased million shares of our own common stock  or of the shares outstanding  at per share for a total cost of million from flighttechnics llc in a private transaction 
the repurchased shares were cancelled 
as a result of this transaction the total number of common shares outstanding was approximately million 
cash flows from operations are driven significantly by payments made under our lease agreements  which comprise lease revenue and maintenance reserves  and are offset by interest expense 
note that cash received from reserves arrangements are restricted per our debt arrangements 
while we have experienced increased lease rates  these have been offset by increases in interest rates such that the spread between lease rates and interest rates has narrowed throughout the lease revenue stream  in the short term  is at fixed rates while a substantial amount of our debt is at variable rates 
if interest rates increase it is unlikely we could increase lease rates in the short term and this would cause a reduction in our earnings 
revenue and maintenance reserves are also affected by the amount of equipment off lease 
approximately  by book value  of our assets were on lease at december   compared to approximately at december   and the average utilization rate for the year ended december   was compared to in the prior year 
if there is any increase in off lease rates or deterioration in lease rates that are not offset by reductions in interest rates  there will be a negative impact on earnings and cash flows from operations 
at december   notes payable consists of loans totaling million net of discounts of million payable over periods of months to approximately years with interest rates varying between approximately and excluding the effect of our interest rate derivative instruments 
the significant facilities are described below 
on june   we closed the renewal of our revolving credit facility increasing the capacity from million to million 
in december the capacity was increased to million 
the revolving credit facility is used to finance the acquisition of aircraft engines for lease as well as for general working capital purposes 
as of december   million was available under this facility 
the revolving facility ends in june with the final amount borrowed at june due in june the interest rate on this facility at december   was one month libor plus 
under the revolver facility  all subsidiaries except west engine funding llc jointly and severally guarantee payment and performance of the terms of the loan agreement 
the maximum guarantee is million plus any accrued and unpaid interest  fees or reimbursements but is limited at any given time to the sum of the principal outstanding plus accrued interest and fees 
the guarantee would be triggered by a default under the agreement 
on august   we closed the asset backed securitization through a newly created  bankruptcy remote  delaware statutory trust  willis engine securitization trust west 
west issued and sold million of term notes and approximately million of warehouse notes 
the warehouse notes allow for borrowings during a two year term  after which it is expected that they will be converted to term notes of west 
the assets and liabilities of west remain on our balance sheet at historical carrying value 
the net proceeds of the term notes issued by west were used primarily to repay the obligations under our previous warehouse facility  which was terminated 
as a result of this transaction we wrote off in approximately million of unamortized capitalized costs associated with the previous facility 
at december   million of west term notes and million of west warehouse notes were outstanding 
the term notes are divided into million series a notes and million series b notes 
the warehouse notes are divided into million series a notes and million series b notes 
the assets of west  west engine funding and any associated owner trust are not available to satisfy our obligations or any of our affiliates 
west is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
at december   interest on the series a notes and series a notes is one month libor plus a margin of and  respectively 
at december   interest on the series b notes and the series b notes is one month libor plus a margin of and a supplemental margin of  for a total margin of 
at december   we had warehouse and revolving credit facilities totaling approximately million compared to million at december  at december   and december   respectively  approximately million and million was available under these combined facilities 
at december  and  one month libor was and  respectively 
approximately million of our debt is repayable during such repayments consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
the table below summarizes our contractual commitments at december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest payments under long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total approximately million of the above debt is subject to our continuing to comply with the covenants of each financing  including debt equity ratios  minimum tangible net worth and minimum interest coverage ratios  and other eligibility criteria including customer and geographic concentration restrictions 
in addition  under these facilities  we can typically borrow of an engine purchase and between and of an aircraft or spare parts purchase 
therefore we must have other available funds for the balance of the purchase price of any new equipment to be purchased or we will not be permitted to draw on these facilities 
the facilities are also cross defaulted 
if we do not comply with the covenants or eligibility requirements  we may not be permitted to borrow additional funds and accelerated payments may become necessary 
additionally  debt is secured by engines on lease to customers and to the extent that engines are returned from lease early or are sold  repayment of that portion of the debt could be accelerated 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  we have estimated the interest payments due under long term debt by applying the interest rates applicable at december  to the remaining debt  adjusted for the estimated debt repayments identified in the table above 
actual interest payments made will vary due to changes in the rates for one month libor 
the interest estimate excludes the effect of any derivative instruments in place at the balance sheet date 
we have commitments to purchase  during and  engines for a gross purchase price of million  for delivery from january to december the lease of our office premises in sausalito expires on december  the sub lease of our premises in san diego expires in october our shanghai  china office lease expires in december we believe our equity base  internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain our level of operations through a decline in the level of internally generated funds  such as could result if off lease rates increase or there is a decrease in availability under our existing debt facilities  would impair our ability to sustain our level of operations 
we are discussing additions to our capital base with our commercial and investment banks 
if we are not able to access additional capital  our ability to continue to grow our asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and our future growth limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital 
management of interest rate exposure at december   million of our borrowings were on a variable rate basis at various interest rates tied to one month libor 
our equipment leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
increases in interest rates could narrow or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue we realize under our leases and the interest rate that we pay under our borrowings 
we have entered into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk and not to speculate or trade in these derivative products 
we currently have interest rate swap agreements which have notional outstanding amounts of million  with remaining terms of between three and months and fixed rates of between and 
the fair value of the swaps at december  and was positive million and million  respectively  representing a net asset for us 
commencing december  we applied hedge accounting per sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to record derivative instruments at fair value as either an asset or liability 
beginning in january  derivative instruments were recorded on our balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
we use derivative instruments primarily for interest rate swaps to manage the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
while substantially all our derivative transactions are entered into for the purposes described above  hedge accounting is only applied where specific criteria have been met and it is practicable to do so 
in order to apply hedge accounting  the transaction must be designated as a hedge and it must be highly effective 
the hedging instrument s effectiveness is assessed utilizing regression analysis at the inception of the hedge and on at least a quarterly basis throughout its life 
hedges are considered highly effective when a correlation coefficient between and is achieved 
all of the transactions that we have designated as hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the period during which the transaction being hedged affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of these hedges flows through earnings in the current period 
settlement gains and losses are recorded in interest expense 
the cash settlements on these derivative instrument arrangements reduced interest expense by million in and created additional expense of million in  respectively 
prior to december   all changes in the derivatives fair values were recognized in earnings in realized and unrealized gains and losses derivative instruments  after that date hedge accounting was applied 
settlement gains and losses on derivative instruments not accounted for as hedges are recorded in realized and unrealized gains or losses from derivative instruments 
net finance costs for the years ended december  and december  were decreased by million and million due to realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments  respectively 
realized and unrealized gains and losses include both the change in fair value of derivative instruments as well as the cash settlement expense or income due to the derivative instruments for the period for all instruments not receiving hedge accounting treatment 
the components of realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments for each of the years ended december   and are shown in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  increase decrease to net finance costs change in fair value of derivative instruments cash settlement expense total realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments we will be exposed to risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate hedge counter parties 
we anticipate that we may hedge additional amounts of our floating rate debt during the next year 
related party and similar transactions we occasionally sell or consign engines to and purchase materials from avioserv  the successor to our former subsidiary and current subsidiary of t group america 
t group america is owned by t group f k a sr technics group  an entity that is related to flighttechnics llc  which held of our common stock  until it was repurchased by us for million on december  we also sub lease office space from avioserv with the lease term expiring october  during the year ended december   we sold one engine to avioserv at a net gain of  we have two engines consigned to avioserv and during the twelve month period ended december   million book value of engine parts were sold 
the book value for the engine consigned to avioserv as of december  was million

willis  iv is the president  ceo and chairman of our board of directors and owns approximately of our common stock as of december  island air leases four dehaviland dhc aircraft and two engines from us  under non cancelable leases which will generate lease revenue of approximately million in and million in and have a net book value of million 
island air s obligations under four of these leases are guaranteed by aloha 
however  in december  aloha filed for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
with its emergence from chapter in february  aloha s obligations under its guaranty were discharged 
in  in response to a fare war commenced by a competitor  island air requested a reduction in lease rent payments from us and a deferral of five months lease rent totaling   per month was granted by the board of directors 
the deferral was accounted for as a reduction in lease revenue in the period 
the deferred amount will be added to the lease rents charged for two of the aircraft in  upon the expiry of those leases 
the lease rent deferral has been extended further in by two months jan feb and any further rent deferral requests from island air will be considered by the board of directors on a month to month basis 
after taking into account the deferred amounts  island air remains current on all obligations and no provision has been made for any loss 
we entered into a consignment agreement dated may   with jt power llc jt power  an entity whose majority shareholder  austin willis  is the son of our president and chief executive officer  and directly and indirectly  a shareholder of ours 
during the six months ended december   sales were million 
the book value for the parts consigned to jt power as of december  was on july   we entered into an aircraft engine agency agreement with jt power  llc  in which we will on a non exclusive basis  provide engine lease opportunities with respect to available spare engines at jt power 
jt power will pay us a fee equal to a percentage of the rent collected by jt power for the duration of the lease including renewals thereof 
revenue of  was earned during the period from inception of the agreement to december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in the libor rates would affect our cost of borrowing 
increases in interest rates to us  which may cause us to raise the implicit rates charged to our customers  could result in a reduction in demand for our leases 
alternatively  we may price our leases based on market rates so as to keep the fleet on lease and suffer a decrease in our operating margin due to interest costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers 
approximately million of our outstanding debt is variable rate debt 
we estimates a one percent increase or decrease in our variable rate debt net of derivative instruments would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum in  million per annum 
we estimate a two percent increase or decrease in our variable rate debt net of derivative instruments would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum in  million per annum 
we hedge a portion of our borrowings  effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings 
based on the implied forward rates for one month libor  we expect interest expenses will be reduced by approximately million for the year ending december   as a result of our hedges 
such hedging activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates  but may also protect us from increases in interest rates 
furthermore  since lease rates tend to vary with interest rate levels  it is possible that we can adjust lease rates for the effect of change in interest rates at the termination of leases 
other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates 
we are also exposed to currency devaluation risk 
during   and  respectively    and of our total lease revenues came from non united states domiciled lessees 
all of our leases require payment in us dollars 
if these lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making their lease payments
