item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s financial condition  including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to our consolidated activities for the three years ended december  references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of northwest natural gas company  which principally consists of our regulated local gas distribution business  our regulated gas storage business  and our other non regulated businesses  which includes our wholly owned subsidiary business  nng financial corporation financial corporation 
in this report  the term utility is used to describe our regulated gas distribution business  and the term non utility is used to describe our gas storage business segment gas storage  previously referred to as interstate gas storage  and our other non regulated activities other see note 
in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  certain measures are expressed in cents per share 
these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings 
we believe this per share information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on earnings 
all references in this report to earnings per share are on the basis of diluted shares see note  earnings per share 
executive summary our strategy in was to remain focused on profitably growing our regulated utility and gas storage businesses 
the utility is our largest business segment with approximately percent of consolidated total assets  which contributed percent of consolidated net income in factors critical to the success of the utility include maintaining a safe and reliable distribution system  acquiring an adequate supply of gas  providing distribution services at a competitive price  and being able to recover the operating and capital costs of the utility in the rates charged to customers 
the utility is regulated by two state commissions  the oregon public utility commission opuc and the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc 
our gas storage segment represents approximately percent of consolidated total assets and contributed percent of consolidated net income in this business unit primarily provides firm and interruptible gas storage at our mist underground storage facility to large interstate and intrastate customers using storage and related transportation capacity that is in excess of our utility s core residential  commercial and industrial firm customer requirements 
asset optimization is also part of the gas storage segment  with optimization services provided for the utility under an agreement with an independent energy marketing company 
factors critical to the success of our gas storage business segment include the ability to develop additional storage capacity at competitive market prices  plan for the replacement of capacity that is expected to be recalled by the utility to serve its core customers in the future  and obtain timely and reasonable rate changes 
highlights of include net income and diluted earnings per share increased percent in  to million and per share  
table of contents solid growth in net operating revenues from our regulated utility distribution and gas storage businesses were major drivers to increased earnings in  net operating revenues from our regulated utility increased percent to million  largely attributable to strong customer growth  which increased by more than percent for the th consecutive year  and increased margin sharing from gas cost savings through our regulatory incentive mechanism  net operating revenues from gas storage increased percent to million  including a higher amount of revenue sharing with our utility customers  which increased percent to million  operations and maintenance expense increases were held to percent in  including incremental costs for employee retirement and severance programs and employee bonuses tied to improved financial results which were largely offset by cost reductions from business process redesign initiatives that we began implementing in  cash flow from operations increased percent to million  reflecting strong operating and working capital results  million of new long term debt was issued in the fourth quarter of  with the proceeds being used to redeem short term debt and fund capital expenditures  in a jd power associates residential customer survey  nw natural ranked first in the nation for customer satisfaction with billing and payment services  and third in the nation for overall customer satisfaction among the largest gas utilities  and  our quarterly common stock dividend rate increased percent to per share in the fourth quarter of  making this the st consecutive year of increasing dividends paid to shareholders 
issues  challenges and performance measures a number of factors affect our operations and financial performance 
the most significant issue the utility faces in the near term is high gas prices 
wholesale gas prices over the past few years have increased significantly  primarily due to increasing demand 
in  the gas supply market tightened significantly as hurricanes hit parts of the united states  resulting in the disruption of gas supplies and causing gas prices to spike 
since then  gas prices have moderated and are now relatively more stable than last year 
we expect energy prices to remain slightly higher than in the past few years  with higher gas prices already reflected in our customers bills for the heating season 
we believe we have sufficient supplies of natural gas under contract to meet the needs of our firm customers  but further price increases for gas could change our competitive advantage and our customers preference for natural gas 
if higher gas prices persist  it could significantly affect our ability to add residential and commercial customers and could result in industrial customers shifting their businesses energy needs to alternative fuel sources 
to address these competitive issues  we are continually developing new gas acquisition strategies to manage gas prices and meet market demands  and we are working on initiatives intended to improve operational efficiencies throughout the company through a comprehensive business process redesign effort see business process redesign  below 
other issues and challenges we expect to face in include executing on our business process redesign initiatives  managing gas supplies and prices under unpredictable market conditions  managing the potential impact of adverse regulatory actions or policy changes  managing storage and transportation capacity  managing and maintaining customer growth  maintaining a competitive advantage over alternative fuels and managing environmental risks and exposures and higher interest rates 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other risks  see part i  item a risk factors  
table of contents above  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below  and forward looking statements  below  following item a 
our strategic plan addresses the risks affecting our business by focusing on improving our ability to add customers profitably  managing wholesale natural gas prices through an active hedging program to keep customer prices stable and as low as possible  maintaining our reputation for exemplary customer service  reducing business risks  managing all costs  including capital investments  maintaining a strong financial position  improving our cost structure through business process redesign initiatives  and judiciously growing beyond our local distribution business where such growth would complement our core assets and competencies 
return on invested capital and common equity ratios are key indicators of our operating performance and financial condition 
we compare our utility return on equity results each year against the return authorized by the opuc 
we also compare our total shareholder return stock price appreciation plus dividends against a peer group of local gas distribution companies because it is necessary for us to attract investors so that we can continue to cost effectively raise the capital needed to run our businesses 
other key performance measures we use in monitoring progress against our goals include earnings per share  cash provided by operations  free cash flow cash from operations less payments for investing activities and dividends  customer satisfaction ratings  customer additions  operations and maintenance expense per customer  construction cost per meter installed and non revenue producing capital expenditures per customer 
strategic opportunities business process redesign 
during  we initiated a project to evaluate our business processes and costs against our peers and to redesign those processes where long term efficiencies could be gained 
we identified a number of areas where we could restructure our business to gain efficiencies  including more centralization  an increased focus on process orientation  and more standardized processes 
in order to effectively implement these strategies  we are taking steps to redesign our business into the following six core areas to more effectively group and focus resources around our business processes acquire customers 
focuses on the integration of activities involved in acquiring customers  including construction  sales  marketing and operation of our retail appliance center 
serve customers 
focuses on all aspects of how we serve our customer base  including customer contact  meter reading  account services and field services areas 
deliver gas 
focuses on the transportation of gas to our customers and includes qualification assurance of our employees  engineering and code compliance 
energy supply 
focuses on procuring gas  pipeline integrity  gas storage and business development for the future 
resource management 
focuses on how well we use the resources at our disposal by centralizing dispatch and scheduling  business analysis and technology implementation 
business services 
focuses on supporting all of the areas above through human resources  information technology  regulation  finance  legal and other administrative functions 

table of contents we have begun the implementation of this business model  which is expected to continue over the next several years 
workforce reductions related to the implementation of this new model are expected to be accomplished primarily through attrition and voluntary severance arrangements 
in  we incurred costs of million related to workforce reductions of approximately employees 
pipeline diversity 
in september  we announced that we are evaluating a potential pipeline project that would connect transcanada s gas transmission northwest gtn interstate transmission line to our local gas distribution system 
we have commenced a process to determine if there is sufficient interest by potential customers to justify construction of the pipeline 
if the project is determined to be viable  we would form a partnership with gtn to build and own the pipeline 
in addition to owning a share of the pipeline  we would anticipate being a large user of the pipeline and gtn would be its operator 
the pipeline would be intended to provide our utility customers and gtn s customers with a more diversified delivery source and greater reliability of gas supplies from the interstate system 
the decision on whether to proceed with the development of the pipeline is expected to be made in no material contractual obligations related to the pipeline have been incurred as of december  if constructed  commercial operation would be expected to commence in earnings and dividends net income was million  or a diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or a share  and million  or a share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
returns on equity for these three years were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
compared to positive factors contributing to increased earnings were increased utility volumes and net operating revenues margin from sales to residential and commercial customers due to percent customer growth  plus extended coverage from the weather normalization and conservation mechanisms in oregon  partially offset by weather that was percent warmer than average and percent warmer than see results of operations comparison of gas distribution operations  below  and results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below  increased margin from regulatory sharing of gas cost savings  from million in to million in  partially offset by a million temporary unrealized loss related to a derivative contract that will settle and reverse in  and increased gas storage margin over the prior year  primarily due to increased storage contract volumes and increased optimization revenue from the independent energy marketing company 
partially offsetting the above positive factors were increased property tax and depreciation expenses related to increased utility plant in service  which were partially covered by revenue increases approved in the most recent purchased gas adjustment pga filings in oregon and washington  
table of contents increased operations and maintenance expense related to higher bonuses tied to improved performance results and to employee severance charges tied to business redesign initiatives  partially offset by lower payroll and employee benefit costs  and increased income tax expense related to higher taxable income 
compared to positive factors contributing to increased earnings were increased utility volumes and net operating revenues from sales to residential and commercial customers due to percent customer growth  percent colder weather and conservation tariff mechanisms  partially offset by declining average use per customer and a decrease in the contribution from the weather normalization mechanism see results of operations comparison of gas distribution operations  below  and results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below  decreased utility volumes but increased utility margin from industrial customers  primarily reflecting a shift of several customers to higher margin service which offset the overall decline in volumes  increased utility margin from miscellaneous revenues  and increased gas storage margin primarily due to increased storage services under contract and higher optimization revenues 
partially offsetting the above positive factors were increased operations and maintenance expense related to increased payroll and employee benefit costs  increased damages to company property  industrial customer settlement charges and employee severance charges  increased property tax and depreciation expenses related to increased utility plant in service  which were partially covered by revenue increases approved in the most recent pga and general rate cases in oregon and washington  and increased income tax expense related to higher taxable income

application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers our critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if we reported under different conditions or used different assumptions 
our most critical estimates or judgments involve regulatory cost recovery  revenue recognition  derivative instruments  pension assumptions  income taxes and environmental contingencies 

table of contents management has discussed the estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
within the context of our critical accounting policies and estimates  management is not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
regulatory accounting we are regulated by the opuc and wutc  which establish our utility rates and rules governing utility services provided to customers  and  to a certain extent  set forth the accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions 
in general  we use the same accounting principles as non regulated companies reporting under gaap 
however  certain accounting principles  primarily statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of such regulation 
for example  we account for the cost of gas using a pga deferral and cost recovery mechanism  which is submitted for approval annually to the opuc and wutc see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
there are other expenses or revenues that the opuc or wutc may require us to defer for recovery or refund in future periods 
sfas no 
requires us to account for these types of deferred expenses or deferred revenues as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet 
when we are allowed to recover these expenses from or refund them to customers  we recognize the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time we realize the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates charged to customers 
the conditions we must satisfy to adopt the accounting policies and practices of sfas no 
 which are applicable to regulated companies  include an independent regulator sets rates  the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
we continue to apply sfas no 
in accounting for our regulated utility operations 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could require us to discontinue the application of sfas no 
for some or all of our regulated businesses 
this would require the write off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers 
based on current regulatory and competitive conditions  we believe that it is reasonable to expect continued application of sfas no 
for our regulated activities  and that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities at december  and are recoverable or refundable through future customer rates 
see note  industry regulation 
revenue recognition utility revenues  derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas  are recognized when gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
revenues are accrued for gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed  based on estimates of gas deliveries from the last meter reading date to month end accrued unbilled revenues 
accrued unbilled revenues are primarily based 
table of contents on a percentage estimate of our unbilled gas each month  which is dependent upon a number of factors  some of which require management s judgment 
these factors include total gas receipts and deliveries  customer meter reading dates  customer usage patterns and weather 
accrued unbilled revenue estimates are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
estimated unbilled revenues at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in accrued unbilled revenues at year end was primarily due to higher gas prices included in customer rates and higher volumes reflecting customer growth 
if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at december  was adjusted up or down by percent  then our unbilled revenues  net operating revenues and net income would have increased or decreased by an estimated million  million and million  respectively 
non utility revenues  derived primarily from our gas storage business segment  are recognized upon delivery of the service to customers 
revenues from our optimization partner are recognized over the life of the optimization contract for the guaranteed amount  or are recognized as they are earned for amounts above the guaranteed value based on information provided by the independent energy marketing company 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities our financial derivatives policy and gas acquisition policy set forth guidelines for using selected financial derivative products to support prudent risk management strategies within designated parameters 
these policies specifically prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the accounting rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex 
the contracts that qualify as derivative instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
if certain regulatory conditions are met  then the fair value is recorded together with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability account pursuant to sfas no 
see note  industry regulation  and no gain or loss is recognized in current income 
the gain or loss from the fair value of a derivative instrument that is subject to regulatory deferral is included in the recovery from  or refund to  utility customers in future periods see regulatory accounting  above 
if a derivative contract is not subject to regulatory deferral  then the accounting treatment for gains and losses is made in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 collectively referred to as sfas no 
see note  derivatives and industry regulation 
our estimate of fair value is determined from period to period based on an internal discounted cash flow model using exchange based forward market prices that are subject to market volatility  except for option contracts where fair value is based on a black scholes model 
the estimate of fair value may change significantly from period to period depending on market conditions and prices 
these changes may have a material impact on our results of operations  but the impact would be largely mitigated due to the majority of our derivatives activities being subject to regulatory deferral treatment 
for estimated fair values at december  and  see note derivative contracts entered into after our annual pga filing for the current gas contract period are subject to a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism in oregon  with percent of unrealized gains and losses recorded to a regulatory asset or liability account and the remaining percent recognized in current income 
the unrealized loss on financial derivative contracts entered into during the fourth quarter of  which was after the pga filing  totaled million  of which million was recorded in cost of gas as of december  this unrealized loss will be reversed in when the derivative contracts are settled 

table of contents the following table summarizes the amount of realized gains and losses from commodity price and currency hedge transactions for the last three years thousands net gain loss on commodity price swaps for utility net loss on commodity price options for utility subtotal on commodity for utility net loss on commodity price swaps for gas storage net gain on foreign currency forward purchases for utility total realized net gain loss realized gains losses from commodity price and foreign currency forward purchase contracts are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark to market valuations are generally not recognized in current income or other comprehensive income  but are recorded as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  which are offset by a corresponding balance in non trading derivative assets or liabilities see note 
accounting for pensions we maintain two qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering all regular employees with more than one year of service  several non qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees and other employee postretirement benefit plans 
only the two qualified defined benefit pension plans have plan assets  which are held in a qualified trust to fund retirement benefits 
net periodic pension costs pension costs and projected benefit obligations benefit obligations are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  using a number of key assumptions including discount rates  rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and the expected long term return on plan assets see financial condition pension cost and funding status  below  and note 
these key assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
pension costs consist of service costs  interest costs  the amortization of actuarial gains  losses and prior service costs  the expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the market related valuation reflects differences between expected returns and actual investment returns  which are recognized over a three year period from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year volatility in pension costs 
effective december   the funded status of our pension plans is required to be recognized in accordance with sfas no 
see employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans under note  new accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of tax  based on the fair value of plan assets compared to the actuarial value of future benefit obligations 
however  the pension costs relating to certain nw natural pension plans are recovered in utility rates based on sfas no 
 and as such we received regulatory approval from the opuc to record a regulatory asset or regulatory liability  rather than include aoci in common equity  for the funded status of those plans pursuant to sfas no 
see regulatory accounting  above  and note  industry regulation 
as a result of regulatory approval we recognized a million regulatory asset for the unfunded status of these qualified pension and other 
table of contents postretirement benefit plans 
if future regulatory changes are to occur that will affect our ability to recover pension costs based on sfas no 
 then we would be required to adjust a portion or all of the deferred regulatory asset amount for pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
this would cause us to recognize the million after tax charge to common equity and a million deferred income tax asset based on the december  funded status  but it would not have an immediate impact on current earnings 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 total assets increased million  total liabilities increased million and equity decreased million see note 
a number of factors are considered in developing pension assumptions  including an evaluation of relevant discount rates  expected long term investment returns  plan asset allocations  expected changes in salaries  wages and retirement benefits  analyses of current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
for the december  measurement date  we increased the pension discount rate assumptions from percent to a range of percent to percent 
the new rate assumptions were determined for each plan based on a matching of the estimated cash flow  which reflects the timing and amount of future benefit payments  to the citigroup above median curve  which consists of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by standard poor s or aa or higher by moody s investor service  updated the retirement and withdrawal rates based on a recent study of actual plan experience  confirmed the expected rate of future compensation increases between and percent  and confirmed the expected long term return on plan assets at percent 
the benefit obligation at december  decreased million due to the increase in the discount rate and increased million due to the retirement and withdrawal rates updated for actual experience 
we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate an analysis of historical actual performance and long term return projections  which gives consideration to the current asset mix and our target asset allocation 
the actual annualized returns for the past one year  five year and year periods ended december  were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we believe our pension assumptions to be appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions 
however  the following shows the sensitivity of our pension costs and benefit obligations to future changes in certain actuarial assumptions thousands  except percent change in assumption impact on pension costs impact on benefit obligations at dec 
 discount rate expected long term return on plan assets n a the impact of a change in pension costs on operating results would be less than the amounts shown above because only between and percent of our pension costs is charged to operations and maintenance expense 
the remaining to percent is capitalized to construction accounts as payroll overhead and included in utility plant  which is amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset placed into service 

table of contents accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by recognizing deferred income taxes for all temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities at current income tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires the recognition of additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators require us to flow through deferred income tax benefits or expenses in the ratemaking process of the regulated utility regulatory tax assets and liabilities 
this is consistent with the ratemaking policies of the opuc and wutc 
regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent we believe they will be recoverable from  or refunded to  customers in future rates 
at december  and  we had regulatory assets representing differences between book and tax basis related to pre property of million and million  respectively  and recorded an offsetting deferred tax liability for the same amounts see note  income tax expense 
we believe that it is reasonable to expect recovery of these regulatory assets through future customer rates 
however  future regulatory changes could require the write off of all or a portion of these regulatory assets should they no longer be probable of recovery in future rates see regulatory accounting  above  and notes and 
a recent interpretation of sfas no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 was issued by the fasb in july to address how companies should account for the tax benefits of timing and permanent income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
sfas no 
contains rules which set out how the benefits of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are to be reflected in current and deferred income taxes for financial reporting purposes  but it does not establish a confidence level or threshold that must be met in order to recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which for us was january  adoption of fin will require us to identify and evaluate all material tax positions taken in previously filed and still open tax returns as well as tax positions expected to be taken in future returns 
each tax position will need to be examined to determine whether the more likely than not recognition standard has been met  and if so  to compute the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized under fin based upon a preliminary assessment of the application of fin  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimates of loss contingencies  including estimates of legal defense costs when such costs are probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable  and related disclosures are updated when new information becomes available 
estimating probable losses requires an analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
accruals for loss contingencies are recorded based on an analysis of potential results  developed in consultation with outside counsel and consultants when appropriate 
when information is sufficient to estimate only a range of potential liabilities  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  we recognize an accrued liability at the low end of the range and disclose the range see contingent liabilities  below 
it is possible  however  that the range of potential liabilities could be 
table of contents significantly different than amounts currently accrued and disclosed  with the result that our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in the assumptions or estimates related to these contingencies 
with respect to our environmental liabilities and related costs  we develop estimates based on currently available information  existing technology and environmental regulations 
we previously received regulatory approval to defer and seek recovery of costs related to certain sites and believe the recovery of any costs not recovered under our general liability insurance policies is probable through the regulatory process see note 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a regulatory asset for the amount expected to be recovered 
we intend to first pursue recovery for these environmental costs from our general liability insurance policies  which  to the extent successful  would require a corresponding reduction in the regulatory asset 
at december   million in environmental costs have been recorded as a regulatory asset  including million of costs paid to date and million accrued for estimated future environmental costs 
if it is determined that both the insurance recovery and future rate recovery of such costs are not probable  then the costs will be charged to expense in the period such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations regulatory matters regulation and rates we are subject to regulation with respect to  among other matters  rates  systems of accounts and issuance of securities by the opuc and the wutc 
in  percent of our utility gas deliveries and percent of our utility operating revenues were derived from oregon customers and the balance from washington customers 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the pace of continued growth in the residential and commercial markets and by our ability to remain price competitive  control expenses  and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery for our utility gas costs  operating and maintenance costs and investments made in utility plant 
general rate cases our most recent general rate increase in oregon authorized rates to customers based on a return on shareholders equity roe of percent and was effective september  our most recent general rate case in washington authorized a revenue increase of million per year but did not specifically authorize an roe and was effective july  in may  we reached a settlement with the staff of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and all intervenors with respect to our rate case filed in january related to mist interstate storage service 
the settlement provided for a small net increase in the maximum rates for our interstate storage services  which became effective july  the rates established in this case are designed to reflect updated costs related to investments in the mist gas storage facility since and costs associated with the south mist pipeline extension project 
rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment 
rate changes are applied each year under the pga tariff mechanisms in oregon and washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas 
table of contents commodity purchases  including contractual arrangements to hedge the purchase price with financial derivatives see comparison of gas distribution operations cost of gas sold  below  interstate pipeline demand charges  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in deferred regulatory accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year 
under the current pga mechanisms  we collect an amount for purchased gas costs based on estimates included in rates 
if the actual purchased gas costs differ from the estimated amounts included in rates  then we are required to defer that difference and pass it on to customers as an adjustment to future rates 
as part of an incentive mechanism in oregon  only percent of the difference is deferred such that the impact on current earnings is either a charge to expense for percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or a credit to expense for percent of the lower cost of gas sold 
in washington  the pga deferral is percent of the higher or lower actual cost of gas sold 
the opuc and the wutc approved pga rate increases on october  that became effective on november  the effect of the pga rate changes was to increase the average monthly bills of oregon residential sales customers by percent and those of washington residential sales customers by percent 
the opuc also approved a modification to our pga deferral mechanism  effective november   which provides that we use actual recoveries of gas costs in revenues billed instead of the prior method that used estimated deliveries for gas costs incorporated in monthly rates compared to actual purchased gas costs 
the new method requires changes in line loss expense to be subject to the pga deferral mechanism  with percent of any cost differences for oregon volumes deferred for refund or recovery in customer rates in subsequent periods and the remaining percent included in current earnings 
these pga increases included increased transportation costs see interstate pipeline rate cases  below 
pursuant to the pga tariffs  rate increases were approved by the opuc averaging percent for oregon residential sales customers  and by the wutc averaging percent for washington residential sales customers  both effective october  in  the opuc approved a pga rate increase averaging percent for oregon residential sales customers  and the wutc approved a pga rate increase averaging percent for washington residential sales customers  effective october and november   respectively 
the opuc notified us that they will be conducting a formal review of the pga process covering gas portfolio requirements  incentive sharing levels and filing requirements  among other items 
the investigation is expected to be completed in early implementation of any changes to the pga mechanism is expected to be effective with the pga filing 
conservation tariff 
in october  the opuc authorized the implementation of a conservation tariff  which is a rate mechanism designed to adjust margin to compensate the utility for changes in consumption patterns due to residential and commercial customers conservation efforts 
the tariff is a decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between earnings and the quantity of energy consumed by customers  removing any incentive to discourage customers conservation efforts 
in washington  customer use is not covered by a conservation tariff  and as such our utility earnings are affected by increases and decreases in usage based on customers conservation efforts 
washington customers account for about percent of utility revenues 
in  an independent study to measure the mechanism s effectiveness recommended continuation of the conservation tariff  with minor modifications 
in and  the opuc approved the continuations of the conservation tariff through september   and increased the 
table of contents mechanism s coverage from a partial decoupling of percent of residential and commercial gas usage to a full decoupling of percent 
weather normalization 
in november  the opuc authorized  and the utility implemented  a weather normalization mechanism in oregon that helps stabilize utility margins by adjusting residential and commercial customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather 
the current normalization mechanism is applied to our residential and commercial customers bills between december and may for each heating season 
the mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers rates to reflect average weather  which uses the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
daily average temperatures and year average temperatures are based on a set point temperature of degrees fahrenheit for residential customers and degrees fahrenheit for commercial customers see comparison of gas distribution operations  below 
we do not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for our washington customers 
excess earnings test 
the opuc has a formalized process to test for excess utility earnings annually and has confirmed our ability to pass through percent of prudently incurred gas costs into rates 
we are authorized to retain all of our earnings up to a threshold level equal to our authorized roe of percent plus basis points 
one third of any earnings above that level will be refunded to customers 
the excess earnings threshold is subject to adjustment up or down each year depending on movements in long term interest rates 
in and  the threshold after adjustment was percent and percent  respectively 
no amounts were required to be refunded to customers as a result of the or earnings test and we do not expect that any amounts will be required to be refunded to customers as a result of the earnings test  which will be reviewed by the opuc during the second quarter of in washington  we are not subject to an annual excess earnings test  and percent of all prudently incurred gas costs are passed through into customer rates 
recent changes to industrial tariffs 
in august  the opuc and wutc approved tariff changes to the service options for our major industrial accounts 
the changes set out additional parameters that give us more certainty in the level of gas supplies we will need to acquire to serve this customer group 
the parameters include an annual election period  special pricing provisions for out of cycle changes and a requirement that customers on our annual weighted average cost of gas tariff complete the term of their service election 
pipeline integrity cost recovery 
in july  the opuc approved our applications relating to the accounting treatment and full recovery for the cost of the pipeline integrity management program  as mandated by the pipeline safety improvement act of and related rules adopted by the us department of transportation s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration see financial condition cash flows investing activities  below 
we classify our costs as either capital expenditures or regulatory assets  accumulate the costs over each month period ending june  and recover the costs  subject to audit  through rate changes effective with the annual pga 
the accounting and rate treatment for these costs extends through september  and may be reviewed for potential extension after that date 
we do not have any special accounting or rate treatment for pipeline integrity costs incurred in the state of washington 
interstate pipeline rate cases on june   the two interstate pipeline companies that provide natural gas transportation to our distribution system filed for general rate increases with the ferc 
northwest pipeline 
table of contents corporation northwest pipeline filed for an overall cost of service increase of approximately million a percent increase  including an increase in the firm transportation rate of approximately percent 
in connection with this filing  our firm gas transportation rates increased by approximately million annually 
the major components in the northwest pipeline increase relate to a significant capacity replacement project  other capacity displacement projects  an increase in the rate of return and higher operation and maintenance expenses and costs associated with accounting changes to expense pipeline integrity assessment costs 
the filed rates and associated tariff sheets became effective on january   subject to refund pending the outcome of further proceedings in the case 
in february  northwest pipeline filed a settlement proposal with the ferc that would resolve all issues with the active parties and would result in an increase in our transportation rates of about million 
amounts collected from our customers in excess of this settlement amount will be deferred and returned to customers in our next pga rate request in late gas transmission northwest s gtn rate case proposes  among other things  an increase in firm transportation rates of approximately percent 
in connection with this filing  our transportation rates on that pipeline increased by approximately million annually 
the primary reason for gtn s filing was unsubscribed capacity on the system due to significant capacity turnback and shipper defaults 
the filed rates and associated tariff sheets became effective on january   subject to refund pending further proceedings in the case 
increases in interstate pipeline transportation expenses are subject to our pga mechanism and are percent passed through to customers in both oregon and washington 
both of the filed general rate increases were reflected in our pga filings 
utility regulation legislation during  the oregon legislature passed senate bill sb relating to taxes collected by utilities in rates on or after january  sb requires oregon investor owned electric and gas utilities to file annual reports and other information with the opuc 
the report is to be filed by october of the year following the reporting year and must identify the amount of income taxes paid  either by the utility or its consolidated group and properly attributed to the utility  as well as the amount of taxes authorized to be collected in rates 
if the opuc determines that the difference between the two amounts is greater than  the utility is required to establish an automatic adjustment clause to adjust rates 
in september  the opuc issued a final order adopting permanent rules to implement sb the permanent rules established reference points for determining margins and effective tax rates from a utility s ratemaking proceedings 
in addition  the opuc adopted an apportionment methodology for determining taxes properly attributed to the utility from a consolidated tax filing 
the opuc also determined that interest should accrue beginning january   using a mid year convention for amounts determined under the automatic adjustment clause 
utilities subject to sb were required to seek a private letter ruling plr from the internal revenue service requesting a ruling as to whether a utility s compliance with the provisions of sb would cause the utility to fail to comply with provisions of federal tax law  including the normalization requirements of the internal revenue code 
we submitted our plr to the internal revenue service in december while a utility s request for a plr is pending  no rate adjustment will be implemented 
however  interest will begin to accrue on the amount of any rate adjustment determined by the opuc 

table of contents based on our assessment of the permanent rules  we have estimated that our tax report for the tax year will reflect a surcharge of approximately million  that is  the amount of taxes paid to government entities will exceed the amount of taxes the utility collected in rates  thus creating a rate adjustment that requires a reimbursement from customers 
it is anticipated that any amounts due from customers for the tax year would not be realized until after june   pending a review by the opuc 
we have determined that the recognition of this regulatory gain in our statement of operations is uncertain until the opuc completes its review of how the final rules will be applied to our financial results  the underlying estimates are finalized  and efforts in the current oregon legislative session to potentially change certain provisions of sb are completed 
based on our current corporate structure and level of non utility investments and activities  we do not expect that ongoing compliance with sb will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
these reclassifications had no impact on prior year results of operations 

table of contents compared to total utility margin increased million or percent in compared to with residential and commercial customers contributing an additional million to margin in  including weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms 
the million increase in margin from industrial customers in was offset by a decrease in revenue adjustments from regulatory deferrals and amortizations and miscellaneous fees 
the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms decreased margin by a net million in compared to  primarily reflecting lower than expected consumption decline due to customer conservation efforts 
our customer base continued to grow in  with a net increase of  customers 
the growth rate for was percent  compared to percent in the slower growth rate in was primarily due to a smaller increase in residential customers reflecting a modest slowdown in new construction 
our utility margin results are affected by customer growth and to a certain extent by changes in weather and customer consumption patterns  with a significant portion of our earnings being derived from natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers 
in oregon  we have a conservation tariff that adjusts margin up or down based on changes in residential and commercial customer consumption  and we have a weather normalization mechanism that adjusts customer bills and our margin up or down based on above or below average temperatures during the winter heating season see results of operations regulatory developments rate mechanisms  above 
both mechanisms are designed to reduce the volatility of our utility earnings 
in  weather was percent warmer than in the weather normalization mechanism added million to margin for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent warmer than average 
the mechanism reduced margin by million in based on weather that was percent warmer than average 
generally  we would have expected the weather normalization mechanism in to recover lost margin when temperatures were warmer than average  but that year we lost heating volumes and corresponding margin revenues in the latter part of may when temperatures were significantly warmer than average because those volume and margin losses were not entirely covered by the weather normalization mechanism  which ends on may each year 
the decoupling mechanism decreased margin by million in  after adjusting for price elasticity in the annual oregon pga filing  compared to a contribution of million in compared to total margin increased million or percent in compared to with residential and commercial customers contributing an additional million to margin  including weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms 
industrial customers contributed an additional million to margin  and revenue adjustments for regulatory deferrals and amortizations and miscellaneous fees increased margin by million 
the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms adjusted margin down by million in compared to  primarily reflecting the impact of percent colder weather in our customer base increased by  in for a growth rate of percent  compared to percent in 
table of contents in  weather was percent colder than in  which partially contributed to the percent increase in margin from residential and commercial sales from those customers not covered by weather normalization 
the weather normalization mechanism reduced margin by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent warmer than average but contributed million to margin in based on weather that was percent warmer than average 
the decoupling mechanism contributed million to margin in  after adjusting margin for expected price elasticity in the annual oregon pga filing  compared to a contribution of million in residential and commercial sales the primary factors that impact results of operations in the residential and commercial markets are seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service territory 
compared to volumes sold were percent higher  primarily reflecting percent customer growth in the residential and commercial sector and improved economic conditions  partially offset by percent warmer weather  operating revenues were percent higher  primarily due to a percent increase in volumes and an percent increase in the average rate per therm due to recent pga rate increases  effective october  and november   and margin was percent higher  reflecting customer growth and higher gas cost savings from our pga incentive sharing mechanism in oregon see cost of gas  below 
compared to volumes sold were percent higher  including unbilled sales  reflecting the impact of percent customer growth and percent colder weather partially offset by declining average consumption due to customer conservation  operating revenues were percent higher  primarily due to a percent increase in volumes and an percent increase in the average rate per therm due to the pga rate increases  effective october  and  and  margin was percent higher reflecting customer growth and increases in gas cost savings from our pga incentive sharing mechanism in oregon see cost of gas  below 
typically  percent or more of annual utility operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
although variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to these customers  the effect on margin and net income is significantly reduced with the weather normalization mechanism in oregon see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
beginning in  this mechanism is effective from december through may of each heating season 
approximately percent of our residential and commercial customers are in washington  where the mechanism is not in effect  and about percent of our eligible oregon customers have voluntarily elected not to be covered by the mechanism  so the mechanism does not fully insulate us from earnings volatility due to weather 
the mechanism increased margin by a net million in the twelve month period ended december   decreased margin by million in and increased margin by million in 
table of contents industrial sales and transportation the primary factors that impact results of operations in the industrial sales and transportation markets are commodity costs  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service territory 
compared to volumes delivered to industrial customers increased million therms  or percent  with the increase primarily in lower margin interruptible schedules  operating revenue decreased million  or percent  due to customers transferring from sales service to transportation service where cost of gas is not a component in operating revenues  and margin increased percent  reflecting increased volumes 
compared to volumes delivered to industrial customers decreased million therms  or less than percent  operating revenue increased million  or percent  reflecting a percent increase in sales volumes due to customers that migrated from transportation to sales service where the cost of gas component is included in revenues and to rate increases effective october  and  and margin increased percent due to the migration of customers to higher margin rate schedules  partially offset by lower volumes 
several large industrial customers transferred from sales service back to transportation service in in  high natural gas prices resulted in a number of our large industrial customers switching from transportation service  where they arrange for their own supplies through independent third parties  to sales service where we sell them the gas commodity under regulatory tariffs 
our tariff requires us to charge the incremental cost of gas supply incurred to serve those customers 
other revenues other revenues include miscellaneous fee income as well as revenue adjustments reflecting deferrals to  or amortizations from  regulatory asset or liability accounts other than deferrals relating to gas costs 
other revenues increased net operating revenues by million in  compared to million in and million in compared to other revenues in were million lower than in primarily due a million decrease in deferrals under the decoupling mechanism see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above and a million increase in amortization of the decoupling deferrals from prior periods  partially offset by an increase of million in interstate gas storage credits to customers reflecting increased net income from storage operations  a decrease of million in amortization expense for the south mist pipeline extension and a decrease of million in the deferral for the oregon income tax kicker refund 

table of contents compared to in  other revenues were million lower than in primarily due to a million decrease in interstate gas storage credits to customers resulting from lower net income from storage operations and the deferral of million for the oregon income tax kicker refund  partially offset by a million increase in customer late payment fees and a special enhanced service contract and a million increase in deferrals under the decoupling mechanism see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
cost of gas sold natural gas commodity prices have risen significantly in recent years 
the effects of higher commodity prices and price volatility on core utility customers are mitigated  in part  through our use of underground storage facilities  fixed price commodity hedge contracts and short term sales of excess gas supply and transportation capacity to off system customers in periods when core utility customers do not require the full amount of contract gas supplies or firm pipeline capacity 
the total cost of gas sold was million in  an increase of million or percent compared to  and cost of gas sold in was million  an increase of million or percent higher than the cost per therm of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains or losses from commodity hedges  margin from off system gas sales  pipeline demand charges  seasonal demand cost balancing adjustments  regulatory gas cost deferrals and company gas use 
under the pga tariff in oregon  our net income is affected within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above 
in each of the last three years  our actual gas costs were lower than the gas costs embedded in rates  with the effect that our share of the cost savings increased margin by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we use a natural gas commodity price hedge program under the terms of our financial derivatives policy to help manage our exposure to floating price gas purchase contracts see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  above  and note 
we realized net losses of million from our financial hedges in  compared to gains of million and million in and  respectively 
gains and losses from the financial hedging of utility gas purchases generally are included in cost of gas  which are factored into our pga deferrals and annual rate changes  but to the extent that any utility gas hedge is entered into after the annual pga filing  then the gains and losses are subject to our pga incentive sharing mechanism with percent deferred and percent recorded to current income 
business segments other than local gas distribution gas storage we earned million in net income from our non utility gas storage business segment in  after regulatory sharing and income taxes  equivalent to cents a share  compared to million or cents a share in and million or cents a share in see note 
earnings from this business segment were higher in primarily because of increased net revenues 
table of contents from interstate storage service contracts and our contract with an independent energy marketing company that optimizes the value of our utility assets 
in oregon  we retain percent of the pre tax income from gas storage as well as from third party optimization revenues when the costs of the capacity used have not been included in utility rates  or percent of the pre tax income from such storage and optimization when the capacity costs have been included in utility rates 
the remaining percent and percent  respectively  are credited to a deferred regulatory account for crediting to our core utility customers 
we have a similar sharing mechanism in washington for pre tax income derived from storage services and third party optimization 
other net income from our other non regulated investment activities was million in both and and million in in  we recognized net income of million from financial corporation  and we completed the sale of a non utility real estate investment that contributed a million gain  before tax 
also in  we recognized an additional million from a real estate transaction where the property was sold on an installment basis  and we reclassified our investment in a boeing aircraft to current assets due to the lease term expiration in and our expectation that the asset will be sold prior to year end 
subsidiaries financial corporation operating results in were net income of million  compared to million in and million in our investment in financial corporation was million at december   compared to million at december  operating expenses operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses increased by million in  or percent  compared to and increased million  or percent  in compared to the following summarizes the major factors that contributed to changes in operations and maintenance expense compared to a million increase in payroll expense  primarily due to bonuses related to improved results on annual performance goals and an increase in the long term incentive plan liability due to a higher total shareholder return than our peer group average on which the award is based  a million increase in severance expenses related to the severance incentive plan  and a million increase in stock option expense due to the required adoption of sfas no 
r related to stock based compensation expense see note 

table of contents partially offsetting the above increases were a million decrease in system damages and damage claims written off  and a million reduction in charges related to a settlement with a group of industrial customers in compared to a million increase in regular payroll related expense resulting from employee additions  pay increases and higher benefit costs  a million increase in bonus payroll expense related to improved results on performance goals and an increase in the accrued long term incentive plan liability due to a higher stock price on which the award is based  a million charge related to a settlement with a group of industrial customers  a million increase in system damages and damage claims written off  a million increase related to employee severance charges  a million increase in costs for software maintenance  and a million increase in costs for consumer safety advertising 
partially offsetting the above increases was a million decrease in uncollectible accounts expense reflecting improved collection results and cash recoveries of accounts previously written off 
some of the cost increases we experienced in over were included in the rates approved in our general rate cases in oregon and washington see regulatory matters general rate cases  above 
general taxes general taxes  which are principally comprised of property and payroll taxes  increased million  or percent  in compared to  and increased million  or percent  in compared to payroll taxes decreased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to in  payroll taxes included an accrual for taxes on the bonuses paid in property taxes increased million in and million in primarily due to increased utility plant in service 
regulatory fees increased by million or percent in compared to due to higher utility operating revenues 
increases in regulatory fees are generally recovered on a timely basis through an increase in customer rates through the annual pga filing 

table of contents depreciation and amortization the following table summarizes the increases in total plant and property and total depreciation and amortization for the three years ended december thousands plant and property utility plant depreciable non depreciable  including construction work in progress non utility property depreciable non depreciable  including construction work in progress total plant and property depreciation and amortization utility plant non utility property total depreciation and amortization expense average depreciation rate utility average depreciation rate non utility total depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or percent  in and by million  or percent  in the increased expense for both years is primarily due to additional investments in utility plant to meet continuing customer growth and to make system improvements see financial condition cash flows investing activities  below  and note 
we recently completed a depreciation study on all company plant and property  which generally indicates that depreciation rates overall would be reduced if we maintain the existing average service life depreciation method 
however  if the opuc were to adopt a different depreciation method such as the equal life group method  then depreciation rates could increase 
utility depreciation rates and methods are subject to review and approval by the opuc and wutc  and new rates will not be placed into service until depreciation rate proceedings are approved 
we intend to submit the depreciation study for regulatory approval in and implement the new rates upon approval 
we do not anticipate that adoption of these new rates will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents other income and expense net the following table provides details on other income and expense net for the last three years thousands gains from company owned life insurance allowance for funds used during construction equity interest income other non operating expenses net interest on deferred regulatory accounts earnings from equity investments of financial corporation total other income other income and expense net improved by million in over the increase was primarily due to higher gains of million from company owned life insurance  reflecting higher policy benefits realized during  and a net decrease of million in other non operating expenses  reflecting cost reduction initiatives 
these positive changes were partially offset by a million increase in net interest charges on deferred regulatory accounts  reflecting higher net credit balances outstanding in these accounts 
other income and expense net was million lower in compared to the decrease was primarily due to million lower gains from company owned life insurance  reflecting the liquidation of million in cash surrender value of policies in  and the absence of the equity component in the allowance for funds used during construction afudc reflecting lower construction work in progress balances 
interest charges net of amounts capitalized interest charges net of amounts capitalized in was million  or percent  higher than in  reflecting higher interest rates on short term debt balances and slightly higher average balances of long term debt outstanding during the period due to the issuance of million in june and million in december afudc reduced interest expense by million in  compared to reductions of million in and million in the increase in afudc in reflects higher construction work in progress balances 
the decrease in afudc in reflects lower balances due to the completion in of our major south mist pipeline extension project  which extended the pipeline from our mist gas storage field to serve growing portions of our service area 
the average interest crediting rate for afudc  comprised of short term and long term borrowing rates  as appropriate  was percent in  percent in and percent in income tax expense income tax expense totaled million in compared to million in the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the higher effective tax rate partially reflects the expiration of a federal tax credit associated with financial corporation s investment in a low income housing project see note  other and non taxable life insurance gains 
income tax expense increased by million in  as compared to total income tax expense of million in  and the effective tax rate increased percent from an effective tax rate of percent in the higher effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a decrease in tax benefits of million resulting from a non taxable gain on company owned life insurance in and from million in other tax adjustments recorded in

financial condition capital structure our goal is to maintain a target capital structure comprised of to percent common stock equity and to percent long term and short term debt 
when additional capital is required  debt or equity securities are issued depending upon both the target capital structure and market conditions 
these sources also are used to meet long term debt redemption requirements and short term commercial paper maturities see liquidity and capital resources  below  and notes  and 
our consolidated capital structure was as follows december  common stock equity long term debt short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt total achieving the target capital structure and maintaining sufficient liquidity are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings and have access to capital markets at reasonable costs 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  short term liquidity is provided by cash from operations and from the sale of commercial paper notes  which are supported by committed bank lines of credit 
we have available committed bank lines totaling million with five commercial banks through september  see lines of credit  below  and note 
short term debt balances typically are reduced toward the end of the winter heating season as a significant amount of our current assets  primarily accounts receivable and gas inventories  are converted into cash 
capital expenditures primarily relate to utility construction resulting from customer growth and system improvements see cash flows investing activities  below 
certain contractual commitments under capital leases  operating leases  gas supply purchase contracts and other contracts require an adequate source of funding 
these capital and contractual expenditures are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
to provide long term financing  we periodically issue and sell secured or unsecured debt  preferred stock or common stock 
in april  we issued million of common stock and in june and december  we issued million and million of secured medium term notes  respectively 
at december   we had million available for future issuance of debt or equity securities under a universal shelf registration  which was previously approved by the opuc see financing activities  below 

table of contents neither our mortgage and deed of trust nor the indenture under which other long term debt may be issued contain credit rating triggers or stock price provisions that require the acceleration of debt repayment 
also  there are no rating triggers or stock price provisions contained in contracts or other agreements with third parties  except for agreements with certain counterparties under our financial derivatives policy  which may require the affected party to provide substitute collateral such as cash  guaranty or letters of credit if credit ratings are lowered to non investment grade  or in some cases if the mark to market value exceeds a certain threshold 
based on the availability of short term credit facilities and our expectation of being able to issue long term debt and equity securities  we believe there is sufficient liquidity to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements  including the contractual obligations and investing and financing activities discussed below 
dividend policy we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock in each year since the stock first was issued to the public in annual common dividend payments have increased each year since the amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock are within the sole discretion of our board of directors 
it is the intention of the board of directors to continue to pay cash dividends on common stock on a quarterly basis 
however  the declarations and amounts of future dividends will be dependent upon our earnings  cash flows  financial condition and other factors 
off balance sheet arrangements except for certain lease and purchase commitments see contractual obligations  below  we have no material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table shows our contractual obligations by maturity and type of obligation 
payments due in years ending december  thousands thereafter total commercial paper long term debt maturities interest on long term debt pension funding obligation postretirement funding obligation capital leases operating leases gas purchase contracts gas pipeline commitments other purchase commitments total all gas purchase contract use price formulas tied to monthly index prices 
commitment amounts are based on index prices at december  
table of contents other purchase commitments primarily consist of remaining balances under existing purchase orders 
these and other contractual obligations are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
holders of certain long term debt have put options that  if exercised  would require repurchases of up to million principal amount in each of  and if repurchased prior to maturity  then the interest obligation shown in the above table would be reduced in future years 
the interest rate on the long term debt issues with put options ranges between percent and percent 
in march  our employees who are members of the office and professional employees international union  local no 
 approved a labor agreement joint accord covering wages  benefits and working conditions 
this contract will expire on may  commercial paper our primary source of short term funds is from the sale of commercial paper notes 
in addition to issuing commercial paper to meet seasonal working capital requirements  including the financing of gas inventories and accounts receivable  short term debt may also be used to temporarily fund capital requirements 
commercial paper is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
our commercial paper program is supported by committed bank lines of credit see lines of credit  below 
we had million in commercial paper notes outstanding at december   compared to million at december  lines of credit in september  we entered into agreements for unsecured lines of credit totaling million with five commercial banks  replacing the former million credit facilities 
the bank lines of credit are available and committed for a term of five years from october  to september  our bank lines are used primarily as back up support for the notes payable under our commercial paper borrowing program 
commercial paper provides the liquidity to meet our working capital and external financing requirements 
under the terms of these bank lines  we pay upfront fees and annual commitment fees but are not required to maintain compensating bank balances 
the interest rates on outstanding loans  if any  under these bank lines are based on then current market interest rates 
all principal and unpaid interest under the bank lines is due and payable on september  the bank lines require that we maintain credit ratings with standard poor s rating services s p and moody s investors service moody s and notify the banks of any change in our senior unsecured debt ratings by such rating agencies 
a change in our credit rating is not an event of default  nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of credit rating a condition of drawing upon the bank lines 
however  interest rates on any loans outstanding under these bank lines are tied to our credit ratings  which would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the bank lines when ratings are changed 
the bank lines also require us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of percent or less 
failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the banks to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding 
we were in compliance with this covenant at december  and 
table of contents credit ratings the table below summarizes our credit ratings from two rating agencies  s p and moody s 
s p moody s commercial paper short term debt a p senior secured long term debt aa a senior unsecured long term debt a a ratings outlook stable stable on february   s p raised the credit ratings on our senior secured long term debt to aa from a and our senior unsecured long term debt to a from a 
s p also raised the credit ratings on commercial paper to a from a both of the rating agencies have assigned us an investment grade rating 
these credit ratings and ratings outlook are dependent upon a number of factors  both qualitative and quantitative  and are subject to change at any time 
the disclosure of these credit ratings is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold our securities 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
in august  we elected to discontinue the credit rating service from fitch ratings fitch for cost management reasons 
at the time this service was cancelled  fitch had assigned an a rating to our secured long term debt  an a rating to our unsecured long term debt and an f rating to our commercial paper program 
also  the ratings outlook from fitch was stable 
redemptions of long term debt in june  we redeemed million of secured series b medium term notes mtns at maturity 
in july  we redeemed three series of maturing secured mtns aggregating million in principal amount 
the series redeemed were the series b  the series b and the series b  each due in july the notes were redeemed with proceeds from the sales of million in principal amount of secured mtns in june see cash flows financing activities  below 
in august  we called for redemption all of our outstanding convertible debentures  series due  at percent of their principal amount plus accrued interest to the date of redemption 
during  debentures with an aggregate principal amount of million were converted into shares of common stock on or prior to the redemption date at the rate of shares for each  principal amount of debentures and million of debentures were redeemed 
cash flows operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily affected by net income  changes in working capital requirements and other cash and non cash adjustments to operating results 
in  our cash flow from net income and operating activity adjustments  excluding working capital changes  increased by million  primarily due to a million decrease in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and a million increase in cash collections from deferred gas costs and improved operating results  partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax benefits reflecting the expiration of higher tax benefits realized in from accelerated bonus 
table of contents depreciation

we have met the first major milestones required by the act and are on track to complete the next milestone  inspection of the highest risk percent of our transmission pipelines  by the end of financing activities cash used in financing activities in totaled million  as compared to cash provided by financing in of million 
factors contributing to the million net change were the net change in short term debt million  a lower amount of long term debt issued during million and the lower amount of equity financing in million  partially offset by a smaller redemption of long term debt in compared to million 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million  compared to million in factors contributing to the million decrease were the redemption of long term debt and convertible debentures million  the increased repurchases of common stock in million and the lower amount of equity financing in million  partially offset by the issuance of million of secured mtns during and the net change in short term debt million 
in december  we sold million of series b  secured mtns due and used the proceeds to reduce short term indebtedness and to fund utility construction 
in  we sold million of series b  secured mtns due and million of series b  secured mtns due  and used the proceeds to redeem long term debt  to reduce short term indebtedness and to make investments in utility plant 
in april  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering  and used the net proceeds of million to reduce short term indebtedness and to fund  in part  our utility construction program 

table of contents in  we announced a program to repurchase up to million shares  or up to million in value  of our common stock through a repurchase program  and in that program was modified to million shares and million in value and extended through may the purchases are made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
repurchases pursuant to the program in totaled  shares or million and in were  shares  or million 
no shares were purchased pursuant to the program in since the program s inception  we have repurchased  shares of common stock at a total cost of million see part ii  item  market for the registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  above 
in  we produced free cash flow of million  compared to and when we had negative free cash flows of million and million  respectively 
free cash flow is the amount of cash left over after the payment of all cash expenses  capital expenditures investment activities and dividends 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  but we believe this supplemental information enables the reader of the financial statements to better understand our cash generating ability and to benefit from seeing cash flow results from management s perspective in addition to the traditional gaap presentation 
we monitor free cash flow as one measure of our return on investments 
provided below is a reconciliation from cash provided by operations gaap basis to our non gaap free cash flow 
thousands year ended december cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash divided payments on common stock free cash flow the free cash flow information presented above is not intended to be a substitute for  nor is it meant to be a better measure of  cash flow results prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  the non gaap measure we provide may be calculated differently by other companies that present a similar non gaap financial measure for free cash flow 
pension cost and funding status of qualified retirement plans pension costs are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions  above 
pension costs are allocated between operations and maintenance expense and capital accounts based on employee payroll distributions 
pension costs for our two qualified defined benefit pension plans totaled million in  an increase of million over the increase in pension costs was primarily due to the lower discount rate percent in compared to percent in and the adoption of new mortality rate assumptions as of december  we make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarial assumptions and estimates  tax regulations and funding requirements under federal law 
generally  it is our policy to contribute at least the minimum amount required by internal revenue code regulations and the employee retirement income security act of it is also our intent to contribute additional 
table of contents amounts sufficient on a sound actuarial basis to maintain funding targets and provide for the payment of future benefits under the plans 
during  we contributed million to our two qualified defined benefit plans  but no additional contributions were made to these plans in although we were not required to make cash contributions in either or based on minimum funding requirements  we contributed to these plans in to maintain a target funding level based on plan benefit obligations 
the fair market value of the assets in these two plans increased to million at december   up from million at december  the increase included million in investment gains  which were offset in part by million in withdrawals to pay benefits and million in eligible expenses of the two plans 
the present value of benefit obligations under the two plans increased from million at december  to million at december  the two qualified defined benefit pension plans were underfunded in aggregate by approximately million at december  pension costs for the plans totaled million in  compared to million in the increase in pension costs in was primarily due to the lower discount rate percent in compared to percent in  partially offset by higher earnings on additional cash contributions to the plans 
at december   the fair market value of the qualified defined benefit pension plans assets totaled million  up from million at december  the increase included million in investment gains and employer contributions of million  which were offset in part by million in withdrawals to pay benefits and million in eligible expenses of the two plans 
the present value of benefit obligations under the two plans increased from million to million during  primarily due to the adoption of a new mortality table to reflect the increased life expectancies of plan participants 
the two plans were underfunded in aggregate by about million at december  despite the increase in pension costs and the current underfunded status of the plans  we believe the plans to be adequately funded and that we will be able to continue to maintain appropriate funding levels 
the annualized returns for the past one  five and years ended december  were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we do not expect our current or future cash contribution requirements to the two plans to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or financial condition see note 
effective january   we closed our non bargaining unit plan to newly hired or rehired employees 
ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended december   and  our ratios of earnings to fixed charges  computed using the securities and exchange commission method  were  and  respectively 
for this purpose  earnings consist of net income before taxes plus fixed charges  and fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness  the amortization of debt expense and discount or premium and the estimated interest portion of rentals charged to income 

table of contents contingent liabilities loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  see application of critical accounting policies and estimates contingencies  above 
at december   a cumulative million in environmental costs was recorded as a regulatory asset  including million of costs paid to date and million of estimated accrued future environmental costs 
if it is determined that both the insurance recovery and future customer rate recovery of such costs is not probable  then the costs will be charged to expense in the period such determination is made 
for further discussion of contingent liabilities  see note item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity supply risk  weather risk and interest rate risk 
the following describes our exposure to these risks 
commodity supply risk we enter into short term  medium term and long term natural gas supply contracts  along with associated short  medium and long term transportation capacity contracts 
historically  we have taken physical delivery of at least the minimum quantities specified in our natural gas supply contracts 
these contracts are primarily index based and subject to annual re pricing  a process that is intended to reflect anticipated market price trends during the next year 
our pga mechanisms in oregon and washington provide for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs  except that  for oregon customers  we absorb percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retain percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to the annual pga price built into customer rates 
market risks related to potential adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign exchange rates or counterparty credit quality in relation to these financial and physical contracts are discussed below 
commodity price risk natural gas commodity prices are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
commodity price swap and call option contracts financial hedge contracts are used to convert certain natural gas supply contracts from floating prices to fixed prices 
these financial hedge contracts are generally included in our annual pga filing  subject to a prudency review 
at december  and  notional amounts under these commodity swap and call option contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
if all of the commodity price swap and call option contracts had been settled on december   a regulatory loss of million would have been realized and deferred see note 
we monitor the liquidity of our financial derivative contracts 
based on the existing open interest in the contracts held  we believe existing contracts to be liquid 
all of our financial derivative contracts settle within the next two years 
the million unrealized loss is an estimate of future cash flows that are expected to be paid as follows million in and million in the amount realized will change based on market prices at the time contract settlements are fixed 
foreign currency risk the costs of certain natural gas commodity supplies and certain pipeline services purchased from canadian suppliers are subject to changes in the value of the canadian currency in relation to the us currency 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations in exchange 
table of contents rates with respect to the purchases of natural gas from canadian suppliers 
at december  and  notional amounts under foreign currency forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
as of december   no foreign currency forward contracts extended beyond december  if all of the foreign currency forward contracts had been settled on december   a loss of million would have been realized see note 
credit risk credit exposure to suppliers 
certain suppliers that sell us gas have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
to manage this supply risk  we purchase gas from a number of different suppliers  with no single supplier accounting for more than percent of our total purchases for a given monthly period 
we evaluate and continuously monitor suppliers creditworthiness and maintain the ability to require additional financial assurances  including deposits  letters of credit or surety bonds in case a supplier defaults 
in the event of a supplier s failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas  the regulated utility would need to replace those volumes at prevailing market prices  which may be higher or lower than the original transaction prices 
we believe these costs would be subject to the pga sharing mechanism discussed above 
since most of our commodity supply contracts are priced at the monthly market index price  and we have significant storage flexibility  we believe that it is unlikely that a supplier default would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties 
based on estimated fair value  our credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties relating to commodity swap and call option contracts was a negative million at december  our financial derivatives policy requires counterparties to have a minimum credit rating at the time the derivative instrument is entered into  and the policy specifies limits on the contract amount and duration based on each counterparty s credit rating 
there were no credit rating downgrades for any of our counterparties during the following table summarizes our credit exposure  based on estimated fair value  and the corresponding counterparty credit ratings 
the table uses credit ratings from s p and moody s  reflecting the higher of s p or moody s rating  or a middle rating if the entity is split rated more than one rating level financial derivative position by credit rating unrealized fair value gain loss thousands dec

 aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa total credit exposure to customers 
increases in the price of natural gas are expected to increase our credit exposure to customers 
however  in the short term  market prices have moderated and resulted in some of our large industrial customers changing from sales services to transportation service 
under sales service  the customer purchases both its gas commodity supply and transportation service from us 
under transportation service  the customer purchases its commodity supplies from an independent third party  with us only providing the transportation service for delivery of that gas to the customer s premise 
as a result of this migration from sales service to transportation service  our credit exposure to large industrial customers is expected to moderate 
we monitor and manage the credit exposure of 
table of contents our industrial customers through credit policies and procedures  which are designed to reduce credit risk 
these policies and procedures include an ongoing review of credit risks  including changes in the services provided to industrial customers as well as changes in market conditions and customers credit quality 
changes in credit risk may require us to obtain additional assurance  such as deposits  letters of credit  guarantees and prepayments to reduce our credit exposure 
we also monitor and manage the credit exposure of our residential and commercial customers 
this credit risk is largely mitigated by the nature of our regulated business and reasonably short collection terms  as well as by the consistent application of our credit policies and procedures 
weather risk we are exposed to weather risk primarily from our regulated utility business 
a large percentage of our utility margin is volume driven  and current rates are based on an assumption of average weather 
in  the opuc approved a weather normalization mechanism for residential and commercial customers 
this mechanism affects customer bills between december through may of each winter heating season  increasing or decreasing the margin component of customers rates to reflect average weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize the recovery of our utility s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
customers in oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism 
as of december   about percent of our oregon customers had opted out 
in addition to the oregon customers opting out  our washington residential and commercial customers account for approximately percent of our total customer base and are not covered by weather normalization 
the combination of oregon and washington customers not covered by a weather normalization mechanism is less than percent of all residential and commercial customers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including future contractual obligations and maturities of long term and short term debt 
interest rate risk is managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities 
we may also enter into financial derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  locks  options and other hedge products  to manage and mitigate interest rate exposure 
at december  and  we had no variable rate long term debt and no financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rates 
holders of certain long term debt have put options that  if exercised  would accelerate maturities by million in each of  and see note and note
