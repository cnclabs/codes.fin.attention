item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading provider of advanced digital satellite communications and other wireless and secure networking and signal processing equipment and services to the government and commercial markets 
based on our history and extensive experience in complex defense communications systems  we have developed the capability to design and implement innovative communications solutions  which enhance bandwidth utilization by applying our sophisticated networking and digital signal processing techniques 
our goal is to leverage our advanced technology and capabilities to capture a considerable share of the secure networking and global satellite communications 
table of contents equipment and services segment of the broadband communications market for both government and commercial customers 
our internal growth to date has historically been driven largely by our success in meeting the need for advanced communications products for our government and commercial customers 
by developing cost effective communications solutions incorporating our advanced technologies  we have continued to grow the markets for our products and services 
our company is organized principally in two segments government and commercial 
our government business encompasses specialized products principally serving defense customers and includes data links  including mids terminals  mids jtrs development and unmanned vehicle technologies  information security and assurance products and services  which enable military and government users to communicate secure information over secure and non secure networks  and government satellite communication systems and products  including uhf dama satellite communications products consisting of modems  terminals and network control systems  and innovative broadband solutions to government customers to increase available bandwidth using existing satellite capacity 
serving government customers with cost effective products and solutions continues to be a critical and core element of our overall business strategy 
the commercial segment comprises two business product groups satellite networks and antenna systems 
our commercial business offers an end to end capability to provide customers with a broad range of satellite communication and other wireless communications equipment solutions including consumer broadband products and solutions to customers based on docsis or dvb rcs based technology  mobile broadband products and systems for in flight  maritime and ground mobile broadband applications  enterprise vsat networks products and services  satellite networking systems design and technology development  and antenna systems for commercial and defense applications and customers 
with expertise in commercial satellite network engineering  gateway construction  and remote terminal manufacturing for all types of interactive communications services  we have the ability to take overall responsibility for designing  building  initially operating  and then handing over a fully operational  customized satellite network serving a variety of markets and applications 
in recent years approximately one half of our revenues has been generated from satellite based communications products and systems solutions to address commercial market needs 
our commercial business accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal year  of our revenues in fiscal year and of our revenues in fiscal year to date  our principal commercial offerings include satellite communication terminals  known as very small aperture terminals vsats  broadband internet equipment over satellite  network control systems  network integration services  network operation services  satellite system design gateway infrastructure  antenna systems and other satellite ground stations 
in addition  based on our advanced satellite technology and systems integration experience  we have developed products addressing five key broadband markets enterprise  consumer  in flight  maritime and ground mobile applications 
to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution  and obtaining additional sizable contract awards 
due to the nature of this process  it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets 
our products are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
historically  approximately for fiscal year and for fiscal years and of our revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  which require us to provide products and services 
table of contents under a contract at a stipulated price 
the remainder of our annual revenue was derived from cost reimbursement contracts  under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit  and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues are from contracts for the research and development of products 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer s specific requirements and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also incur independent research and development expenses  which are not directly funded by a third party 
independent research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development programs 
independent research and development expenses were approximately of revenues during fiscal year and and of revenues during fiscal year as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our independent research and development expenses pursuant to our government contracts 
executive summary we develop and manufacture satellite ground systems and other related government and commercial digital communications equipment 
our products are generally highly complex and have a concept to market timeline of several months to several years 
the development of products where customers expect state of the art results requires an exceptionally talented and dedicated engineering workforce 
since inception  we have been able to attract  develop and retain engineers who support our business and customer objectives  while experiencing low turnover relative to our industry 
the consistency and depth of our engineering workforce has enabled us to develop leading edge products and solutions for our customers 
our annual awards have progressively grown from approximately million to approximately million over the past five years 
the awards growth each of the past five years and the conversion of certain of the awards has contributed to our revenue growth 
there are a number of large new business opportunities we are pursuing in fiscal year in the government segment  the opportunities include the mids lvt lot viii production order  international mids lvt orders  new mids joint tactical radio system development and pre production contracts  additional funding for current information assurance projects  new information assurance contracts using our haipe technology  and orders for our kg and kg products 
in our commercial segment  the opportunities include new production orders for existing and new consumer and mobile broadband systems and equipment  and further penetration in the north american market for enterprise vsat and antenna systems 
the probability and timing of these orders is not entirely predictable  so our revenue may vary somewhat from quarter to quarter or even year to year 
generating positive cash flows from operating activities was a financial priority for us in fiscal years and and will continue to be a focus in fiscal year key areas we monitor to achieve cash flow objectives include generating income from operations  reducing our unbilled accounts receivable by monitoring program performance  reducing the cycle time for amounts billed to customers and their related collection  and reducing inventory on hand as a percentage of sales 
we expect that our capital needs for fiscal year will be similar to fiscal year in fiscal years and  we initiated and completed facility expansion and modernization projects in carlsbad  california and gilbert  arizona  as well as expanded our production test equipment and lab development equipment and information technology to meet customer program requirements and growth forecasts 
in fiscal year  we have additional facility projects planned in carlsbad  california  as well as production test equipment and information technology projects to support our growth needs 
our facility needs have normally been met with long term lease agreements  
table of contents but we do anticipate additional tenant improvements over the next two fiscal years associated with our expansion 
additionally  as our employee base increases  the need for additional computers and other equipment will also increase 
included in fiscal year operating cash flow is million we received as a result of a settlement with xetron 
operating income for fiscal year includes a benefit to cost of revenues of million related to this settlement 
on december   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of efficient channel coding ecc  a privately held designer and supplier of broadband communication integrated circuits and satellite communication systems 
the initial purchase price of approximately million was comprised primarily of million in cash consideration   in direct acquisition costs and  related to the fair value of options exchanged at the closing date 
the million of cash consideration less cash acquired of approximately  resulted in a net cash outlay of approximately million 
under the terms of the ecc acquisition agreement up to an additional million in consideration is payable in cash and or stock at our option on or prior to the eighteen month anniversary of the closing date based on ecc meeting certain financial performance targets 
on may   we agreed to pay the maximum additional consideration amount to the former ecc stockholders in the amount of million 
the million is payable in cash or stock  at our option  in may additional purchase price consideration of million was recorded as additional satellite networks goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal year we have recorded million in identifiable intangible assets and million in goodwill based on the fair values and the final allocation of purchase price of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of ecc from the date of acquisition in our satellite networks product line in the commercial segment 
we believe the acquisition of ecc was beneficial to viasat because of ecc s complimentary technologies  namely dvb s and asic design capabilities  customers and highly skilled workforce 
the potential opportunities these benefits provide to our satellite networks product group in our commercial segment were among the factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill 
the intangible assets and goodwill recognized will be deductible for federal income tax purposes 
on june   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of enerdyne technologies enerdyne  a privately held provider of innovative data link equipment and digital video systems for defense and intelligence markets  including unmanned aerial vehicle and other airborne and ground based applications 
the initial purchase price of approximately million was comprised primarily of million related to the fair value of  shares of our common stock issued at the closing date   in cash consideration  and  in direct acquisition costs 
the million of cash consideration paid to the former enerdyne stockholders and the transaction expenses paid less cash acquired of  resulted in a net cash outlay of approximately  at june   under the terms of the enerdyne acquisition agreement  up to an additional million in consideration was payable in cash and stock based on enerdyne achieving certain earnings performance in any fiscal year up to and including our fiscal year as well as projected earnings performance for the one year period thereafter 
no portion of the additional consideration was guaranteed 
as of march   enerdyne achieved financial results entitling the former stockholders of enerdyne to million of additional consideration 
accordingly  on may   we issued  shares of common stock and  in cash to the former enerdyne stockholders in full settlement of the payable and of all additional consideration provisions 
additional purchase price consideration of million was recorded as additional government segment goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during march  a million adjustment reducing goodwill was made to the final purchase price allocation for enerdyne as certain tax matters were resolved regarding utilization of enerdyne s net operating losses nol as tax deductions in the future resulting in deferred tax asset being recorded 
at june   we recorded million in identifiable intangible assets and million in goodwill based on the fair values and the final allocation of purchase price of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of enerdyne 
in march  goodwill was subsequently increased to million as a result of the additional consideration and adjustment to the final purchase price allocation for certain tax matters 
the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements include the operating results of enerdyne from the date of acquisition in our unmanned aerial vehicle uav products in the government segment 
we believe the acquisition of enerdyne is complementary to us because we will benefit from their technology  namely unmanned analog and digital video data link capabilities  existing relationships in the uav market  customers and highly skilled workforce 
the potential opportunities these benefits provide to our uav products in our government segment were among the factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill 
the intangible assets and goodwill recognized will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes 
on february   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of intelligent compression technologies ict  a privately held provider to corporations  internet service providers isps  and satellite wireless carriers of data compression techniques  advanced transport protocols  and application optimization to increase the speeds of either narrowband or broadband terrestrial  wireless  or satellite services 
the initial purchase price of approximately million was comprised primarily of million related to the fair value of  shares of our common stock issued at the closing date  million in cash consideration  and approximately  in direct acquisition costs 
the million in cash consideration paid to the former ict stockholders plus approximately  in direct acquisition costs less cash acquired of  resulted in a net cash outlay of approximately million 
under the terms of the ict acquisition agreement  up to an additional million in additional consideration is payable in cash and or stock  at our option  based on ict achieving certain earnings performance over certain month periods during the two years following closing as well as projected earnings performance for the one year period thereafter 
no portion of the additional consideration is guaranteed 
the additional consideration  if earned  is payable after the month period in which ict achieves the specified earnings performance and will be recorded as additional purchase price 
at february   we recorded million in identifiable intangible assets and million in goodwill based on the fair values and the preliminary allocation of purchase price of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of ict from the date of acquisition in our satellite networks product line in the commercial segment 
the acquisition of ict is beneficial to viasat because it adds leading edge compression and wide area network acceleration technologies 
the ict accelenet family of products speeds web browsing and accelerates leading office applications  while simultaneously reducing network congestion 
these benefits may extend to our consumer  enterprise  or government customers 
the potential opportunities these benefits provide to our products were among the factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill 
the intangible assets and goodwill recognized will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes 
the purchase price allocation is preliminary due to resolution of certain ict tax attributes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over time and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting under the american institute 
table of contents of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
sales and earnings under these contracts are recorded based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract or as products are shipped under the units of delivery method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
in the fiscal years ended march   march  and april   we recorded losses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  related to loss contracts 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and future cost estimates or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
we believe that we have established appropriate systems and processes to enable us to reasonably estimate future cost on our programs through regular quarterly evaluations of contract costs  scheduling and technical matters by business unit personnel and management 
historically  in the aggregate  we have not experienced significant deviations in actual costs from estimated program costs  and when deviations that result in significant adjustments arise  we disclose the related impact in management s discussion and analysis 
however  a significant change in future cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on our results of operations 
for example  a one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed price contracts as of march  would change our pre tax income by approximately  we also have contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products in accordance with sab  staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
in this situation  contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment  and assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value in accordance with eitf   accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements  and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
accounting for stock based compensation at march   we had stock based compensation plans described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we grant options to purchase our common stock and award restricted stock units to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month offering period under our employee stock purchase plan 
the benefits provided under these plans are stock based payments subject to the 
table of contents provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas r  share based payment 
effective april   we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of fas r with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for estimating the value of stock based compensation 
the valuation provisions of fas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date  which are subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
stock based compensation expense recognized under fas r for the fiscal year ended march  was million  million and  for employee stock options including stock options assumed in business combination  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan  respectively 
at march   there was million  million and  remaining in unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan  respectively  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  years and less than six months  respectively 
upon adoption of fas r  we began estimating the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of fas r  the value of all stock based awards was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model as well for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under fas the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of fas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under fas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate stock based compensation under fas r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our stock based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee stock based awards is determined in accordance with fas r and the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
estimates of stock based compensation expense can be significant to our financial statements  but this expense is based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
the guidance in fas r and sab is relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
theoretical valuation models and market based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for stock based compensation 
the timing  readiness  adoption  general acceptance  reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain 
sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical 
table of contents information  modeling expertise  financial analyses  correlation analyses  integrated software and databases  consulting fees  customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls 
market based methods are emerging that  if employed by us  may dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative expenses 
the uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the benefits to investors 
our expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate 
the estimated volatility for stock options and employee stock purchase rights is based on the historical volatility calculated using the daily stock price of our stock over a recent historical period equal to the expected term 
the risk free interest rate that we use in determining the fair value of our stock based awards is based on the implied yield on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term of our stock based awards 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the calculation using the simplified method for plain vanilla options applied consistently to all plain vanilla options  consistent with the guidance in sab we expect to replace the simplified method with the historical data method for the valuation of shares granted after december   as more detailed information becomes readily available to us  consistent with the guidance in sab the weighted average expected life of employee stock options granted during the fiscal year ended march  derived from the simplified method was years 
the expected term or life of employee stock purchase rights issued represents the expected period of time from the date of grant to the estimated date that the stock purchase right under our employee stock purchase plan would be fully exercised 
in fiscal year  we recorded total stock compensation expense of million of which  related to stock options issued at acquisition of ecc and million was recorded upon the acceleration of vesting of certain employee stock options 
stock compensation expense presented in the consolidated statement of operations was recorded as follows  to cost of revenue   to selling  general and administrative expense and  to independent research and development 
in fiscal year  we recorded in compensation expense 
on december   as a part of the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of ecc  we issued  unvested stock options under the efficient channel coding  inc long term incentive plan assumed under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we recorded  in deferred stock based compensation which is being amortized to compensation expense over the remaining service period 
we amortized  to compensation expense related to this deferred stock based compensation through march  review of stock option grant procedures in august we commenced and completed a voluntary internal investigation  assisted by our outside legal counsel  of our historical stock option granting practices  stock option documentation and related accounting during the period from our initial public offering in december through june  at the conclusion of our investigation  we and our outside legal counsel determined that there was no evidence of a pattern of intentionally misdating stock option grants to achieve an accounting result  or that any of our officers  directors  or senior executives willfully or knowingly engaged in stock options misdating  or had knowledge of others doing so 
during the investigation we identified certain accounting errors associated with stock options granted primarily to certain non executive new hire employees during the ten year period from december to june  based on the results of the investigation  we identified that certain stock options to non executive new hires had incorrectly been accounted for using an accounting measurement date prior to the date that the new hires commenced employment 
we concluded  with the concurrence of the audit committee  that the financial impact of these errors was not material to our consolidated financial statements for any annual period in which the errors related 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  paragraph  we recorded a cumulative adjustment to compensation expense in the first quarter of fiscal year of  net of tax  because the effect of the correcting adjustment was not material to our expected fiscal year net income 
this non cash compensation expense adjustment will have no impact on future periods 
there is no impact on revenue or net cash provided by operating activities as a result of recording the compensation expense adjustment 

table of contents option acceleration on march   our board of directors accelerated the vesting of certain unvested employee stock options previously awarded to our employees under our equity participation plan 
stock options held by our non employee directors were not accelerated 
options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock representing approximately of our total current outstanding options were subject to this acceleration 
all of the accelerated options were in the money and had exercise prices ranging from to 
all other terms and conditions applicable to such options  including the exercise prices  remain unchanged 
because the exercise price of all options subject to acceleration was lower than the fair market value of our underlying common stock on the date of acceleration  we recorded million in compensation expense 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made primarily to eliminate the recognition of the related compensation expense in our future consolidated financial statements with respect to these unvested stock options upon adopting sfas r 
we recognized a pre tax charge for estimated compensation expense of approximately million in the fiscal fourth quarter ended march  after considering expected employee turnover rates to reflect  absent the acceleration  the in the money value of accelerated stock options we estimate would have been forfeited unvested pursuant to their original terms 
the accelerated stock options are subject to lock up restrictions preventing the sale of any shares acquired through the exercise of an accelerated stock option prior to the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the stock option s original vesting terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  our bad debts have been minimal  a contributing factor to this is that a significant portion of our sales has been to the us government 
more recently  commercial customers comprise a larger part of our revenues 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of march  and our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march  warranty reserves we provide limited warranties on a majority of our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
we classify the amounts we expect to incur within twelve months as a current liability 
for mature products  we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failure that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience  and in that case  we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for our goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
the only reporting units which have goodwill assigned to them are the businesses which were acquired and have been included in our commercial segment 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value 
we base the forecast of future cash flows on our best estimate of the future revenues and operating costs  
table of contents which we derive primarily from existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could cause a particular reporting unit to either pass or fail the first step in the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model  which could significantly influence whether a goodwill impairment needs to be recorded 
we adjust the cash flow forecasts by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
in applying the first step  which is identification of any impairment of goodwill  no impairment of goodwill has resulted 
impairment of long lived assets property and equipment and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property and equipment and other intangible assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets are less than the asset s carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
we have not identified any such impairments 
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we maintained a valuation allowance of  and  against deferred tax assets at march  and march   respectively  relating to research credit carryforwards available to reduce state income taxes 
derivatives we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions 
gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in interest income expense as gains losses on derivative instruments 
gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign currency forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as gains losses on derivative instruments until the underlying transaction affects our earnings 
we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at march  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was a liability of  at march  and we had million of notional value of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at march  self insurance liabilities we self insure a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers compensation costs and employee medical benefits 
accounting for workers compensation expense and employee medical benefits require the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including ultimate severity of injuries  the timeliness of reporting injuries  and health care cost increases 
we insure for workers compensation and employee medical benefit liabilities under a large deductible program where losses are incurred up to certain specific and aggregate amounts 
accruals for claims under this self insurance program are recorded as claims are incurred 
we estimate our liability for claims incurred but not paid  including claims incurred but not recorded  based on the total incurred claims and paid claims  adjusted for ultimate losses as determined by our insurance carrier 
we evaluate the estimated liability on a continuing basis and adjust accordingly 
to date  workers compensation expense and employee medical benefits expense have been within the range of managements expectations

however  we did experience a decrease in the cost of revenues as a percent of revenues from in the prior year to in the current year 
this improvement was primarily due to product cost reductions in our consumer broadband products  which yielded cost of revenues decreases of percentage points for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year these cost reductions were offset by overall product cost of revenue increases of approximately percentage points in our government segment and approximately percentage points from our antenna systems products 
cost of revenues for the fiscal year included approximately million in stock based compensation expense and  related to the accelerated vesting of certain employee stock options in fiscal year cost of revenues may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and services provided  competition  new product introduction costs and other factors

the decrease in cost of revenues as a percent of revenues was primarily due to the margin dollars generated from higher revenues and improved program performance in the government segment over fiscal year  in particular improved profitability of mids programs and lower product sustaining costs 
cost of revenues also includes a benefit related to a legal settlement with xetron in the first quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in a net benefit to cost of revenues of million 
these increases were partially offset by cost of revenue increases from higher than planned development costs in a radio frequency micro positioning technology of million and lower vsat product margins

table of contents backlog as reflected in the table below  funded and firm funded plus unfunded backlog increased during fiscal year with increases coming from our government segment 
new contract awards in the current year increased backlog to a new all time high for us 
march  march  in millions firm backlog government segment commercial segment total funded backlog government segment commercial segment total contract options the firm backlog does not include contract options 
of the million in firm backlog  approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year  and the balance is expected to be delivered in fiscal year and thereafter 
we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 
over the last year  as more of our products have been placed into market  we have seen a greater percentage of awards from book and ship type orders 
this has resulted in backlog not growing as fast as the past three fiscal years 
total new awards for both commercial and defense products were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer since orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related purchase order 
the backlog amounts as presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although we do not control the funding of our contracts  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations  bank line of credit financing and equity financing 
the general cash needs of our government and commercial segments can vary significantly and depend on the type and mix of contracts ie product or service  development or production  and timing of payments in backlog  the quality of the customer ie ie government or commercial  domestic or international and the duration of the contract 
in addition  for both of our segments  program performance significantly impacts the timing and amount of cash flows 
if a program is performing and meeting its contractual requirements  then the cash flow requirements are usually lower 
the cash needs of the government segment tend to be more of a function of the type of contract rather than customer quality 
also  us government procurement regulations tend to restrict the timing of cash payments on the 
table of contents contract 
in the commercial segment  our cash needs are driven primarily by the quality of the customer and the type of contract 
the quality of the customer will typically affect the specific contract cash flow and whether financing instruments are required by the customer 
in addition  the commercial environment tends to provide for more flexible payment terms with customers  including advance payments 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to of million primarily related to a higher year over year net income of million  increase in adjustments to net income for non cash add backs of million and year over year reduction of operating assets and liabilities of million 
billed accounts receivable increased by million from year end due to increased shipments in both our government and commercial segments due to revenue growth and the achievement of program milestones 
unbilled accounts receivable decreased by million primarily through program performance in meeting milestones and deliverables 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million as compared to cash used in investing activities in of million 
we used  of cash for the acquisition of enerdyne  million of cash for the acquisition of ict and million of cash for capital expenditures  principally for facility expansion and production test equipment to support our growth in fiscal year compared to million for the acquisition of ecc and million for capital in fiscal year cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million as compared to cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year of million 
the majority of the activity for both years is due to cash received from the exercise of employee stock options  and stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan 
fiscal year also includes million in cash inflows related to the incremental tax benefit from stock option exercises and million related to proceeds from a secured borrowing arrangement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a secured borrowing arrangement  under which we pledged a note receivable from a customer to serve as collateral for the obligation under a borrowing 
the arrangement includes recourse to certain other assets of the company in the event of customer default on the note receivable 
no significant guarantees beyond the recourse provisions exist 
this secured borrowing arrangement does not qualify as a sale of assets under fas no 
fas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  as we have continued involvement related to the recourse provisions 
as of march   we had  of the secured borrowing recorded under accrued liabilities and million recorded under other long term liabilities with a carrying value approximating the balance of the secured borrowing 
we had no secured borrowing arrangements as of march  at march   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit  principally related to contract performance  leaving borrowing availability under our line of credit of million 
at march   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
on january   we entered into a three year  million revolving credit facility the facility 
borrowings under the facility are permitted up to a maximum amount of million  including up to million of letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility bear interest  at our option  at either the lender s prime rate or at libor london interbank offered rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based on the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
the facility is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property assets 
the facility contains financial covenants that set a minimum ebitda limit for the twelve month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter at million  a minimum tangible net worth as of the last day of any fiscal quarter at million and a minimum quick ratio sum of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and marketable securities  divided by current liabilities as of the last day of any fiscal quarter at to 
we were in compliance with our loan covenants at march  
table of contents included in fiscal year operating cash flow is million we received as a result of a settlement with xetron 
operating income for fiscal year includes a benefit to cost of revenues of million related to this settlement 
in april  we filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the sec for the future sale of up to an additional million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants 
additionally  we had available million of these securities  which were previously registered under shelf registration statements we filed in june and september up to an aggregate of million of the securities may now be offered from time to time  separately or together  directly by us or through underwriters at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the expansion of our research and development and marketing efforts and the nature and timing of orders 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies which may require the use of cash 
we believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance our liquidity position 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our obligations under operating leases  irrevocable letters of credit  purchase commitments and other long term liabilities for the periods indicated for the fiscal years ending total after in thousands operating leases standby letters of credit secured borrowing purchase commitments total we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors  contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
these agreements help us secure pricing and product availability 
in addition  as previously discussed  we have entered into a secured borrowing arrangement under which the company pledged a note receivable from a customer to serve as collateral for the obligation under borrowing with recourse to other assets of the company in the event of customer default 
no significant guarantees beyond the recourse provision exist

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable  and short term obligations including the revolving line of credit 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
as of march   there was no foreign currency exchange contract outstanding 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the foreign currency risk for amounts payable to vendors in euros
