this discussion includes forward looking statements about the demand for our products and future results 
please refer to the note regarding forward looking statements section of this form k 
overview sales of the company s geophysical products are generally related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity  which is dependent  primarily  on oil and gas prices 
after an industry wide slowdown in marine seismic activity in fiscal  marine seismic exploration activity started to improve during fiscal  and this improvement has continued through fiscal the high price of oil  increased worldwide energy demand and the depletion of proven oil and natural gas reserves have contributed to an increased demand for marine seismic surveys 
as a result  demand for the company s geophysical equipment remains strong 
the company s geophysical equipment sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as customer orders for complete energy source systems  replacement parts for energy source systems  ssms and underwater electrical connectors and cables increased substantially 
the company believes that the oil services industry will continue to experience growth in fiscal due to the continued imbalance between supply and demand for hydrocarbons  low reserve replacement rates and high commodity prices 
in addition  we anticipate increased use of more sophisticated technology  such as d and wide azimuth surveys  to more effectively manage proven reservoirs 
these surveys create a need for a larger seismic vessel fleet because such surveys require significantly more vessel time than traditional d or exploration surveys 
sales in the industrial products segment increased by for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the company anticipates that industrial products sales should continue to increase in fiscal due to the addition of new customers and pricing 
due primarily to the increase in the geophysical equipment business as described above  the company s balance sheet continued to strengthen during fiscal working capital at june  was million  an increase of over june  liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company believes that current cash and cash equivalent balances and projected cash flow from operations are adequate to meet foreseeable operating needs in fiscal as well as the cash required for the real time systems acquisition 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the real time systems acquisition 
in may  the company entered into a  unsecured revolving credit agreement with a bank to provide funds for general corporate purposes should the need arise 
during fiscal  the company has not borrowed against this facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the revolving credit agreement 
year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount is  or higher than the amount of cash and cash equivalents at june  for fiscal  cash flow from operating activities after changes in working capital items was  primarily due to net income adjusted for depreciation and deferred income taxes and higher current liabilities partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories 
for fiscal  the company used  for capital expenditures funded from operating cash flow which relate to new and replacement equipment and a small expansion of the cypress  texas manufacturing facility 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for fiscal will approximate  which will be funded from operating cash flow 
these anticipated capital expenditures will relate primarily to new and replacement production machinery 
since a relatively small number of customers account for the majority of the company s geophysical segment sales  the consolidated accounts receivable balance at the end of any period tends to be concentrated in a small number of customers 
at june  and june   the five customers with the highest accounts receivable balances represented  in the aggregate  and  respectively  of the consolidated accounts receivable balances on those dates 
in october  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the company was authorized to buy up to  shares of its common stock in open market or private transactions 
although the program remains authorized  the company has not repurchased any shares and currently has no plan to make repurchases 
year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount is  or higher than the amount of cash and cash equivalents at june  for fiscal  cash flow from operating activities after changes in working capital items was  primarily due to net income adjusted for depreciation and deferred income taxes and higher current liabilities partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories 
for fiscal  the company used  for capital expenditures funded from operating cash flow for new and replacement equipment 
of this amount  approximately  related to the purchase of two new manufacturing machines for the geophysical equipment segment 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the company had no long term borrowings  capital leases  purchase obligations or other long term liabilities at june  and the company has an unsecured revolving credit facility with a bank see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this facility 
during fiscal  there were no borrowings under this facility 
the company is obligated for minimum lease payments as of june  under several operating leases for its facilities as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations such amounts are exclusive of any additional rent for taxes  utilities or similar charges  under triple net leases 
see note to consolidated financial statements under lease commitments for further information regarding future payments and other information relating to such leases 
see note to consolidated financial statements under subsequent event for information regarding the asset purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of the net assets of real time systems 
results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  consolidated sales for the year ended june  totaled  an increase of  or from the fiscal year ended june  sales of geophysical equipment increased by  or from the fiscal year ended june   due to higher volume of sales of complete energy source systems  air gun replacement parts  and underwater electrical connectors and cables and ssms 
higher sales in the geophysical equipment business reflect the continuing strength in marine seismic activity 
industrial products sales for the year ended june  increased by  or compared to the year ended june  the increase principally reflects higher slip clutch sales 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales gross margin was for the year ended june  versus for the year ended june  gross margin for the geophysical equipment segment was for the year ended june  versus for the year ended june  the geophysical equipment segment gross margin improvement was due to higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the increase in sales of geophysical equipment and higher pricing  partially offset by higher material and labor costs 
in addition  the gross margin for the year ended june  was adversely affected by sales of auxiliary equipment purchased from third party suppliers 
third party auxiliary equipment has significantly lower gross profit margins than the company s proprietary products 
gross margin for the industrial products segment increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   primarily due to higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase 
research and development costs for the year ended june  decreased by  or from the year ended june  these expenditures are associated with work being done to improve the company s apg guns and ssms 
the decrease is due primarily to lower spending for improvements to ssms 
ssms is utilized to measure air gun depth  air pressure  and near field energy output for each gun array and to provide high pressure air flow control  thereby enhancing the accuracy and therefore the usefulness of marine seismic survey data 
the company continues to work on more advanced stages of ssms which will deliver further benefits to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended june  from the year ended june  due primarily to higher compensation expense  professional fees  and freight out 
the increase in compensation expense primarily reflects higher incentive compensation  salaries for staff additions and salary increases  higher professional fees are primarily due to incremental expenses incurred to become compliant with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and higher freight out is attributable to the sales increase 
the company conducted an annual impairment test of goodwill balances as of july  and the results of these tests indicated that there was no impairment of the june  and goodwill balances 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of 
this rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to tax benefits for export sales and the manufacturer s deduction  partially offset by state income taxes and income taxes attributable to goodwill amortization for tax purposes 
the provision for income taxes for year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of 
this rate was higher than the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to state income taxes and income taxes attributable to goodwill amortization for tax purposes  partially offset by the tax benefit for export sales and the manufacturer s deduction 
the above mentioned factors resulted in net income for the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  year ended june  compared to year ended june  consolidated sales for the year ended june  totaled  an increase of  or from the fiscal year ended june  sales of geophysical equipment increased by  or  due to higher volume of sales of complete energy source systems  air gun replacement parts  and underwater electrical connectors and cables and ssms 
higher sales in the geophysical equipment business reflect the continuing strength in marine seismic activity 
industrial products sales for the year ended june  decreased by  or compared to the year ended june  the fiscal sales decrease reflects lower electric motor sales 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales gross margin was for the year ended june   unchanged from the year ended june  gross margin for the geophysical equipment segment was for the year ended june  unchanged from the year ended june  the gross margin for geophysical equipment for the year ended june  was adversely affected by i higher raw material costs  ii higher labor costs  and iii certain sales which included several items of auxiliary equipment purchased from third party suppliers which typically have a lower gross margin than the company s proprietary products 
effective february   the company implemented a price increase for air guns and related replacement parts in response to higher material and labor costs 
effective june   the company implemented a price increase for underwater electrical connectors and cables in response to higher material and labor costs 
the adverse effect on the gross margin for geophysical equipment was offset by these price increases  resulting in an unchanged gross margin 
gross margin for the industrial products segment decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   reflecting higher compensation cost partially offset by lower retirement plan cost 
the company implemented a price increase for industrial products effective april  research and development costs for the year ended june  increased by  or from the year ended june  due to work being done to improve apg guns and ssms 
the company continues working on more advanced stages of ssms that will deliver further benefits to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended june  from the year ended june  primarily due to higher compensation expense 
the increase in compensation expense related primarily to higher incentive compensation

the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was  an effective tax rate of which was the same rate as the federal statutory rate  primarily due to the effect of state income taxes  nondeductible expenses and income taxes attributable to goodwill amortization for tax purposes fully offset by the tax benefit of export sales 
the above mentioned factors resulted in net income for the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying the accounting policies most critical to its financial statements have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include revenue recognition  recording of inventory reserves  deferred taxes  and the potential impairment of goodwill 
these policies are discussed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies  including the establishment of bad debt reserves 
the company believes that these other policies either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or that it is less likely that they would have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
although the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  these are based on information available at the end of each reporting period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and its estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales revenue when it is realized and earned 
the company s reported sales revenue is based on meeting the following criteria manufacturing products based on customer specifications  delivering product to the customer before the close of the reporting period  whereby delivery results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer  establishing a set sales price with the customer  collecting the sales revenue from the customer is reasonably assured  and no contingencies exist 
inventory reserves a significant source of the company s revenue arises from the sale of replacement parts required by customers who have previously purchased products 
as a result  the company maintains a large quantity of parts on hand that may not be sold or used in final assemblies for an extended period of time 
in order to recognize that certain inventory may become obsolete or have supplies in excess of reasonably supportable sales forecasts  an inventory valuation reserve has been established 
the inventory valuation reserve is a significant estimate made by management 
actual results may differ from this estimate  and the difference could be material 
management establishes the inventory valuation reserve by reviewing the inventory for items that should be reserved in full based on a lack of usage for a specified period of time and for which future demand is not forecasted and establishes an additional reserve for slow moving inventory based on varying percentages of the cost of the items 
the reserve for inventory valuation at june  and was  and  respectively 
at june  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the raw materials and sub assemblies inventory were considered slow moving and subject to a reserve provision equal to all or a portion of the cost  less an estimate for scrap value 
in certain instances  this inventory has been unsold for more than five years from date of manufacture or purchase  and in other instances the company has more than a five year supply of inventory on hand based on recent sales volume 
at june   the cost of inventory which has more than a five year supply on hand and the cost of inventory which has had no sales during the last five years amounted to approximately  management believes that this inventory is properly valued and appropriately reserved 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  it would not result in a cash outlay since the cash required to manufacture or purchase the older inventory was expended in prior years 
the inventory valuation reserve is adjusted at the close of each accounting period  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the valuation reserve required 
this estimate is calculated on a consistent basis as determined by the company s inventory valuation policy 
increases to the inventory valuation reserve result in a charge to cost of sales  and decreases to the reserve result in a credit to cost of sales 
the inventory valuation reserve is also decreased when items are scrapped or disposed of 
during the fiscal year ended june   the inventory valuation reserve was increased by  and the company did not scrap or dispose of any items 
deferred taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
the company reviews its internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make its assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment changes  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has concluded that no deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at june  and june  because future taxable income is believed to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset 
goodwill impairment testing as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
goodwill was tested for impairment as of july  and and the tests indicated no impairment 
the tests were conducted by management 
the company s goodwill carrying amounts relate solely to the acquisition of custom products and a g  which are two sfas no 
reporting units 
bolt  the parent of custom products and a g  is a third reporting unit and has no goodwill 
both bolt and a g are in the geophysical equipment segment  and custom products is in the industrial products segment 
goodwill represents approximately of the company s total assets at june  and is thus a significant estimate by management 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  it would not result in a cash outlay because the company s goodwill amounts reflected on its balance sheet arose out of acquisition accounting several years ago

recent accounting developments the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the company s first fiscal year that begins after november  the company believes that sfas will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements in september  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab

sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  application of the guidance in sab did not have an effect on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  which is an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in the balance sheet 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  sfas did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because the company does not have any defined benefit or other postretirement plans 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require new fair value measurements 
the purpose of sfas is to provide a single definition of fair value and to provide additional guidance relative to fair value measurements 
the end result of sfas application will be consistency and comparability in fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company believes that it is unlikely that sfas will have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because the company does not deal in transactions requiring complex fair value measurements
