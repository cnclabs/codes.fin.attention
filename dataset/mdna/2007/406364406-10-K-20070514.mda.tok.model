risk factors risks related to the company influence of significant stockholder 
the company s chairman and chief executive officer  mr 
anthony j 
gumbiner  owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis as of march  accordingly  mr 
gumbiner can exert substantial influence over the affairs of the company 
the company is dependent on its key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
the company is dependent upon its executive officers for strategic business direction and specialized industry experience 
while the company believes that it could find replacements for these key personnel  loss of their services could adversely affect the company s operations 
risks related to our textile products business the company s textile products business may be affected by the following risk factors  each of which could adversely affect the company 
suppliers 
brookwood purchases a significant amount of the fabric and other materials it processes and sells from a small number of suppliers 
brookwood believes that the loss of any one of its suppliers would not have a long term material adverse effect because other manufacturers with which brookwood conducts business would be able to fulfill those requirements 
however  the loss of certain of brookwood s suppliers could  in the short term  adversely affect brookwood s business until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any new supply arrangements would have terms as favorable as those contained in current supply arrangements 
brookwood has not experienced any significant disruptions in supply as a result of shortages in fabrics or other materials from its suppliers 
sales concentration 
sales to one brookwood customer  tennier industries  inc tennier  accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in each of the three years ended december  its relationship with tennier is ongoing 
sales to tennier  which are included in military sales  were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
sales to another customer  orc industries  inc orc  have increased in and accounted for more than of brookwood s sales 
its relationship with orc is ongoing 
sales to orc  which are also included in 
table of contents military sales  were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
through  military sales  including the sales to tennier and orc  generally comprised an increased portion of brookwood s total sales and a greater share of gross profit 
however  brookwood experienced reduced military sales in military sales were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been more volatile and difficult to predict  a trend the company believes is likely to continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the increased activity of the us military 
if this activity does not continue or declines  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
the military has recently limited orders for existing products and adopted revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
while any change in specifications or orders presents a potential opportunity for additional sales  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications and production requirements 
brookwood is currently conducting research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participating in the bidding process for new military products 
the us government has recently released orders for goods that include brookwood s products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
therefore  the company is unable at this time to predict future sale trends 
concentration of credit 
the financial instruments that potentially subject brookwood to concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable 
brookwood grants credit to customers based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer s financial condition 
brookwood manages its exposure to credit risks through credit approvals  credit limits  monitoring procedures and the use of factors 
the amount of receivables that brookwood can factor is subject to certain limitations as specified in individual factoring agreements 
the factoring agreements expose brookwood to credit risk if any of the factors fail to meet their obligations 
brookwood seeks to manage this risk by conducting business with a number of reputable factors and monitoring the factors performance under their agreements 
loan covenants 
brookwood s revolving credit agreement requires compliance with various loan covenants and financial ratios  principally a total debt to tangible net worth ratio of and a requirement that net income must exceed one dollar 
brookwood was in compliance with its loan covenants as of december  and for all interim periods during environmental 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are subject to a broad range of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the pollution and protection of the environment 
among the many environmental requirements applicable to kenyon and brookwood laminating are laws relating to air emissions  ozone depletion  wastewater discharges and the handling  disposal and release of solid and hazardous substances and wastes 
based on continuing internal review and advice from independent consultants  kenyon and brookwood laminating believe that they are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are also subject to such laws as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on site or off site locations 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are not aware of any releases for which they may be liable under cercla or any analogous provision 
actions by federal  state and local governments concerning environmental matters could result in laws or regulations that could increase the cost of producing the products manufactured by kenyon and brookwood laminating or otherwise adversely affect demand for their products 
widespread adoption of any prohibitions or restrictions could adversely affect the cost and or the ability to produce products and thereby have a material adverse effect upon kenyon  brookwood laminating or brookwood 

table of contents brookwood does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental requirements 
some risk of environmental liability is inherent  however  in the nature of brookwood s business 
there can be no assurance that material environmental liabilities will not arise 
it is also possible that future developments in environmental regulation could lead to material environmental compliance or cleanup costs 
patent and trademark 
brookwood considers its patents and trademarks  in the aggregate  to be important to its business and seeks to protect this proprietary know how in part through us patent and trademark registrations 
no assurance can be given  however  that such protection will give brookwood any material competitive advantage 
in addition  brookwood maintains certain trade secrets for which  in order to maintain the confidentiality of such trade secrets  it has not sought patent or trademark protection 
as a result  such trade secrets could be infringed upon and such infringement could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position 
competition 
the cyclical nature of the textile and apparel industries  characterized by rapid shifts in fashion  consumer demand and competitive pressures  results in both price and demand volatility 
the demand for any particular product varies from time to time based largely upon changes in consumer  military or industrial preferences and general economic conditions affecting the textile and apparel industries  such as consumer expenditures for non durable goods 
the textile and apparel industries are also cyclical because the supply of particular products changes as competitors enter or leave the market 
brookwood sells primarily to domestic manufacturers  some of which operate offshore sewing operations 
some of brookwood s customers have moved their business offshore during the past few years 
brookwood has responded by shipping fabric asia to asia and also by supplying finished products and garments directly to manufacturers 
brookwood competes with numerous domestic and foreign fabric manufacturers  including companies larger in size and having greater financial resources than brookwood 
the principal competitive factors in the woven fabrics markets are price  service  delivery time  quality and flexibility  with the relative importance of each factor depending upon the needs of particular customers and the specific product offering 
brookwood s management believes that brookwood maintains its ability to compete effectively by providing its customers with a broad array of high quality fabrics at competitive prices on a timely basis 
brookwood s competitive position varies by product line 
there are several major domestic competitors in the synthetic fabrics business  none of which dominates the market 
brookwood believes  however  that it has a strong competitive position 
in addition  brookwood believes it is one of a few finishers successful in printing camouflage on nylon for sale to apparel suppliers of the us government 
additional competitive strengths of brookwood include knowledge of its customers business needs  its ability to produce special fabrics such as textured blends  waterproof breathable fabrics  state of the art fabric finishing equipment at its facilities  substantial vertical integration  and its ability to communicate electronically with its customers 
imports and worldwide trade practices 
imports of foreign made textile and apparel products are a significant source of competition for most sectors of the domestic textile industry 
the us government has attempted to regulate the growth of certain textile and apparel imports through tariffs and bilateral agreements  which establish quotas on imports from lesser developed countries that historically account for significant shares of us imports 
despite these efforts  imported apparel  which represents the area of heaviest import penetration  is estimated to represent in excess of of the us market 
the us textile industry has been and continues to be negatively impacted by existing worldwide trade practices  including the north american free trade agreement nafta  anti dumping and duty enforcement activities by the us government and by the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies 
the establishment of the world trade organization wto in has resulted in the phase out of quotas on textiles and apparel  effective january  notwithstanding quota elimination  china s accession agreement for membership in the wto provides that wto member countries including the united states  canada and european countries may re impose quotas on specific categories of products in the event it is determined that imports from china have surged and are threatening to create a market disruption for such categories of products 
during  the united states and china agreed to a new quota arrangement  which will impose quotas on certain textile products through the end of in addition  the european union also agreed with china on a new textile 
table of contents arrangement  which imposed quotas through the end of the united states may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported from china or other countries in such increased quantities as to cause or threaten serious damage to the relevant domestic industry generally known as anti dumping actions 
in addition  china has imposed an export tax on all textile products manufactured in china  we do not believe this tax will have a material impact on our business 
in  the us government unveiled a proposal to eliminate worldwide tariffs for manufactured goods by the european union has also proposed significant reductions in tariffs 
these proposals have been discussed during the ongoing wto doha round of multilateral negotiations  and could lead to further significant changes in worldwide tariffs beyond those already anticipated 
accordingly  brookwood believes it must fully utilize other competitive strategies to replace sales lost to importers 
one strategy is to identify new market niches 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has been developing advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer application is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing enterprise value of brookwood is contingent on its ability to maintain its level of military business and adapt to the global textile industry  however  there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained or that competitors will not aggressively seek to replace products developed by brookwood 
the us government engaged in discussions with a number of countries or trading blocs with the intent of further liberalizing trade 
authority to negotiate new fast track agreements has been granted by congress  making new agreements in this field more likely 
the us government has also entered into a free trade agreement with australia  bahrain  chile  israel  jordan  morocco and singapore 
labor relations 
kenyon has entered into a three year collective bargaining agreement with the union of needletrades  industrial and textile employees  at its rhode island facility  effective from march  management believes that overall relations with employees are good 
brookwood is dependent on its key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
brookwood is dependent upon its executive officers for strategic business direction and specialized industry experience 
while the company believes that it could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could adversely affect brookwood s operations 
risks related to our energy business the company s energy investment may be affected by the following risk factors  each of which could adversely affect the value of the investments 
volatility of natural gas prices 
a decline in natural gas prices could adversely affect financial results 
revenues  operating results  profitability  future rate of growth and the value of the natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices received for natural gas sold 
historically  the markets for natural gas have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
wide fluctuations in natural gas prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas  market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond the company s control  including worldwide and domestic supplies of natural gas  weather conditions  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and the overall economic environment 
declines in natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue  but could reduce the amount of natural gas that can be produced economically and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations and reserves for our hallwood energy affiliate 
drilling activities 
hallwood energy s success is materially dependent upon the continued success of its drilling program 
future drilling activities may not be successful and  if drilling activities are unsuccessful  such failure will have an adverse effect on hallwood energy s future results of operations and financial condition 
oil and gas drilling involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered  even if the reserves targeted are classified as proved 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment 
table of contents failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
although numerous drilling prospects have been identified  there can be no assurance that such prospects will be drilled or that oil or natural gas will be produced from any such identified prospects or any other prospects 
regulations 
the oil and gas industry is subject to regulation at the federal  state and local level  and some of the laws  rules and regulations carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances covering drilling and well operations 
operations are also subject to various conservation regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units and the unitization or pooling of oil or natural gas properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production 
environmental regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment  the disposal of contaminants and the protection of public health  natural resources and wildlife affect exploration  development and production operations 
under state and federal laws  hallwood energy could be required to remove or remedy previously disposed wastes or suspend operations in contaminated areas or perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
competition 
hallwood energy operates in a highly competitive area of acquisition  development and exploration of natural gas properties and production with competitors who have greater financial and other resources 
competitors from both major and independent oil and natural gas companies may be able to pay more for development prospects than the financial resources or human resources of hallwood energy permit 
hallwood energy s ability to develop and exploit natural gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on its ability to successfully conduct operations  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
quantity and present value of reserves 
financial information for hallwood energy may contain or be based on estimates of proved reserves and the estimated future net revenues for the proved reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions relating to gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating natural gas reserves is complex and these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual results will most likely vary from these estimates 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of an estimate 
environmental 
natural gas operations are subject to many environmental hazards and risks  including well blowouts  cratering and explosions  pipe failures  fires  formations with abnormal pressure  uncontrollable flows of natural gas  brine or well fluids  and other hazards and risks 
drilling operations involve risks from high pressures and mechanical difficulties such as stock pipes  collapsed casings and separated cables 
if any of these risks occur  substantial losses could result from injury or loss of life  severe damages to or destruction of property  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations 
insurance is maintained against some of these risks  but may not adequately cover all of a catastrophic loss 
loan covenants 
in april  hallwood energy entered into a  senior secured credit facility with an affiliate of one of the investors 
the facility contains various financial covenants  including maximum general and administrative expenditures and current and proved collateral coverage ratios 
the initial proved collateral coverage ratio test is performed june   and each quarter thereafter 
non financial covenants restrict the ability of hallwood energy to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments  pay dividends  create liens on assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations or engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and otherwise restrict certain activities by hallwood energy 
the new lender may demand that hallwood energy prepay the outstanding loans in the event of a defined change of control  qualified sale or event of default  including a material adverse event 

table of contents the facility contains a make whole provision whereby hallwood energy is required to pay the lender the amount by which the present value of interest and principal payable from the date of prepayment through january   exceeds the principal amount at the prepayment date

environmental contingencies 
a number of jurisdictions in which the company operates have adopted laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
such laws and regulations may require the company to secure governmental permits and approvals and undertake measures to comply therewith 
compliance with the requirements imposed may be time consuming and costly 
while environmental considerations  by themselves  have not significantly affected the company s business to date  it is possible that such considerations may have a significant and adverse impact in the future 
the company actively monitors its environmental compliance and while certain matters currently exist  management is not aware of any compliance issues which will significantly impact the financial position  operations or cash flows of the company 
in august  the rhode island department of health ridoh issued a compliance order to kenyon  alleging that kenyon is a non community water system and ordering kenyon to comply with the ridoh program for public water supply systems 
kenyon contested the compliance order and an administrative hearing was held in november no decision has been rendered

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
until july  the company was a diversified holding company with interests in textiles  real estate and energy 
since that time  the company disposed of its interests in hrp in july  which constituted substantially all of its real estate activities  and hec and he iii  two of its energy affiliates  in december and july  respectively 
the company received total cash proceeds from these transactions of approximately  these proceeds were used to repay bank debt  the company s debentures and other obligations and make additional investments in its energy affiliates 
in addition  the company paid cash dividends to its common stockholders of approximately  or per share  on may   and approximately  or per share  on august  the company had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents at december  although the company s textile activities have generated positive cash flow in recent years  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
in addition  hallwood energy will require significant additional capital investment over the next few years to acquire additional properties and to adequately explore and develop existing and any new properties 
textile products 
the company derives substantially all of its operating revenues from the textile products activities of its brookwood subsidiary  consequently  the company s success is highly dependent upon brookwood s success 
brookwood s success will be influenced in varying degrees by its ability to continue sales to existing customers  cost and availability of supplies  brookwood s response to competition  its ability to generate new markets and products and the effect of global trade regulations 
while brookwood has enjoyed substantial growth in its military business  there is no assurance this trend will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been more volatile and difficult to predict  a trend the company believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the increased activity of the us military 
if this activity does not continue or declines  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
military sales of   and  for  and  respectively  were lower in and lower in from the prior years 
the military has recently limited orders for existing products and adopted revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
while any change in specifications or orders presents a potential opportunity for additional sales  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications and production requirements 
brookwood is currently conducting research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participating in the bidding process for new military products 
the us government has recently released orders for goods that include brookwood s products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
therefore  the company is unable at this time to predict future sale trends 
unstable global nylon and chemical pricing  coupled with higher domestic energy costs  are causing overall cost increases  which  together with product mix  have negatively impacted brookwood s margins  a trend that appears likely to continue 
brookwood continues to identify new market niches to replace sales lost to importers 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has been developing advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer applications is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing enterprise value of brookwood is contingent on its ability to maintain its level of military business and adapt to the global textile industry  however  there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained or that competitors will not aggressively seek to replace products developed by brookwood 

table of contents the textile industry is also significantly affected by legislation and administrative actions restricting or liberalizing trade among world textile producing and consuming countries such as the nafta  the wto  the anti dumping and countervailing duty remedies and enforcement activities by the us government  and the value of the united states dollar in relation to other currencies and world economic developments 
however  under nafta there are no textile and apparel quotas between the us and either mexico or canada for products that meet certain origin criteria 
tariffs among the three countries are either already zero or are being phased out 
also  the wto recently phased out textile and apparel quotas 
the us has also approved the central american free trade agreement cafta with five central american countries costa rica  el salvador  guatemala  honduras and nicaragua 
under cafta  textile and apparel originating from cafta countries will be duty and quota free  provided that yarn formed in the united states or other cafta countries is used to produce the fabric 
in addition  the united states recently implemented bilateral free trade agreements with australia  bahrain  chile  israel  jordan  morocco and singapore 
although these actions have the effect of exposing brookwood s market to the lower price structures of the other countries and  therefore  continuing to increase competitive pressures  management is not able to predict their specific impact 
the textile products business is not interdependent with the company s other business operations 
the company does not guarantee the brookwood bank facility and is not obligated to contribute additional capital

following the sale of he iii in july  the company s remaining affiliates were he ii  he and hallwood exploration 
at that time  the company owned between and of the entities between and on a fully diluted basis and accounted for the investments using the equity method of accounting  recording its pro rata share of net income loss  partners capital transactions and comprehensive income loss 
these private companies were principally involved in acquiring oil and gas leases and drilling  gathering and sale of natural gas in the barnett shale formation of parker  hood and tarrant counties in north texas  the barnett shale and woodford shale formations in west texas  the fayetteville shale formation in central eastern arkansas  and conducting d seismic surveys over optioned land covering a salt dome in south louisiana in order to determine how best to proceed with exploratory activity 
effective december   the remaining private energy affiliates were consolidated into he  which was renamed hallwood energy 
all energy activities are now conducted by hallwood energy 
the company owns approximately after consideration of profits interests of hallwood energy at december  refer also to the section investments in energy affiliates for a further description of the company s energy activities 
discontinued operations 
the company s real estate activities were conducted primarily through certain wholly owned subsidiaries 
one of the subsidiaries served as the general partner of hrp  and another served as property manager 
revenues were generated from the receipt of management fees  leasing commissions and other fees from hrp and third parties and the company s pro rata share of earnings of hrp using the equity method of accounting 
in july  hrp was merged with a subsidiary of hrpt 
as a result  hrp became a wholly owned subsidiary of hrpt and was no longer a publicly traded limited partnership 
the general partner interest in hrp was also sold to a hrpt subsidiary in a separate transaction and the management agreements for the properties were terminated 
the company no longer holds any interest in hrp

in december  the company decided to dispose of its hotel segment  which at that time consisted of five hotel properties 
accordingly  the company s hotel operations were reclassified as a discontinued operation 
two hotels were disposed of in and two hotels were disposed of in the company continued to operate a leasehold interest in one hotel until december  when the hotel subsidiary entered into a lease termination and mutual release agreement 
as of december   the company had no further operations associated with the hotel segment 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition 
textile products sales are recognized upon shipment or release of product  when title passes to the customer 
brookwood provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of brookwood s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
on occasion  brookwood receives instructions from some of its customers to finish fabric  invoice the full amount and hold the finished inventory until the customer sends shipping instructions 
in those cases  brookwood records the sale and sends the customer an invoice containing normal and usual payment terms and identifies the inventory as separate from brookwood s inventory 
generally  a customer provides such instructions to accommodate its lack of available storage space for inventory 
this practice is customary in the textile industry and with respect to certain brookwood customers 
in these cases  the brookwood customer either dictates delivery dates at the time the order is placed or when the customer has not specified a fixed delivery date  the customer owns the goods and has asked brookwood to keep them in the warehouse until the customer provides a delivery date 
for all of its bill and hold sales  brookwood has no future obligations  the customer is billed when the product is ready for shipment and expected to pay under standard billing and credit terms  regardless of the actual delivery date  and the inventory is identified and not available for brookwood s use 
brookwood s total bill and hold sales in and were less than one percent of sales 
the bill and hold inventory held for customers at december  and  were approximately  and  respectively 
deferred income tax asset 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized for net operating loss and certain other tax carryforwards  tax credits and temporary differences  reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized 
management is required to estimate taxable income for future years and to use its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance to reduce part or all of a deferred tax asset 
management considered various tax planning strategies  anticipated gains from the potential sale of investments and projected income from operations to determine the valuation allowance to be recorded 
as a result of the significant taxable income reported in and projected taxable income  management eliminated its valuation allowance during impairment of long lived assets 
management routinely reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in the event such indicators exist for assets held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
significant assumptions used in this process depend upon the nature of the investment  but would include an evaluation of the future business opportunities  sources of competition  advancement of technology and its impact on patents and processes and the level of expected operating expenses 

table of contents impairment of investments accounted for under equity method 
investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment is believed to have fallen below the company s carrying value 
when such a decline is deemed other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to the statement of operations for the difference between the investment s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time 
in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary  the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline  the investee s financial performance  and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s market value 
however  a decline in the quoted market price below the carrying amount or the existence of operating losses is not necessarily indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary 
all are factors to be evaluated 
differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired 
from time to time  the company performs impairment reviews and determines if a writedown is required 
the company s evaluation of its investment in hallwood energy contains assumptions including i an evaluation of reserves using assumptions commonly used in the industry  some of which are not the same as are required by the sec to be used for financial reporting purposes  ii realization of fair value for various reserve categories based upon hallwood energy s historical experience  and iii value per acre in a potential sale transaction  based upon acreage owned in productive areas with shale characteristics similar to acreage previously sold by hec and he iii and other recent sale activity of acreage with shale formations 
inventories 
inventories at the brookwood subsidiary are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted for changes in market value based on assumptions related to past and future demand and worldwide and local market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions vary from those projected by management  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported 
presentation the company intends the discussion of its financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding its financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect its financial statements
