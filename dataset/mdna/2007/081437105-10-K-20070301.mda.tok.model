three year review of results dollars in millions net sales cost of products sold gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses all other expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income effective income tax rate overview bemis company  inc is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets 
generally about percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry 
sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices  personal care  and lawn and garden 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry provides a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment  which accounts for about percent of our net sales 
the remaining percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets 
market conditions the markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive 
our leading flexible packaging market positions in north and south america reflect our focus on value added  proprietary products that are not available from most of our competitors 
during  many of our large customers announced sales growth strategies that were supported by new product introductions 
this provides opportunities for future growth at bemis since new customer products often require innovative new packaging 
in europe and asia  where our market position is smaller  we continue to introduce our proprietary products to the market  and we are encouraged by the strengthening economies in those regions 
the stronger european economy has also benefited our pressure sensitive graphic product line which is predominately sold in europe 
the primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins and adhesives 
the cost of raw materials moderated during after experiencing a period of significant volatility during late and raw material costs have been impacted in recent years by higher energy prices in addition to production disruptions related to the gulf coast hurricanes 
restructuring and related charges on january   we announced a facility consolidation project intended to reduce fixed costs and shift production to lower cost facilities 
these cost reduction efforts included the closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility during and was substantially complete as of december  restructuring and related charges incurred in totaled million  of which million primarily reflected accelerated depreciation and was recorded as a component of cost of products sold 
the remaining million primarily reflects employee related costs and was recorded as a component of other costs income 
during  we initiated a restructuring program in which five facilities were closed 
while most of the restructuring activities were completed as of december   gains and losses related to the sale of these closed facilities resulted in a net charge of million in and a net gain of million in acquisitions on january   we acquired majority ownership of dixie toga sa  one of the largest packaging companies in south america with annual revenues totaling about million 
the acquisition included the outstanding voting common stock of dixie toga in addition to percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock 
the initial cash purchase price  paid in  was approximately million increased by million in related to post close adjustments 
this acquisition significantly increased our exposure to the growing south american packaging market and provides a strong platform from which to introduce our propriety film products to a new region 
subsequently  our south american subsidiary has repurchased additional shares of its outstanding preferred stock in the open market  reducing the total minority interest in our subsidiary to percent as of december  in april  we also acquired the remaining shares of our three majority owned joint ventures in mexico for million 
results of operations consolidated overview in millions  except per share amounts net sales net income diluted earnings per share versus for the year ended december   net sales increased percent 
currency translation was a benefit to net sales growth of percent 
the remaining percent increase in net sales reflects increased sales of higher priced  value added products in each of the two business segments 
diluted earnings per share were for  including per share of restructuring and related charges 
for  diluted earnings per share totaled  including approximately per share of tax charges related to the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under the american jobs creation act of the improvement in resulted from a more profitable sales mix  a moderating raw material cost environment  and successful cost management efforts 
versus for the year ended december   net sales increased percent 
the dixie toga acquisition accounted for percent of the increase in sales while currency translation was insignificant to net sales growth in the remaining percent increase in net sales reflects the impact of increased price and mix in all market categories 
price increases during were driven by increased raw material costs 
unit volume was flat compared to diluted earnings per share were for  including per share of tax charges related to the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under the american jobs creation act of for  diluted earnings per share totaled  including a net gain of per share on the sale of certain plant assets 
results for were negatively impacted by significant increases in raw material costs during the year 
flexible packaging business segment our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets  including meat and cheese  confectionery and snack  frozen foods  lawn and garden  health and hygiene  beverages  medical devices  bakery  and dry foods 
these markets are generally less affected by economic cycles and grow through product innovation and geographical expansion 
the most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins  which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products 
during periods of unusual raw material cost volatility  selling price changes may lag behind changes in our raw material costs 
during both and  resin costs dramatically increased resulting in double digit percentage increases for each year 
these raw material costs were reflected in increased selling prices throughout each year  however the magnitude and frequency of the cost increases negatively impacted operating profit 
the impact of raw material cost changes in was more moderate 
in january of  we announced a restructuring plan to close five flexible packaging plants in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency throughout this business segment 
these efforts were substantially completed by december  restructuring and related charges for the flexible packaging business segment totaled million in the disposal of facilities closed during the restructuring program resulted in a charge of million in and a gain of million in dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus our flexible packaging business segment recorded a percent increase in net sales in currency translation was a benefit of percent 
the remaining percent increase is attributable to increased net sales for packaging in markets such as meat and cheese  health and hygiene  coffee  unitizing films for cans and bottles  and medical devices 
this was partially offset by lower net sales for markets such as confectionery  snack and frozen foods 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent in from percent in during  restructuring and related charges totaling million were recorded as a reduction of operating profit 
operating profit in benefited from stronger sales of value added flexible packaging products 
during  operating profit includes the impact of restructuring and related charges totaling million 
versus our flexible packaging business segment recorded a percent increase in net sales in the acquisition of dixie toga increased sales by percent 
the remaining percent increase is attributable to price and mix across all market categories 
increases in demand for packaging in markets such as meat and cheese  health and hygiene  cereal and other dry foods  coffee  unitizing films for cans and bottles  and medical devices were offset by lower unit sales for markets such as confectionery and snack  frozen foods  bakery  and pet products 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in florence  kentucky 
during  raw material cost increases outpaced increases in selling prices  negatively impacting operating profit 
pressure sensitive materials business segment the pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets prime and variable information labels  which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets  graphic design  used to create signage and decorations  and technical components  which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics  automotive  construction and medical industries 
paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment 
for the last several years  general economic conditions have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs 
in january of  we announced a restructuring plan which included the closure of one pressure sensitive materials plant in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency 
this effort was completed by december  restructuring and related charges incurred and related to the pressure sensitive materials business segment totaled million in these costs were primarily employee related costs and were recorded as a component of other costs income  net 
in  we announced the restructuring of our label products capacity  closing two facilities to reduce fixed costs and improve capacity utilization 
during  restructuring and related charges totaling million related primarily to the cost of closing a label products plant in nevada 
of this total  million represented equipment relocation and was recorded as other costs income  net  with the remaining costs associated with accelerated depreciation charged to costs of products sold 
during  a net gain of million was recorded for the sale of previously closed facilities and property 
during  we changed the year end of our pressure sensitive materials european subsidiary from november to december this resulted in a month reporting period in for this subsidiary  increasing net sales by million 
the impact on operating profit was insignificant 
dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of percent in net sales in include the impact of the thirteenth month of net sales from the european subsidiary 
the increase in net sales in was driven by unit sales volume growth in each of the pressure sensitive materials product lines during the year 
currency benefits provided less than one percent net sales growth in operating profit as a percent of sales improved in compared to  reflecting increased sales of value added graphic and technical products 
in addition  the profitability of the label product line increased with continued improvements in cost management and production efficiency 
currency translation did not impact operating profit in versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of percent in the thirteenth month of net sales from the european subsidiary accounted for about percent sales growth compared to the remaining percent increase was driven by unit sales volume growth in label products during the year  partially offset by unit sales volume decreases in the other product categories 
price increases were offset by increased unit sales of lower priced label products in  and currency had no impact on net sales for the year 
improved profit levels in reflect improved profit from label products and focused cost control measures 
currency translation did not impact operating profit in and contributed million in consolidated gross margin dollars in millions gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by million in and million in the time lag between the implementation of selling price increases and increases in raw material costs reduced gross margins as a percent of net sales in each of the years presented 
this reduction in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by ongoing improvements in production efficiency  sales mix and cost management during the same timeframe 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales in  the lower ratio of expenses to net sales reflects the benefits of cost management programs  and the impact of higher selling prices on consolidated net sales 
in  the lower ratio compared to reflects lower costs associated with the south american operations purchased in january  and the impact of higher selling prices on consolidated net sales 
other expenses dollars in millions research and development r d r d as a percentage of net sales interest expense other costs income  net minority interest in net income income taxes effective tax rate research and development our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness and relevance of our research and developments activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold 
interest expense the increase in interest expense in reflects higher interest rates in compared to and in addition  debt levels increased in as a result of the january acquisition of dixie toga 
prior to  substantially all of our outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates 
in  we issued million of fixed rate public bonds at a percent interest rate 
this effectively reduced our percentage of variable rate debt to about percent in and percent in the effective interest rate was percent in  percent in  and percent in other costs income  net in  other costs income included million of restructuring and related charges  which were more than offset by financial income of million and a million favorable resolution of a litigated foreign excise tax liability 
about half of the financial income relates to interest income on cash held at non us locations 
the remainder of the financial income is generated from fiscal incentives for certain locations and is considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit 
in  net other expenses primarily reflect interest income offset by currency exchange losses 
net other income in includes a million gain on the sale of a rotogravure facility partially offset by restructuring and related charges of million 
equity income from our brazilian joint venture was million in since the january acquisition of dixie toga  the brazilian joint venture has been accounted for on a consolidated basis and the related operating results are included with the flexible packaging segment 
the remainder of other income in is primarily interest income 
minority interest in net income in connection with the january acquisition of dixie toga  we acquired approximately percent of the total outstanding shares of dixie toga 
as of december   our ownership had increased to approximately percent of the total outstanding shares 
the increase in minority interest in net income in is primarily due to the accounting for the shares of dixie toga that were not acquired 
in april  we acquired the remaining minority interest in our three mexican joint ventures which reduced minority interest in net income 
income taxes the difference between our overall tax rate and the u 
s 
statutory tax rate of percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits 
during  an additional million of tax expense was recorded as a result of the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  increasing the effective tax rate for from percent to percent 
for the total year  the effective tax rate was percent  reflecting the final determination of the benefits provided under the jobs act 
liquidity and capital resources debt to total capitalization debt to total capitalization which includes total debt  long term deferred tax liabilities and equity was percent at december   compared to percent at december  and percent at december  total debt was million  million  and million at year end  and  respectively 
the increase in primarily reflects the impact of the dixie toga acquisition in january credit rating our capital structure and financial practices have earned bemis company long term credit ratings of a from standard poor s and baa from moody s investors service  and a credit rating of a and prime for our commercial paper program from standard poor s and moody s investor service  respectively 
our strong financial positions and credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest 
sources of liquidity cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in cash provided by operations in each of the years ended december   and was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our us pension plans of million  million  and million  respectively 
while no contributions are required for our us pension plans in  we continue to monitor the funded status of all pension plans and will evaluate the benefits of future voluntary contributions subject to available liquidity 
increasing raw material costs during the three year period resulted in increased levels of working capital  which had a negative impact on cash provided by operations during each of the three years presented 
in addition to using cash provided by operations  we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs 
at year end  our commercial paper debt outstanding was million 
based upon our current credit rating  we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets 
while not anticipated  if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper  we would draw upon our existing back up credit facility 
in september  we renegotiated our back up credit facility to extend the term to september this credit facility provides million of available financing supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by this bank credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in addition to funds available under this credit facility  we also have the capability of issuing up to approximately million of extendable commercial notes ecns  which are short term instruments whose maturity can be extended to days from the date of issuance 
if these credit facilities and ecns were no longer available to us  we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing costs 
the million credit facility includes a million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries 
as of december   outstanding multicurrency borrowings under the credit facility totaled million 
borrowings from the credit agreement mature in september and are subject to a variable interest rate 
as of december   available capacity on the credit agreement which matures in september was million 
long term debt commercial paper outstanding at december   has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
the related back up credit agreement expires in uses of liquidity capital expenditures capital expenditures were million during  compared to million in  and million in higher levels of expenditures in funded additional capacity for our south american operations to meet strong demand for our shrink bag products and new capacity in our high growth north american production plants 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be in the million to million range  which includes about million of costs related to the design of a new enterprise resource planning system 
after  capital expenditures are expected to return to levels approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses 
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to cents per share from cents per share 
this follows increases of percent in and percent in in february  the board of directors approved the th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to cents per share  a percent increase 
share repurchases during  we purchased  shares of common stock in the open market 
during  we purchased million shares of common stock in the open market 
we did not make any share repurchases during as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to million shares of additional common stock for the treasury 
in february  the board of directors authorized an additional million shares for repurchase 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations and certain other purchase obligations as of december  contractual payments due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years debt payments interest expense capital leases operating leases purchase obligations postretirement obligations these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on september  a portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates 
the amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at december  amount noted also includes estimated interest costs 
the present value of these obligations  excluding interest  is included on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payments terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded bemis supplemental retirement plan 
interest rate swaps our long term unsecured notes include million due in august in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with two us banks  which increased our exposure to variable rates 
we generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term 
these interest rate swap agreements  which expire in  reduced the interest cost of the million of long term debt from percent to about percent in since these variable rates are based upon six month london interbank offered rates libor  calculated in arrears  at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that the fair value of these swaps  which have been designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding  be recorded as an asset or liability of the company 
the fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of million at december   and an asset of million at december  for each period  an offsetting increase is recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding 
these fair value adjustments do not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes  nor do they impact the income statement or related cash flows 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
in connection with the issue of seven year  million notes in march  we entered into a forward starting swap on february   in order to lock in an interest rate in advance of the pricing date for the notes 
on march   in connection with the pricing of the notes  we terminated the swap and recorded the resulting gain of million pre tax on the balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income 
this gain is being amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the notes 
market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates  establish rates for future issuance of public bonds  and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
interest expense calculated on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of total debt outstanding would increase by million 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than nine months 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
the net settlement amount fair value related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contacts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs income  net  which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
the operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of million in and million in operating profit improved by approximately million in and million in as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation 
long term compensation our practice of awarding long term compensation has relied primarily on restricted stock unit programs that are valued at the time of the award and expensed over the vesting period 
beginning in  we discontinued the awarding of stock options 
stock options granted prior to were granted at prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and exercisable  upon vesting  over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant 
stock options for directors vested immediately  while options for company employees generally become vested over three years one third per year 
beginning january   accounting rules require us to follow a fair value based method of recognizing expense for stock options 
the impact to diluted earnings per share for stock options expense in was insignificant 
if we had followed this fair value method prior to  the impact on diluted earnings per share would have been one cent for each year ended and critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
accounting for annual pension costs we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended by fas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
fas no 
requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
pension expense recorded in was million  compared to pension expense of million in and million in effective january   our us defined benefit pension plans were amended for approximately two thirds of the participant population 
for those employees impacted  future pension benefits were replaced with a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the company 
one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets 
as of january   for our us defined benefit pension plans  we have assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be percent 
this is consistent with the rate assumed for and to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation 
using historical long term investment periods of  and years  our pension plan assets have earned rates of return of percent  percent and percent  respectively 
considering these long term results  we selected an percent long term rate of return on assets assumption as of january  using our target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  an increase of one quarter of one percent from the percent rate used at december  pension assumptions sensitivity analysis based upon current assumptions of percent for the discount rate and percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for to be in a range of million to million 
the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
total increase decrease total increase decrease to pension expense to pension expense dollars in millions from current assumptions from current assumptions discount rate rate of return on plan assets percent percent percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent current assumption percent percent percent percent percent percent in accordance with fas no 
 the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset  in the case of an overfunded plan  or as a liability  in the case of an underfunded plan 
the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate 
total increase decrease in accumulated other comprehensive dollars in millions income  net of taxes  from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  condition and amounts of future cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas no 
will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances  and is effective beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we will be required to recognize  in our financial statements  the largest tax benefit of a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained on audit based solely on the technical merits of the position as of the reporting date 
in addition  fin provides guidance on new disclosure requirements  reporting and accrual of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and transition 
fin is effective beginning january   with the cumulative effect of initially applying fin recognized as a change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard and upon implementation do not expect a material impact to the financial statements
