item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following discussion and analysis should be read with the financial statements and accompanying notes  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
it is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating our financial position 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral  controlled release products 
we develop oral  controlled release products using proprietary technology and licenses these products 
our strategy includes improving off patent drug products for life cycle management and developing generic versions of controlled release drug products with high barriers to entry 
our technology is applicable to develop delayed  sustained or targeted release pellets  capsules  tablets  granules and powders 
we have two products  lodrane r and lodrane d r  for treating allergies  currently being sold commercially  and a pipeline of seven drug candidates under development in the therapeutic areas that include pain management  infection and gastrointestinal disorder 
of the products under development  eli  an abuse deterrent oxycodone product  and eli  a once daily oxycodone product  are in clinical trials and we have two generic product candidates that are undergoing pivotal studies 
the addressable market for the pipeline of products exceeds billion 
our facility in northvale  new jersey also is a gmp and dea registered facility for research  development and manufacturing 
at the end of  we entered into a joint venture with vgs pharma  llc and created novel novel  a privately held company specializing in pharmaceutical research  development  manufacturing  licensing  acquisition and marketing of specialty generic pharmaceuticals 
we intend to continue to collaborate in the development of additional products with our current partners 
we also plan to seek additional collaborations to develop more drug products 
we believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce our risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in various therapeutic categories and build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us to share costs of development and to improve cash flow 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgment  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  workers compensation  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies include the recognition of revenue upon completion of certain phases of projects under research and development contracts 
we also assess a need for an allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we assess our exposure to current commitments and contingencies 
it should be noted that actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
during the year ended march   we elected to prospectively recognize the fair value of stock options granted to employees and members of the board of directors  effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which resulted in our taking charges of   and  during the years ended march   and  respectively 
the fair value of stock options held by employees and members of the board of directors which have been granted subsequent to march  is expected to continue to affect the results of operations of future periods  as we continue to grant or reprice stock options to reward our management team 
year ended march  vs 
year ended march  our revenues for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately  over revenues for the comparable prior year  and consisted of  in manufacturing fees and  in royalty fees 
revenues for the year ended march   consisted  in manufacturing fees and  in royalty fees 
the increase in manufacturing fees and royalties was primarily due to the launch of our second product  lodrane d r 
research and development costs for the year ended march   were  an increase of  or approximately from  of such costs for the prior year  primarily the result of increased wages  raw materials  laboratory and manufacturing supplies and consulting fees 
elite now has employees  an increase of from employees one year ago 
the increase in employees is primarily for the scale up work for the pain products and includes manufacturing  analytical and quality assurance people 
elite has also increased its spending on raw materials  primarily api  by from  to  the raw materials are also primarily for scale up of the pain products 
spending on biostudies has increased to  from  a year ago due to spending on the phase ii study for eli research and development costs associated with novel s activities also contribute to the increase 
we expect our research and development costs to continue to increase in future periods primarily due to clinical costs for phase iii and other clinical trials for eli and eli general and administrative expenses g a for the year ended march   were  an increase of  or approximately from  of g a for the prior year 
the increase was attributable to increases in salaries and fringe benefits as a result of increases in staff  consulting fees associated with seeking potential strategic transitions in addition to costs associated with our novel activities 
we are in the initial stages of breaking down the specific costs associated with the research and development of each product on which we devoted resources through the use of detailed time sheets and general ledger account classifications 
in the past  we have not historically allocated these expenses to any particular product 
we cannot estimate the additional costs and expenses that may be incurred in order to potentially complete the development of any product  nor can we estimate the amount of time that might be involved in such development because of the uncertainties associated with the development of controlled release drug delivery products as described in this report 
depreciation and amortization decreased by  from  for the prior year to  the decrease was the result of our taking in the full write off of financing costs associated with the redemption of tax exempt njeda bonds  partially offset by an increase in depreciation in due to acquired new machinery and equipment and upgrading of the corporate and warehouse facilities 
other income expenses for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately  from  for the prior year due to an increase of  in charges related to the issuances of stock options and warrants  offset by i an increase of  in sale of new jersey tax losses  ii additional interest income of  due to higher compensating balances as a result of the private placement and  iii a decrease of  in interest expense resulting from a decrease in njeda bonds outstanding 
as a result of the foregoing  our net loss for the year ended march  was  compared to  for the year ended march  year ended march  vs 
year ended march  our revenues for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately  over revenues for the comparable prior year  and consisted of  in manufacturing fees and  in royalty fees 
revenues for the year ended march   consisted of a  non refundable payment received from purdue pharma lp granting us the right to evaluate certain abuse resistant drug formulation technology   in manufacturing fees   in royalty fees and  in testing fees 
research and development costs for the year ended march  were  an increase of  or approximately  from  of such costs for the comparable period of the prior year  primarily the result of increased wages  raw materials  laboratory and manufacturing supplies and consulting fees 
we expect our research and development costs to continue to increase in future periods as a result of the developing and testing of products currently in our pipeline 
general and administrative expenses g a for the year ended march   were  a decrease of  or approximately from g a for the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in litigation costs  bad debt expense  auditing and legal fees  somewhat offset by increases in salaries and staff 
for the years ended march  and  we were unable to provide a break down of the specific costs associated with the research and development of each product on which we devoted resources because a significant portion of the costs are generally associated with salaries  laboratory supplies  laboratory and manufacturing expenses  utilities and similar expenses 
we have not historically allocated these expenses to any particular product 
in addition  we cannot estimate the additional costs and expenses that may be incurred in order to potentially complete the development of any product  nor can we estimate the amount of time that might be involved in such development because of the uncertainties associated with the development of controlled release drug delivery products as described in this report 
depreciation and amortization increased by  from  for the prior year to  the increase was the result of writing off the balance of the prior njeda bond offering costs as a result of the refinancing 
other income expenses for the year ended march  were  a decrease of  or approximately  from  for the prior year due to i a reduction by  in charges related to the issuances of stock options and warrants  ii an increase of  in sale of new jersey tax losses  and iii additional interest income of  due to higher compensating balances as a result of the private placement  partially offset by an increase of  in interest expense resulting from an increase in njeda bonds outstanding 
as a result of the foregoing  our net loss for the year ended march  was  compared to  for the year ended march  material changes in financial condition our working capital total current assets less total current liabilities  decreased from  as of march  to  primarily due to the net loss of  from operations  exclusive of non cash charges of  we experienced negative cash flows from operations of  for the year ended march   primarily due to our net loss from operations of  less non cash charges of  which included  in connection with the issuance of stock options and warrants  and  in depreciation and amortization expenses 
on november  and on december   elite s partner  ecr  launched lodrane r and lodrane d r  respectively 
under its agreement with ecr  elite is currently manufacturing commercial batches of lodrane r and lodrane d r in exchange for manufacturing margins and royalties on product revenues 
royalty income earned for the year ended march  was  we expect future cash flows from royalties to provide additional cash to help fund our operations 
on june   elite and intellipharmaceutics corp 
ipc  entered into an agreement for the development and commercialization of a controlled released generic drug for certain anti infective diseases by the parties 
we estimate that the product had an addressable market in the us of approximately billion in we are to share in the profits  if any  from the sales of the drug 
on december   the agreement was amended with respect to the development and commercialization of the controlled release drug product in canada 
since ipc intended to enter into an agreement with a canadian company with respect to the development  distribution and sale of the drug product in canada  the parties agreed to suspend their obligations under the agreement with respect to the development and commercialization of the controlled release drug product in canada 
ipc agreed to pay us a certain percentage of any payments received by ipc with respect to the commercialization of the controlled release drug product by such canadian company 
on june   elite and pliva  inc pliva entered into a product development and license agreement providing for the development and license of a controlled released generic anti infective drug formulated by us 
we are to manufacture and pliva will market and sell the product 
under the agreement  the partner is to make milestone payments to us and the development costs are to be paid both by pliva and us  and the profits are to be shared equally 
on june   elite and pliva terminated the product development and license agreement  effective january   and entered into a termination agreement according to which it was agreed that elite owns all intellectual property rights relating to the controlled released generic product under development and pliva agreed to pay elite  in discharge of outstanding payments under the product development and license agreement 
on january   elite entered into a product development and commercialization agreement with orit laboratories llc orit providing that we and orit will co develop and commercialize an extended release drug product for treatment of anxiety  and upon completion of development  the possible licensing of the product for manufacture and sale 
the parties intend to develop all dose strengths of the product 
we are to share in the profits  if any from the sales of the drug 
the term of the agreement is for the longer of i years from the date the product is first commercially sold to a third party  or ii the life of the applicable patent s  if any 
the agreement is automatically renewable for year periods unless terminated by either party by providing the other party with twelve months written notice prior to any renewal period 
in january  the fda accepted our ind for eli  its once a day oxycodone painkiller 
under the new drug application  we will begin our development program with an early stage study to evaluate eli s sustained release formation 
currently there is no once daily oxycodone available  we estimate that the us market for sustained release  twice daily oxycodone was about billion as of september  no assurance can be given that we will consummate any of the transactions discussed above or that any material revenues will be generated for us therefrom 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended march   we recorded negative cash flow and financed our operations through utilization of our existing cash 
our working capital at march  was million compared with working capital of million at march  cash and cash equivalents at march  were million  a decrease of million from the million at march  we spent approximately  on improvements and machinery and equipment during the year ended march  on april   we sold in a private placement through oppenheimer company  inc  the placement agent the placement agent   shares of our series c preferred stock  at a price of  per share  each share convertible at per share into shares of common stock  or an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the investors also acquired warrants to purchase shares of common stock  exercisable on or prior to april  the warrants represent the right to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the gross proceeds of the sale were  before payment of  in commissions to the placement agent and selected dealers 
we also paid certain legal fees and expenses of counsel to the placement agent 
we issued to the placement agent and its designees five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with similar terms to the warrants issued to the investors with an exercise price of per share 
we expect that the approximate  of net proceeds will contribute materially to our efforts to advance our portfolio of pain products through the clinic as well as accelerate the development of our other controlled release products which utilize our proprietary oral drug delivery systems and abuse resistant technology 
from time to time we will consider potential strategic transactions including acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies 
we retained an investment banking firm to assist with our efforts 
there can be no assurance that any such transaction will be available or consummated in the future 
as of march   our principal source of liquidity was approximately  of cash and cash equivalents 
after the closing of the private placement in april  our principal source of liquidity was approximately  of cash and cash equivalents 
we intend to sell the remaining  shares of such series c preferred stock  together with warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  which should result in gross proceeds of up to  additionally  we may have access to funds through the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants in addition to funds that may be generated from the potential sale of new jersey tax losses
