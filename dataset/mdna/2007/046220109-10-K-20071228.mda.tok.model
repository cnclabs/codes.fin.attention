table of contents part i item business 
overview the company acquires  manages  collects and services portfolios of consumer receivables for its own account 
these portfolios generally consist of one or more of the following types of consumer receivables charged off receivables accounts that have been written off by the originators and may have been previously serviced by collection agencies  semi performing receivables accounts where the debtor is currently making partial or irregular monthly payments  but the accounts may have been written off by the originators  and performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making regular monthly payments that may or may not have been delinquent in the past 
we acquire these consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the total amounts actually owed by the debtors 
we acquire these portfolios after a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying receivables and calculate the purchase price so that our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our investment after servicing expenses 
after purchasing a portfolio  we actively monitor its performance and review and adjust our collection and servicing strategies accordingly 
we purchase receivables from creditors and others through privately negotiated direct sales  brokered transactions and auctions in which sellers of receivables seek bids from several pre qualified debt purchasers 
these receivables consist primarily of mastercard r  visa r  private label credit card accounts  and telecommunication charge offs  among other types of receivables 
we pursue new acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios from originators of consumer debt  on an ongoing basis through our relationships with industry participants  collection agencies  investors and our financing sources  brokers who specialize in the sale of consumer receivable portfolios  and other sources 
our objective is to maximize our return on investment in acquired consumer receivable portfolios 
as a result  before acquiring a portfolio  we analyze the portfolio to determine how to best maximize collections in a cost efficient manner and decide whether to use our internal servicing and collection department  third party collection agencies and attorneys  or a combination of all three options 
if we elect to outsource the servicing of receivables  our management typically determines the appropriate third party collection agencies and attorneys based on the type of receivables purchased 
once a group of receivables is sent to third party collection agencies and attorneys  our management actively monitors and reviews the third party collection agencies and attorneys performance on an ongoing basis 
based on portfolio performance considerations  our management either will move certain receivables from one third party collection agency or attorney to another or to our internal servicing department if it anticipates that this will result in an increase in collections or it will sell the portfolio 
additionally  we have a collection center  which currently employs approximately staff  including senior management and has the capacity for more than employees 
these employees assist us in monitoring our third party collection agencies and attorneys  and give us greater flexibility for servicing a percentage of our consumer receivable portfolios in house 
we acquire portfolios through a combination of internally generated cash flow and bank debt 
in the past  on certain large portfolio acquisitions we have partnered with a large financial institution in which we shared in the finance income generated from the collections on the portfolios 
for the years ended september   and  our finance income was approximately million  million and million  respectively  and our net income was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during these same years our net cash collections were approximately million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents we were formed in as an affiliate of asta group  incorporated  an entity owned by arthur stern  our chairman of the board and an executive vice president  gary stern  our president and chief executive officer  and other members of the stern family  to purchase  at a small discount to face value  retail installment sales contracts secured by motor vehicles 
we became a public company in november in  we decided to capitalize on our management s more than years of experience and expertise in acquiring and managing consumer receivable portfolios for asta group 
as a result  we ceased purchasing automobile contracts and  with the assistance and financial support of asta group and a partner  purchased our first significant consumer receivable portfolio 
since then  asta group ceased acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and  accordingly  does not compete with us 
industry overview the purchasing  servicing and collection of charged off  semi performing and performing consumer receivables is a growing industry that is driven by increasing levels of consumer debt  increasing defaults of the underlying receivables  and increasing utilization of third party providers to collect such receivables 
we believe that as a result of the difficulty in collecting these receivables and the desire of originating institutions to focus on their core businesses and to generate revenue from these receivables  originating institutions are increasingly electing to sell these portfolios 
strategy our primary objective is to utilize our management s experience and expertise to effectively grow our business by identifying  evaluating  pricing and acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and maximizing collections of such receivables in a cost efficient manner 
our strategy includes managing the collection and servicing of our consumer receivable portfolios  including outsourcing a majority of those activities to maintain low fixed overhead  selling accounts on an opportunistic basis  generally when our efforts have been exhausted through traditional collecting methods  when pricing is at our indifference point  or when we can capitalize on pricing during times when we feel the pricing environment is high  expanding financial flexibility through increased capital and lines of credit  capitalizing on our strategic relationships to identify and acquire consumer receivable portfolios  and expanding our business through the purchase of consumer receivables from new sources and consisting of different asset classes 
we believe that as a result of our management s experience and expertise  and the fragmented yet growing market in which we operate  we are well positioned to successfully implement our strategy 
we are a delaware corporation whose principal executive offices are located at sylvan avenue  englewood cliffs  new jersey we were incorporated in new jersey on july  and were reincorporated in delaware on october  as a result of a merger with a delaware corporation 
consumer receivables business receivables purchase program we purchase bulk receivable portfolios that include charged off receivables  semi performing receivables and performing receivables 
these receivables consist primarily of mastercard r  visa r  private label credit card accounts  and telecom receivables  among other types of receivables 
from time to time  we may acquire directly  and indirectly through the consumer receivable portfolios that we acquire  secured consumer asset portfolios 

table of contents we identify potential portfolio acquisitions on an ongoing basis through our relationships with industry participants  collection agencies  investors and our financing sources  brokers who specialize in the sale of consumer receivable portfolios  and other sources 
historically  the purchase prices of the consumer receivable portfolios we have acquired have ranged from less than  to approximately  however we acquired one portfolio in march for million 
as a part of our strategy to acquire consumer receivable portfolios  we have  from time to time  entered into  and may continue to enter into  participation and profit sharing agreements with our sources of financing and our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
these arrangements may take the form of a joint bid  with one of our third party collection agencies and attorneys or financing source who assists in the acquisition of a portfolio and provides us with more favorable non recourse financing terms or a discounted servicing commission 
we utilize our relationships with brokers  third party collection agencies and attorneys  and sellers of portfolios to locate portfolios for purchase 
our senior management is responsible for coordinating due diligence  including  in some cases  on site visits to the seller s office  stratifying and analyzing the portfolio characteristics  valuing the portfolio  preparing bid proposals  negotiating pricing and terms  negotiating and executing a purchase contract  closing the purchase  and coordinating the receipt of account documentation for the acquired portfolios 
the seller or broker typically supplies us with either a sample listing or the actual portfolio being sold through an electronic form of media 
we analyze each consumer receivable portfolio to determine if it meets our purchasing criteria 
we may then prepare a bid or negotiate a purchase price 
if a purchase is completed  management monitors the portfolio s performance and uses this information in determining future buying criteria and pricing 
after determining that an investment will yield an adequate return on our acquisition cost after servicing fees  we use a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the estimated cash flows 
as previously mentioned  included in our analysis for purchasing a portfolio of receivables and determining a reasonable estimate of collections and the timing thereof  the following variables are analyzed and factored into our original estimates the number of collection agencies previously attempting to collect the receivables in the portfolio  the average balance of the receivables  the age of the receivables as older receivables might be more difficult to collect or might be less cost effective  past history of performance of similar assets as we purchase portfolios of similar assets  we believe we have built significant history on how these receivables will liquidate and cash flow  number of days since charge off  payments made since charge off  the credit originator and their credit guidelines  the locations of the debtors as there are better states to attempt to collect in and ultimately we have better predictability of the liquidations and the expected cash flows 
conversely  there are also states where the liquidation rates are not as good and that is factored into our cash flow analysis  
table of contents jobs or property of the debtors found within portfolios with our business model  this is of particular importance 
debtors with jobs or property are more likely to repay their obligation and conversely  debtors without jobs or property are less likely to repay their obligation  and the ability to obtain customer statements from the original issuer 
we will obtain and utilize as appropriate input from our third party collection agencies and attorneys  as further evidentiary matter  to assist us in developing collection strategies and in modeling the expected cash flows for a given portfolio 
once a receivable portfolio has been identified for potential purchase  we prepare various analyses based on extracting customer level data from external sources  other than the issuer  to analyze the potential collectibility of the portfolio 
we also analyze the portfolio by comparing it to similar portfolios previously acquired by us 
in addition  we perform qualitative analyses of other matters affecting the value of portfolios  including a review of the delinquency  charge off  placement and recovery policies of the originator as well as the collection authority granted by the originator to any third party collection agencies  and  if possible  by reviewing their recovery efforts on the particular portfolio 
after these evaluations are completed  members of our senior management discuss the findings  decide whether to make the purchase and finalize the price at which we are willing to purchase the portfolio 
we purchase most of our consumer receivable portfolios directly from originators and other sellers including  from time to time  our third party collection agencies and attorneys through privately negotiated direct sales and through auction type sales in which sellers of receivables seek bids from several pre qualified debt purchasers 
we also  from time to time  use the services of brokers for sourcing consumer receivable portfolios 
in order for us to consider a potential seller as a source of receivables  a variety of factors are considered 
sellers must demonstrate that they have adequate internal controls to detect fraud  the ability to provide post sale support  and the capacity to honor put back and return warranty requests 
generally  our portfolio purchase agreements provide that we can return certain accounts to the seller within a specified time period 
however  in some transactions  we may acquire a portfolio with few  if any  rights to return accounts to the seller 
after acquiring a portfolio  we conduct a detailed analysis to determine which accounts in the portfolio should be returned to the seller 
although the terms of each portfolio purchase agreement differ  examples of accounts that may be returned to the seller include debts paid prior to the cutoff date  debts in which the consumer filed bankruptcy prior to the cutoff date  debts in which the consumer was deceased prior to cutoff date  and fraudulent accounts 
significant accounts returned to sellers for the fiscal year ended amounted to approximately million for two portfolio purchases 
such accounts were non compliant accounts 
accounts returned to sellers for fiscal years and have been determined to be immaterial 
our purchase agreements generally do not contain any provision for a limitation on the number of accounts that can be returned to the seller 
we generally use third parties to determine bankrupt and deceased accounts  which allows us to focus our resources on portfolio collections 
under a typical portfolio purchase agreement  the seller refunds the portion of the purchase price attributable to the returned accounts or delivers replacement receivables to us 
occasionally  we will acquire a well seasoned  or older  portfolio at a reduced price from a seller that is unable to meet all of our purchasing criteria 
when we acquire such portfolios  the purchase price is discounted beyond the typical discounts we receive on the portfolios we purchase that meet our purchasing criteria 
in february  we acquired vativ recovery llc  vativ located in sugar land  texas 
vativ recovery systems llc provides bankruptcy and deceased account servicing 
the acquisition of vativ provides 
table of contents asta with internal experience and proprietary systems in support of servicing our own bankruptcy and deceased accounts  while also affording us the opportunity to enter new markets for acquisitions in the bankruptcy and deceased account fields 
receivable servicing our objective is to maximize our return on investment on acquired consumer receivable portfolios 
as a result  before acquiring a portfolio  we analyze the portfolio to determine how to best maximize collections in a cost efficient manner and decide whether to use our internal servicing and collection department or third party collection agencies and attorneys 
therefore  if we are successful in acquiring the portfolios  we can promptly process the receivables that were purchased and commence the collection process 
unlike collection agencies that typically have only a specified period of time to recover a receivable  as the portfolio owners we have significantly more flexibility and can establish payment programs 
once a portfolio has been acquired  we or our third party collection agencies or attorneys generally download all receivable information provided by the seller into our account management system and reconcile certain information with the information provided by the seller in the purchase contract 
we or our third party collection agencies or attorneys send notification letters to obligors of each acquired account explaining  among other matters  our new ownership and asking that the obligor contact us 
in addition  we notify the three major credit reporting agencies of our new ownership of the receivables 
we presently outsource the majority of our receivable servicing to third party collection agencies and attorneys 
our senior management typically determines the appropriate third party collection agency and attorneys based on the type of receivables purchased 
once a group of receivables is sent to a third party collection agency or attorney  our management actively monitors and reviews the third party collection agencies and attorneys performance on an ongoing basis 
our management receives detailed analyses  including collection activity and portfolio performance  from our internal servicing departments to assist it in evaluating the results of the efforts of the third party collection agencies and attorneys 
based on portfolio performance guidelines  our management will move certain receivables from one third party collection agency or attorney to another  or to our internal servicing department if it anticipates that this will result in an increase in collections 
we have a collection center that currently employs approximately experienced persons with the capacity for over employees 
this facility provides the majority of our internal collection and servicing capabilities  giving us flexibility and control over the servicing of our consumer receivables portfolios and assists us in monitoring our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
we have four main internal servicing departments collection skiptrace  legal  customer service  and accounting 
collection skiptrace 
the collection skiptrace department is responsible for making contact with the obligors and collecting on our consumer receivable portfolios that are not being serviced by third party collection agencies and attorneys 
this department uses a friendly  customer service approach to collect on receivables 
through the use of our collection software and telephone system  each collector is responsible for contacting customers  explaining the benefits of making payment on the obligations  and working with the customers to develop acceptable means to satisfy their obligations 

table of contents we and our third party collection agencies and attorneys have the flexibility to structure repayment plans that accommodate the needs of obligors by offering obligors a discount on the overall obligation  and or tailoring repayment plans that provide for the payment of these obligations as a component of the obligor s monthly budget 
we also use a series of collection letters  late payment reminders  and settlement offers that are sent out at specific intervals or at the request of a member of our collection department 
when the collection department cannot contact the customer by either telephone or mail  the account is referred to the skiptrace department 
the skiptrace department is responsible for locating and contacting customers who could not be contacted by either the collection or legal departments 
the skiptrace employees use a variety of public and private third party databases to locate customers 
once a customer is located and contact is made by a skiptracer  the account is then referred back to the collection or legal department for follow up 
the skiptrace department is also responsible for finding current employers and locating assets of obligors when this information is deemed necessary 
legal 
if the collection department determines that the customer has the ability to satisfy his obligation but our normal collection activities have not resulted in any resolution of the customer s obligations  the account is referred to the legal department  which consists of non lawyer administrative staff experienced in collection work 
the legal department refers legal case proceedings to outside counsel 
the legal department also refers accounts to the skiptrace department to obtain a current phone number  address  the location of assets of the obligor or the identity of the obligor s employer 
in addition  the legal department communicates with the collection attorneys that we utilize throughout the country 
over the past two and a half years  we have employed a more aggressive legal strategy that we believe will yield more collections over a longer period of time 
customer service 
the customer service department is responsible for handling incoming calls from debtors and third party collection agencies that are responsible for collecting on our consumer receivable portfolios  coordinating customer inquiries and assisting the collection agencies in the collection process  handling buy back and information requests from companies who have purchased receivables from us  working with the buyers during the transition period and post sale process  and handling any issues that may arise once a receivable portfolio has been sold 
accounting 
in addition to the customary accounting activities  the accounting department is responsible for making daily deposits of customer payments  posting these payments to the customer s account  mailing monthly statements to customers  and in conjunction with the customer service department  providing senior management with weekly and monthly receivable activity and performance reports 
accounting employees also assist collection department employees in handling customer disputes with regard to payment and balance information 
the accounting department also assists the customer service department in the handling of buy back requests from companies who have purchased receivables from us 
in addition  the accounting department reviews the results of the collection of consumer receivable portfolios that are being serviced by third party collection agencies and attorneys 
collections represented by account sales certain collections represent account sales to other debt buyers to help maximize revenue and cash flows 
we feel that our business model of not having a large number of collectors  coupled with a legal strategy which is 
table of contents focused on attempting to attach liens and judgments on obligors  allows us the flexibility to sell accounts at prices that are attractive to us and as important  sell the less desirable accounts within our collective portfolios 
there are many factors that contribute to the decision of which receivable to sell and which to service  including the age of the receivables  the status of the receivables whether paying or non paying  and the selling price 
collections represented by account sales for the fiscal years ended september   and were million  million and million  respectively 
collections represented by account sales as a percentage of total collections for the fiscal years ended september   and were  and  respectively 
marketing the company has established relationships with brokers who market consumer receivable portfolios from banks  finance companies and other credit providers 
in addition  the company subscribes to national publications that list consumer receivable portfolios for sale 
the company also directly contacts banks  finance companies or other credit providers to solicit consumer receivables for sale 
competition our business of purchasing distressed consumer receivables is highly competitive and fragmented  and we expect that competition from new and existing companies will increase 
we compete with other purchasers of consumer receivables  including third party collection companies  and other financial services companies who purchase consumer receivables 
some of our competitors are larger and more established and may have substantially greater financial  technological  personnel and other resources than we have  including greater access to the capital market system 
we believe that no individual competitor or group of competitors has a dominant presence in the market 
we compete with our competitors for consumer receivable portfolios based on many factors  including purchase price  representations  warranties and indemnities requested  speed in making purchase decisions  and reputation of the purchaser 
our strategy is designed to capitalize on the market s lack of a dominant industry player 
we believe that our management s experience and expertise in identifying  evaluating  pricing and acquiring consumer receivable portfolios and managing collections coupled with our strategic alliances with third party collection agencies and attorneys and our sources of financing give us a competitive advantage 
however  we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not increase in the future 
management information systems we believe that a high degree of automation is necessary to enable us to grow and successfully compete with other finance companies 
accordingly  we continually upgrade our computer hardware and  when necessary  our software to support the servicing and recovery of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation 
our telecommunications and computer systems allow us to quickly and accurately process large amounts of data necessary to purchase and service consumer receivable portfolios 
in addition  we rely on the information technology of our third party collection agencies and attorneys and periodically review their systems to ensure that they can adequately service our consumer receivable portfolios 

table of contents due to our desire to increase productivity through automation  we periodically review our systems for possible upgrades and enhancements 
government regulation the relationship of a consumer and a creditor is extensively regulated by federal  state and municipal laws  rules  regulations and ordinances 
these laws include  but are not limited to  the following federal statutes and regulations the federal truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair credit reporting act  as well as comparable statutes in states where consumers reside and or where creditors are located 
among other things  the laws and regulations applicable to various creditors impose disclosure requirements regarding the advertisement  application  establishment and operation of credit card accounts or other types of credit programs 
federal law requires a creditor to disclose to consumers  among other things  the interest rates  fees  grace periods and balance calculation methods associated with their accounts 
in addition  consumers are entitled to have payments and credits applied to their accounts promptly  to receive proscribed notices and to require billing errors to be resolved promptly 
in addition  some laws prohibit certain discriminatory practices in connection with the extension of credit 
further  state laws may limit the interest rate and the fees that a creditor may impose on consumers 
failure by the creditors to have complied with applicable laws could create claims and rights of offset by consumers that would reduce or eliminate their obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
pursuant to agreements under which we purchase receivables  we are typically indemnified against losses resulting from the failure of the creditor to have complied with applicable laws relating to the receivables prior to our purchase of such receivables 
certain laws  including the laws described above  may limit our ability to collect amounts owing with respect to the receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part 
for example  under the federal fair credit billing act  a credit card issuer may be subject to certain claims and defenses arising out of certain transactions in which a credit card is used if the consumer has made a good faith attempt to obtain satisfactory resolution of a problem relative to the transaction and  except in cases where there is a specified relationship between the person honoring the card and the credit card issuer  the amount of the initial transaction exceeds and the place where the initial transaction occurred was in the same state as the consumer s billing address or within miles of that address 
accordingly  as a purchaser of defaulted receivables  we may purchase receivables subject to valid defenses on the part of the consumer 
other laws provide that  in certain instances  consumers cannot be held liable for  or their liability is limited to with respect to  charges to the credit card credit account that were a result of an unauthorized use of the credit card account 
no assurances can be given that certain of the receivables were not established as a result of unauthorized use of a credit card account  and  accordingly  the amount of such receivables may not be collectible by us 
several federal  state and municipal laws  rules  regulations and ordinances  including  but not limited to  the federal fair debt collection practices act fdcpa and the federal trade commission act and comparable state statutes regulate consumer debt collection activity 
although  for a variety of reasons  we may not be specifically subject to the fdcpa and certain state statutes specifically addressing third party debt collectors  it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in our collection activities 
additionally  our third party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these laws 
to the extent that some or all of these laws apply to our collection activities or our third party collection agencies and attorneys collection activities  failure to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on us 
additional laws may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables 
such new laws may adversely affect the ability to collect the receivables 
we currently hold a number of licenses issued under applicable consumer credit laws 
certain of our current licenses and any licenses that we may be required to obtain in the future may be subject to periodic renewal provisions and or other requirements 
our inability to renew licenses or to take any other required action with respect to such licenses could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operation and financial condition 
employees as of september   we had full time employees 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement

risk factors 
you should carefully consider these risk factors in evaluating the company 
in addition to the following risks  there may also be risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial that may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  results of operation or financial condition could be adversely affected  the trading price of our common stock could decline and shareholders might lose all or part of their investment 
the company has risks associated with its recent portfolio purchase agreement 
on february   palisades acquisition xv  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  entered into a purchase and sale agreement the portfolio purchase agreement with great seneca financial corporation  platinum financial services corporation  monarch capital corporation  colonial credit corporation  centurion capital corporation  sage financial corporation and hawker financial corporation collectively  the sellers  under which we agreed to acquire a portfolio of approximately billion in face value receivables the portfolio purchase for a purchase price of million plus of any future net payments as defined in the portfolio purchase agreement received by the company after the company has received net payments equal to of the purchase price plus our cost of funds 
the portfolio now owned by palisades acquisition xvi  llc palisades xvi predominantly consists of credit card accounts and includes some accounts in collection litigation and accounts as to which the sellers have been awarded judgments 
the transaction was consummated on march  under the portfolio purchase agreement  we assumed certain risks associated with the portfolio purchase 
the representations and warranties with respect to the portfolio which we received from the sellers have limitations both in scope and  in certain cases  duration  including a limitation of our put back rights with respect to certain types of claims  a requirement that certain claims be brought within days of closing or be deemed waived  and a limitation with respect to the sellers responsibilities for acts of prior owners 
other than the representations contained in the portfolio purchase agreement  the accounts were sold as is 
no assurances can be given that we will have an adequate remedy if our understandings about the quality  quantity and characteristics of the accounts in the portfolio prove to be contrary to our expectations 
we may not be able to satisfy our obligation under our receivable financing agreement 
the receivable financing agreement required that the principal amount thereunder be reduced under a schedule tied to projected collections on the portfolio purchase 
as we fell behind the minimum required amortization schedule  principally as a result of sales of accounts that were built into that schedule  and since currently we believe that our strategy of suing debtors will ultimately realize more than the sales of these accounts would produce  the company and its lender entered into an amendment dated december  the amendment allows us greater flexibility to use our strategy and substantially eliminates any scheduled sales of accounts used in the original expectations 
additionally  the amendment effectively extends the repayment schedule from months to months 
while we believe that we will be able to satisfy the new collection schedule  no assurances can be given that collections will not slow further  notwithstanding our recent engagement of a sub servicer to assist with collection of this portfolio purchase  as described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
such slowing of collections could cause us to fall behind the schedule and default on our obligations under the amended receivable financing agreement 
the anticipated benefits of the portfolio purchase may not meet our expectations 
the portfolio purchase increased our assets acquired for liquidation by more than  so that our near term future operating results are highly dependent on the returns realized from the portfolio purchase 
while we believe that we have the capability to manage such a significantly increased asset base  no assurances can be given that we will not experience operational difficulties internally or with our third party collection agencies and attorneys in managing an asset base of this size 
further  while we believe that the returns on the portfolio purchase will be at least as favorable as our historic 
table of contents returns on smaller portfolio purchases  no assurances can be given with respect to our initial evaluation of the quality of the assets in the portfolio nor with respect to our ability to manage the portfolio profitably 
we have incurred substantial debt from time to time in connection with our purchase of consumer receivable portfolios  particularly with respect to the portfolio purchase agreement  and may incur further debt in the future which could affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns 
to finance the portfolio purchase  we needed to incur substantial indebtedness 
on february   upon execution of the portfolio purchase agreement  we were required to provide the seller with a million deposit  which we did by utilizing substantially all of the availability under our existing million credit facility 
we made a second deposit payment of million on february   which we did by amending our existing line of credit to increase availability temporarily from million to million  with reduction targets set to april  which were met 
the remaining million was paid in full at the closing of the portfolio purchase on march   by borrowing approximately million inclusive of transaction costs under a new receivables financing agreement entered into by palisades xvi  with a major financial institution as the funding source  consisting of debt with full recourse only to palisades xvi  and bearing an interest rate which approximates basis points over libor 
the term of the agreement is three years 
all assets of palisades xvi  principally the portfolio purchase  are pledged to secure such borrowing  and all proceeds received as a result of the net collections from this portfolio purchase are to be applied to interest and principal of the underlying loan 
the company made certain representations and warranties to the lender to support the transaction 
as of september  the balance due on the receivable financing agreement was million 
on december   we signed the sixth amendment to the fourth amended and restated loan agreement with a consortium of banks that temporarily increases the total revolving loan commitment from  to  the temporary increase of  is required to be repaid by february  in the event the increase is not repaid by february   the then outstanding portion of the temporary increase shall be repaid over a six month period 
the outstanding balance under this line of credit at september  was approximately million 
our ability to grow through this line may be limited as we are approaching the upper limit of our borrowing availability and we may need to seek additional financing 
as of september   palisade xvi  the company s indirect wholly owned subsidiary  was required to remit an additional million to its lender in order to be in compliance under the receivable financing agreement 
the company facilitated the ability of palisades xvi to make this payment by borrowing million under its current revolving credit facility and causing another of its subsidiaries to purchase a portion of the portfolio purchase from palisade xvi at a price of million prior to the measurement date under the receivable financing agreement 
the receivable financing agreement required that the principal amount thereunder be reduced under a schedule tied to projected collections on the portfolio purchase 
as we fell behind the minimum required amortization schedule  principally as a result of sales of accounts that were built into that schedule  and since currently we believe that our strategy of suing debtors will ultimately realize more than the sales of these accounts would produce  the company and its lender entered into an amendment dated december  the amendment allows us greater flexibility to use our strategy and substantially eliminates any scheduled sales of accounts used in the original expectations 
additionally  the amendment effectively extends the repayment schedule from months to months 
while we believe that we will be able to satisfy the new collection schedule  no assurance can be given that collections will not slow further  notwithstanding our recent engagement of a sub servicer to assist with collection of this portfolio purchase  as described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
such slowing of collections could cause us to fall behind the schedule and default on our obligations under the amended receivable financing agreement 

table of contents by incurring such substantial indebtedness and by incurring additional indebtedness from time to time in connection with the purchase of consumer receivable portfolios in the future  we are subject to the risks associated with incurring such indebtedness  including we are required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs and  as a result  we will have less funds available for operations  future acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios  and other purposes  it may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds through financings  if available at all  we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates  less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general economic conditions  and if we defaulted under our existing credit facilities or if our creditors demanded payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness  we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments 
we have pledged all of our portfolios of consumer receivables to secure our borrowings and are subject to covenants that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
as we borrow funds to purchase portfolios we may fully utilize our availability under that facility and no future borrowings are permitted under the new receivables financing agreement 
this may place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to less leveraged companies 
any indebtedness that we incur under our existing line of credit is collateralized by all of our portfolios of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation  except the portfolio purchase only collateralizes the receivables financing agreement 
if we default under the indebtedness secured by our assets  including failure to comply with borrowing base requirements  those assets would be available to the secured creditor to satisfy our obligations to the secured creditor 
in addition  our credit facility imposes certain restrictive covenants  including financial covenants and borrowing base requirements 
failure to satisfy any of these covenants could result in all or any of the following acceleration of the payment of our outstanding indebtedness  cross defaults to and acceleration of the payment under other financing arrangements  our inability to borrow additional amounts under our existing financing arrangements  and our inability to secure financing on favorable terms or at all from alternative sources 
any of these consequences could adversely affect our ability to acquire consumer receivable portfolios and operate our business 
we may not be able to purchase consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices or on sufficiently favorable terms or at all 
our success depends upon the continued availability of consumer receivable portfolios that meet our purchasing criteria and our ability to identify and finance the purchases of such portfolios 
the availability of consumer receivable portfolios at favorable prices and on terms acceptable to us depends on a number of factors outside of our control  including the continuation of the current growth trend in consumer debt  the continued volume of consumer receivable portfolios available for sale  competitive factors affecting potential purchasers and sellers of consumer receivable portfolios  and possible future changes in the bankruptcy laws  state laws and homestead acts which could make it more difficult for us to collect 

table of contents we may not be able to continually replace our defaulted consumer receivables 
to operate profitably  we must continually acquire a sufficient amount of distressed consumer receivables to generate continued revenue 
furthermore  we cannot predict how our ability to identify and purchase receivables and the quality of those receivables would be affected if there is a shift in consumer lending practices whether caused by changes in the regulations or accounting practices applicable to debt buying and sustained economic downturn 
we have seen at certain times that the market for acquiring consumer receivable portfolios has become more competitive  thereby diminishing from time to time our ability to acquire such receivables at prices we are willing to pay 
the growth in consumer debt may also be affected by a slowdown in the economy  problems in the credit and housing markets  reductions in consumer spending  changes in the underwriting criteria by originators  and changes in laws and regulations governing consumer lending 
any slowing of the consumer debt growth trend could result in a decrease in the availability of consumer receivable portfolios for purchase that could affect the purchase prices of such portfolios 
any increase in the prices we are required to pay for such portfolios in turn will reduce the profit  if any  we generate from such portfolios 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline 
because of the nature of our business  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our results may fluctuate as a result of any of the following the timing and amount of collections on our consumer receivable portfolios  our inability to identify and acquire additional consumer receivable portfolios  a decline in the estimated future value of our consumer receivable portfolio recoveries  increases in operating expenses associated with the growth of our operations  general and economic market conditions  and prices we are willing to pay for consumer receivable portfolios 
our projections of future cash flows from our portfolio purchases may prove to be inaccurate  which could result in reduced revenues or the recording of an impairment charge if we do not achieve the collections forecasted by our model 
we use qualitative and quantitative analysis to project future cash flows from our portfolio purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to achieve the collections forecasted by our analysis 
if we are not able to achieve these levels of forecasted collection  our revenues will be reduced or we may be required to record an impairment charge  which could result in a reduction of our earnings 
for the year ended september   we recorded impairment charges of million 
impairments were taken on eleven portfolios as relative collections compared to our expectations on these portfolios were deteriorating  and this deterioration was confirmed by our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
accordingly  we believed that impairment charges were necessary 

table of contents we may not be able to recover sufficient amounts on our consumer receivable portfolios to recover the costs associated with the purchase of those portfolios and to fund our operations 
we acquire and collect on consumer receivable portfolios that contain charged off  semi performing and performing receivables 
in order to operate profitably over the long term  we must continually purchase and collect on a sufficient volume of receivables to generate revenue that exceeds our costs 
for accounts that are charged off or semi performing  the originators or interim owners of the receivables generally have made numerous attempts to collect on these obligations  often using both their in house collection staff and third party collection agencies  subsequently deemed these obligations as uncollectible  and charged off these obligations 
these receivable portfolios are purchased at significant discounts to the amount the consumers owe 
these receivables are difficult to collect and actual recoveries may vary and be less than the amount expected 
in addition  our collections may worsen in a weak economic cycle 
we may not recover amounts in excess of our acquisition and servicing costs 
our ability to recover on our portfolios and produce sufficient returns can be negatively impacted by the quality of the purchased receivables 
in the normal course of our portfolio acquisitions  some receivables may be included in the portfolios that fail to conform to certain terms of the purchase agreements and we may seek to return these receivables to the seller for payment or replacement receivables 
however  we cannot guarantee that any of such sellers will be able to meet their payment obligations to us 
accounts that we are unable to return to sellers may yield no return 
if cash flows from operations are less than anticipated as a result of our inability to collect sufficient amounts on our receivables  our ability to satisfy our debt obligations  purchase new portfolios and our future growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to intense competition for the purchase of consumer receivable portfolios 
we compete with other purchasers of consumer receivable portfolios  with third party collection agencies and with financial services companies that manage their own consumer receivable portfolios 
we compete on the basis of price  reputation  industry experience and performance 
some of our competitors have greater capital  personnel and other resources than we have 
the possible entry of new competitors  including competitors that historically have focused on the acquisition of different asset types  and the expected increase in competition from current market participants may reduce our access to consumer receivable portfolios 
aggressive pricing by our competitors could raise the price of consumer receivable portfolios above levels that we are willing to pay  which could reduce the number of consumer receivable portfolios suitable for us to purchase or if purchased by us  reduce the profits  if any  generated by such portfolios 
if we are unable to purchase receivable portfolios at favorable prices or at all  our finance income and earnings could be materially reduced 
we are dependent upon third parties to service a majority of our consumer receivable portfolios 
although we utilize our in house collection staff to collect some of our receivables  we outsource a majority of our receivable servicing 
as a result  we are dependent upon the efforts of our third party collection agencies and attorneys to service and collect our consumer receivables 
however  any failure by our third party collection agencies and attorneys to adequately perform collection services for us or remit such collections to us could materially reduce our finance income and our profitability 
in addition  our finance income and profitability could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to secure replacement third party collection agencies and attorneys and redirect payments from the debtors to our new third party collection agencies and attorneys promptly in the event our agreements with our third party collection agencies and attorneys are terminated  our third party collection agencies and attorneys fail to adequately perform their obligations or if our relationships with such third party collection agencies and attorneys adversely change 

table of contents we rely on our third party collectors to comply with all rules and regulations and maintain proper internal controls over their accounting and operations 
because the receivables were originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal and or state laws by a variety of entities and involved consumers in all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and outside the united states  there can be no assurance that all original servicing entities have at all times been in substantial compliance with applicable law 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we or our third party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law 
the failure to comply with applicable law and not maintain proper controls in their accounting and operations could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs and fines and penalties 
our collections may decrease if bankruptcy filings increase 
during times of economic recession  the amount of defaulted consumer receivables generally increases  which contributes to an increase in the amount of personal bankruptcy filings 
under certain bankruptcy filings  a debtor s assets are sold to repay credit originators  but since the defaulted consumer receivables we purchase are generally unsecured we often would not be able to collect on those receivables 
we cannot assure you that our collection experience would not decline with an increase in bankruptcy filings 
if our actual collection experience with respect to a defaulted consumer receivables portfolio is significantly lower than we projected when we purchased the portfolio  our earnings could be negatively affected 
if we are unable to access external sources of financing  we may not be able to fund and grow our operations 
we depend on loans from our credit facility and other external sources in part  to fund and expand our operations 
our ability to grow our business is dependent on our access to additional financing and capital resources 
the failure to obtain financing and capital as needed would limit our ability to purchase consumer receivable portfolios  and achieve our growth plans 
in addition  our financing sources impose certain restrictive covenants  including financial covenants 
failure to satisfy any of these covenants could cause our indebtedness to become immediately payable  preclude us from further borrowings from these existing sources  and prevent us from securing alternative sources of financing necessary to purchase consumer receivable portfolios and to operate our business 
we use estimates for recognizing finance income on substantially all of our consumer receivable portfolio investments and our earnings would be reduced if actual results are less than estimated 
we utilize the interest method of revenue recognition for determining our income recognized on finance receivables  which is based on projected cash flows that may prove to be less than anticipated and could lead to reductions in revenue or impairment charges under the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop accounting for loans or certain securities acquired in a transfer 
under the guidance of sop and the amended practice bulletin  static pools of accounts are established 
these pools are aggregated based on certain common risk criteria 
each static pool is recorded at cost and is accounted for as a single unit for the recognition of income  principal payments and loss provision 
once a static pool is established for a quarter  individual receivable accounts are not added to the pool unless replaced by the seller or removed from the pool unless sold or returned to the seller 
sop and the amended practice bulletin requires that the excess of the contractual cash flows over expected cash flows not be recognized as an adjustment of revenue or expense or on the balance sheet 
the sop initially freezes the internal rate of return  referred to as irr  estimated when the accounts receivable are purchased as the basis for subsequent impairment testing 
significant increases in actual  or expected future cash flows may be recognized prospectively through an 
table of contents upward adjustment of the irr over a portfolio s remaining life 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing 
effective for fiscal years beginning october  under sop and the amended practice bulletin  rather than lowering the estimated irr if the collection estimates are not received or projected to be received  the carrying value of a pool would be written down to maintain the then current irr 
any reduction in our earnings could materially adversely affect our stock price 
we may rely on third parties to locate  identify and evaluate consumer receivable portfolios available for purchase 
we may rely on third parties  including brokers and third party collection agencies and attorneys  to identify consumer receivable portfolios and  in some instances  to assist us in our evaluation and purchase of these portfolios 
as a result  if such third parties fail to identify receivable portfolios or if our relationships with such third parties are not maintained  our ability to identify and purchase additional receivable portfolios could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if we  or such parties fail to correctly or adequately evaluate the value or collectibility of these consumer receivable portfolios  we may pay too much for such portfolios and suffer an impairment and our earnings could be negatively affected 
the loss of an asset type could impact our ability to acquire receivable portfolios 
in the event one of the asset classes of receivables which we purchase is no longer available to us  our purchases may decline and our results might suffer 
we may not be successful at acquiring receivables of new asset types or in implementing a new pricing structure 
we may pursue the acquisition of receivable portfolios of asset types in which we have little current experience 
we may not be successful in completing any acquisitions of receivables of these asset types and our limited experience in these asset types may impair our ability to collect on these receivables 
this may cause us to pay too much for these receivables  and consequently  we may not generate a profit from these receivable portfolio acquisitions 
the loss of any of our executive officers may adversely affect our operations and our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios 
arthur stern  our chairman and executive vice president  gary stern  our president and chief executive officer  and mitchell cohen  our chief financial officer are responsible for making substantially all management decisions  including determining which portfolios to purchase  the purchase price and other material terms of such portfolio acquisitions 
these decisions are instrumental to the success of our business 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios 
the stern family effectively controls asta  substantially reducing the influence of our other stockholders 
members of the stern family including arthur stern  gary stern and barbara marburger  daughter of arthur stern and sister of gary stern  trusts or custodial accounts for the benefit of minor children of barbara marburger and gary stern  asta group  incorporated  and limited liability companies controlled by judith r

in addition  other members of the stern family  such as adult children of gary stern and barbara marburger  own additional shares 
as a result  the stern family is able to influence significantly the actions that require stockholder approval  including the election of a majority of our directors  and the approval of mergers  sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval 

table of contents as a result  our other stockholders may have little or no influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval 
in addition  the stern family s influence could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us and consequently materially adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we have experienced rapid growth over the past several years  which has placed significant demands on our administrative  operational and financial resources and could result in an increase in our expenses 
we plan to continue our growth  which could place additional demands on our resources and cause our expenses to increase 
future internal growth will depend on a number of factors  including the effective and timely initiation and development of relationships with sellers of consumer receivable portfolios and strategic partners  our ability to maintain the collection of consumer receivables efficiently  and the recruitment  motivation and retention of qualified personnel 
sustaining growth will also require the implementation of enhancements to our operational and financial systems and will require additional management  operational and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or that we will be able to maintain or accelerate our growth or attract additional management talent and any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to generate finance income and control our expenses 
government regulations may limit our ability to recover and enforce the collection of our receivables 
federal  state and municipal laws  rules  regulations and ordinances may limit our ability to recover and enforce our rights with respect to the receivables acquired by us 
these laws include  but are not limited to  the following federal statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder and comparable statutes in states where consumers reside and or where creditors are located the fair debt collection practices act  the federal trade commission act  the truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act  the equal credit opportunity act  and the fair credit reporting act 
we may be precluded from collecting receivables we purchase where the creditor or other previous owner or third party collection agency and attorney failed to comply with applicable law in originating or servicing such acquired receivables 
laws relating to the collection of consumer debt also directly apply to our business 
our failure to comply with any laws applicable to us  including state licensing laws  could limit our ability to recover on receivables and could subject us to fines and penalties  which could reduce our earnings and result in a default under our loan arrangements 
in addition  our third party collection agencies and attorneys may be subject to these and other laws and their failure to comply with such laws could also materially adversely affect our finance income and earnings 
additional laws may be enacted that could impose additional restrictions on the servicing and collection of receivables 
such new laws may adversely affect the ability to collect on our receivables  which could also adversely affect our finance income and earnings 
because our receivables are generally originated and serviced pursuant to a variety of federal and or state laws by a variety of entities and may involve consumers in all states  the district of columbia and puerto rico  there can be no assurance that all original servicing entities have at all times been in substantial compliance with applicable law 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we or our third party collection agencies and attorneys have been or will continue to be at all times in substantial compliance with applicable law 
failure to comply with 
table of contents applicable law could materially adversely affect our ability to collect our receivables and could subject us to increased costs  fines and penalties 
class action suits and other litigation in our industry could divert our management s attention from operating our business and increase our expenses 
certain originators and third party collection agencies and attorneys in the consumer credit industry have been subject to class actions and other litigation 
claims include failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and improper or deceptive origination and servicing practices 
if we become a party to such class action suits or other litigation  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may seek to make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources 
we may seek to grow asta through acquisitions of related businesses 
such acquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance  including the diversion of our management s attention from our everyday business activities  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business  the contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of  and other unanticipated problems arising in  the acquired business  and the need to expand management  administration and operational systems 
if we make such acquisitions we cannot predict whether we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses into our business  we will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions  or there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions 
in addition  future acquisitions by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  and the recognition of significant charges for depreciation and amortization related to goodwill impairment and other intangible assets 
although we have no present plans or intentions  we continuously evaluate potential acquisitions of related businesses 
however  we have not reached any agreement or arrangement with respect to any particular future acquisition and we may not be able to complete any acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 
our investments in other businesses and entry into new business ventures may adversely affect our operations 
we have and may continue to make investments in companies or commence operations in businesses and industries that are not identical to those with which we have historically been successful 
if these investments or arrangements are not successful  our earnings could be materially adversely affected by increased expenses and decreased finance income 
if our technology and phone systems are not operational  our operations could be disrupted and our ability to successfully acquire receivable portfolios could be adversely affected 
our success depends  in part  on sophisticated telecommunications and computer systems 
the temporary loss of our computer and telecommunications systems  through casualty  operating malfunction or service provider failure  could disrupt our operations 
in addition  we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to properly bid on prospective acquisitions of receivable portfolios and to access  maintain and 
table of contents expand the databases we use for our collection and monitoring activities 
any failure of our information systems and their backup systems would interrupt our operations 
we may not have adequate backup arrangements for all of our operations and we may incur significant losses if an outage occurs 
in addition  we rely on third party collection agencies and attorneys who also may be adversely affected in the event of an outage in which the third party collection agencies and attorneys do not have adequate backup arrangements 
any interruption in our operations or our third party collection agencies and attorneys operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our organizational documents and delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation of our board of directors and management 
several provisions of our organizational documents and delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt  including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of our common stock 
under the terms of our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
the ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current board of directors 
in addition  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the date hereof 
of these shares   are held by our affiliates and are saleable under rule of the securities act of  as amended 
the remainder of our outstanding shares were freely tradeable 
in addition  options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were outstanding as of september   of which  were vested 
the exercise prices of such options were substantially lower than the current market price of our common stock 
we may also issue additional shares in connection with our business and may grant additional stock options or restricted shares to our employees  officers  directors and consultants under our present or future equity compensation plans or we may issue warrants to third parties outside of such plans 
as of september  there were  shares available for such purpose with such shares available under the equity compensation plan and the stock option plan 
no more options are available for issuance under the stock option plan 
if a significant portion of these shares were sold in the public market  the market value of our common stock could be adversely affected 
from time to time  the company s chairman  arthur stern and president and chief executive officer  gary stern adopted prearranged stock trading plans in accordance with guidelines specified by rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
while no such plans are in effect at present  significant sales by the stern family could have an adverse effect on market prices for our common stock 
the company recently purchased a portfolio in a south american country exposing the company to currency rate fluctuations 
as a result of this purchase  the company will be exposed to currency rate fluctuations as the collections on this portfolio will be denominated in the local currency of the south american country 
additionally  our investment could also be exposed to the same currency risk 
a strengthened us dollar could decrease the us dollar equivalent of the local currency collections  and our currency conversion to us dollars would suffer

unless the context otherwise requires  the terms we  us the company  or our as used herein refer to asta funding  inc and our subsidiaries 
overview we are primarily engaged in the business of acquiring  managing  servicing and recovering on portfolios of consumer receivables 
these portfolios generally consist of one or more of the following types of consumer receivables charged off receivables accounts that have been written off by the originators and may have been previously serviced by collection agencies  semi performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making partial or irregular monthly payments  but the accounts may have been written off by the originators  and performing receivables accounts where the debtor is making regular monthly payments that may or may not have been delinquent in the past 
we acquire these consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the amount actually owed by the borrowers 
we acquire these portfolios after a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the underlying receivables and calculate the purchase price so that our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our acquisition costs and servicing expenses 
after purchasing a portfolio  we actively monitor its performance and review and adjust our collection and servicing strategies accordingly 
we purchase receivables from credit grantors and others through privately negotiated direct sales and auctions in which sellers of receivables seek bids from several pre qualified debt purchasers 
we pursue new acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios on an ongoing basis through our relationships with industry participants  collection agencies  investors and our financing sources  brokers who specialize in the sale of consumer receivable portfolios  and other sources 
critical accounting policies we account for our investments in consumer receivable portfolios  using either the interest method  or the cost recovery method 
as we believe our extensive liquidating experience in certain asset classes such as distressed credit card receivables  telecom receivables  consumer loan receivables  retail installment contracts  mixed consumer 
table of contents receivables  and auto deficiency receivables has matured  we use the interest method for accounting for substantially all asset acquisitions within these classes of receivables when we believe we can reasonably estimate the timing of the cash flows 
in those situations where we diversify our acquisitions into other asset classes where we do not possess the same expertise or history  or we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the cash flows  we utilize the cost recovery method of accounting for those portfolios of receivables 
over time  as we continue to purchase asset classes to the point where we believe we have developed the requisite expertise and experience  we are more likely to utilize the interest method to account for such purchases 
prior to october   the company accounted for its investment in finance receivables using the interest method under the guidance of practice bulletin each purchase was treated as a separate portfolio of receivables and was considered a separate financial investment  and accordingly we did not aggregate such loans under practice bulletin as the underlying collateral had similar characteristics 
as sop was adopted by the company for our fiscal year beginning october   we began aggregating portfolios of receivables acquired sharing specific common characteristics which were acquired within a given quarter 
we currently consider for aggregation portfolios of accounts  purchased within the same fiscal quarter  that generally meet the following characteristics same issuer originator same underlying credit quality similar geographic distribution of the accounts similar age of the receivable and same type of asset class credit cards  telecom etc 
after determining that an investment will yield an adequate return on our acquisition cost after servicing fees  including court costs which are expensed as incurred  we use a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the estimated cash flows 
as previously mentioned  included in our analysis for purchasing a portfolio of receivables and determining a reasonable estimate of collections and the timing thereof  the following variables are analyzed and factored into our original estimates the number of collection agencies previously attempting to collect the receivables in the portfolio  the average balance of the receivables  the age of the receivables as older receivables might be more difficult to collect or might be less cost effective  past history of performance of similar assets as we purchase portfolios of similar assets  we believe we have built significant history on how these receivables will liquidate and cash flow  number of days since charge off  payments made since charge off  the credit originator and their credit guidelines  the locations of the debtors as there are better states to attempt to collect in and ultimately we have better predictability of the liquidations and the expected cash flows 
conversely  there are also states where the liquidation rates are not as good and that is factored into our cash flow analysis  jobs or property of the debtors found within portfolios with our business model  this is of particular importance 
debtors with jobs or property are more likely to repay their obligation and conversely  debtors without jobs or property are less likely to repay their obligation  and the ability to obtain customer statements from the original issuer 
we will obtain and utilize as appropriate input from our third party collection agencies and attorneys  as further evidentiary matter  to assist us in developing collection strategies and in modeling the expected cash flows for a given portfolio 
we acquire accounts that have experienced deterioration of credit quality between origination and the date of our acquisition of the accounts 
the amount paid for a portfolio of accounts reflects our determination that it is 
table of contents probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the portfolio of accounts contractual terms 
we consider the expected payments and estimate the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows for each acquired portfolio coupled with expected cash flows from accounts available for sales 
the excess of this amount over the cost of the portfolio  representing the excess of the account s cash flows expected to be collected over the amount paid  is accreted into income recognized on finance receivables over the expected remaining life of the portfolio 
we believe we have significant experience in acquiring certain distressed consumer receivable portfolios at a significant discount to the amount actually owed by underlying debtors 
we acquire these portfolios only after both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the underlying receivables are performed and a calculated purchase price is paid so that we believe our estimated cash flow offers us an adequate return on our costs including servicing expenses 
additionally  when considering larger portfolio purchases of accounts  or portfolios from issuers from whom we have little or limited experience  we have the added benefit of soliciting our third party collection agencies and attorneys for their input on liquidation rates and at times incorporate such input into the price we offer for a given portfolio and the estimates we use for our expected cash flows 
typically  when purchasing portfolios for which we have the experience detailed above  we have expectations of recovering return of our invested capital back within an month time frame and expectations of collecting in the range of of our invested capital over years 
historically  we have generally been able to achieve these results and we continue to use this as our basis for establishing the original cash flow estimates for our portfolio purchases 
we routinely monitor these results against the actual cash flows and  in the event the cash flows are below our expectations and we believe there are no reasons relating to mere timing differences or explainable delays such as can occur particularly when the court system is involved for the reduced collections  an impairment would be recorded as a provision for credit losses 
conversely  in the event the cash flows are in excess of our expectations and the reason is due to timing  we would defer the excess collection as deferred revenue 
results of operations the following discussion of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
years ending september  finance income other income equity in earnings of venture total revenue general and administrative expenses interest expense impairments income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september  compared to the year ended september  finance income 
for the year ended september   finance income increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  the increase in finance income primarily resulted from an increase in the average outstanding level of consumer receivable accounts acquired for liquidation during the year ended september   as compared to the prior year  coupled with the effect of adjustments to accretable yields on certain portfolios 
the average level of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation increased from million for the year ended september  to million for the same 
table of contents period in the increase in the average level of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation is due primarily to the portfolio purchase in march during the year ended september   we acquired consumer receivable portfolios at a cost of million as compared to million during the prior year 
during the year ended september   commissions and fees associated with gross collections from our third party collection agencies and attorneys increased million  or  to million from million for year ended september  the increase is indicative of a shift to the suit strategy implemented by the company and includes advances of court costs by our legal network  and by us 
while the dollar amount has increased  the cost as a percentage of collections decreased during the year ended the slight percentage decrease reflects slightly lower rates charged by the servicers of the large portfolio and other portfolios they service for us 
our network of attorneys typically advance the cost of suing debtors 
these court costs are recovered by our attorneys from collections received from debtor payments 
during the fourth quarter ended september   the company accrued million for lawsuits commenced against debtors  primarily for the portfolio purchase 
we do anticipate expending court costs during fiscal year on the portfolio purchase in order to accelerate the suit process 
as we continue to purchase portfolios and utilize our third party collection agencies and attorney networks  the contingency fees should stabilize in the range of gross collections based upon the current mix of portfolios 
adjustments to accretable yields on certain portfolios were made based on available information  and based on improved liquidation rates from our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
management believes the anticipated collections on these portfolios to be in excess of our original projections 
as we believe these improved liquidation rates will continue on these portfolios  we adjusted our accretable yields by million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
finance income related to the accretable yield reclassifications during the year ended september  was approximately million 
while our expectations on our fiscal year purchases are lower than in the prior year  the portfolios still fit our investment criteria 
income recognized from fully amortized portfolios zero based revenue was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase is due primarily to more pools which were fully amortized in the forth quarter of  and were predominantly derived from credit card purchases from one issuer made in and and telecom portfolios purchased from through collections with regard to the billion face value portfolio purchased in the second quarter of fiscal year  the portfolio purchase were million through september   which includes approximately million of accounts returned to the seller  and finance income earned was million 
other income 
other income of million for the year ended september  includes interest income from banks and other loan instruments substantially acquired in  which were collected during the fourth quarter of equity in earnings of venture 
in august  the company invested approximately million for a interest in a newly formed venture 
the venture invested in a bankruptcy liquidation that will collect on existing rental contracts and the liquidation of inventory 
the investment is expected to return to the company its normal expected investment result over a two to three year period 
the company s share of the income was  during the year ended september  the company has received approximately million in cash distributions from the inception of the venture through september  subsequent to september   and through december  an additional  has been received by the company 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses excluding income taxes for the year ended september  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in receivable servicing expenses during the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  the increase in receivable servicing expenses resulted from the substantial increase in our average number of accounts acquired for liquidation  primarily due to the portfolio purchase in the second quarter of a majority of the increased costs were from collection expenses  consulting and skiptracing fees further described below  salaries  payroll taxes and benefits  professional fees  telephone charges and travel costs  as we are visiting our third party collection agencies and attorneys on a more frequent basis for financial and operational audits 

table of contents in december  the company negotiated an agreement with a third party servicer  to assist the company in the asset location  skiptracing efforts and ultimately the suing of debtors with respect to the portfolio purchase 
the agreement calls for a percent fee on substantially all gross collections from the portfolio purchase on the first million and on substantially all collections from the portfolio purchase in excess of million 
this fee will be charged from march and we believe this arrangement will enhance our collection efforts 
additionally  the company will pay this third party servicer a monthly fee of  per month for twenty four months for its consulting and skiptracing efforts in connection with the portfolio purchase 
this fee began in may interest expense 
for the year ended september   interest expense increased to million from million during the year ended september   and represented of total expenses excluding income taxes for the year ended september  the increase was due to an increase in average outstanding borrowings under our line of credit and our new million receivables financing agreement during the year ended september   as compared to the average outstanding borrowings during the year ended september   coupled with higher interest rates during the year ended september  the average interest rate excluding unused credit line fees for the year ended september  was as compared to during the year ended september  the average outstanding borrowings increased from million to million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase in borrowings was due to the increase in acquisitions of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation during the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  impairments 
impairments of million were recorded by the company during the year ended september  as compared to million for the year ended september   and represented of total expenses excluding income taxes for the year ended september  impairments were taken on eleven portfolios during the year ended including nine portfolios in the fourth quarter of as relative collections with respect to our expectations on these portfolios were deteriorating in the fourth quarter  and this deterioration was confirmed by our third party collection agencies and attorneys  we believed that impairment charges became necessary 
net income 
for the year ended september   net income increased million  or to million from million for the year ended september  net income per share for the year ended september  increased per diluted share  or to per diluted share  from per diluted share for the year ended september  year ended september  compared to the year ended september  finance income 
for the year ended september   finance income increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  the increase in finance income was primarily due to an increase in finance income earned on consumer receivables acquired for liquidation  which resulted from an increase in the average outstanding accounts acquired for liquidation during the fiscal year ended september   as compared to the same prior year period  coupled with the effect of increased yields on certain portfolios 
for the fiscal year ended september   we acquired receivables at a cost of million as compared to million for the year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   we had an average of million in consumer receivables acquired for liquidation as compared to million for the year ended september   a increase 
finance income recognized from collections represented by account sales was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively  while collections represented by account sales decreased by  or million from million to million 
this decrease is primarily due to the sales of certain portfolios purchased in with higher rates of return primarily recognized in adjustments to accretable yields on certain portfolios were made based on available information  and based on improved liquidation rates attained and forecasted to be attained by our third party collection agencies and attorneys 
management believes the anticipated collections on these portfolios to be in excess of our original projections 
as we believe these improved liquidation rates will continue  we adjusted our accretable yields by million which impacted revenue this year and will impact revenue in future years as well 
income recognized from fully amortized portfolios zero based revenue was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to the sale of fully amortized pools during 
table of contents in the company decided to increase its utilization of the legal process to increase collections 
this strategy has proven to be effective to date  as we continue to utilize this strategy 
the commissions and fees associated with gross collections from our third party collection agencies and attorneys were approximately million  or of gross collections  in the fiscal year ended september   as compared to million  or of gross collections in the prior year 
as we continue to purchase portfolios and utilize our third party collection agencies and attorney networks  we anticipate these costs will rise  however the contingency fees should stabilize in the range of to of gross collections based upon the current mix of portfolios 
other income 
other income of  for the year ended september  includes service fee income generated by vativ and interest income from banks and other loan instruments 
equity in earnings of venture 
in august the company invested approximately million for a interest in a newly formed venture 
the venture invested in a bankruptcy liquidation that will collect on existing rental contracts and the liquidation of inventory 
the investment is expected to return to the company its normal expected investment results over a two to three year period 
the company s share of the income of  in is primarily due to sales of the higher valued inventory early in the venture s life 
the company received approximately million through september  in cash distributions from the venture and an additional million through november  as returns of its investment 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to an increase in the administrative costs associated with the increase in the accounts acquired for liquidation 
the increase in the administrative expenses included increased media costs  technology costs  salaries  and related benefits  professional fees  telephone charges and rent 
interest expense 
for the year ended september   interest expense increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to the increase in the average outstanding borrowings under our line of credit during the year ended september   as compared to the same prior year period 
the average outstanding balance during the year ended september  was million as compared to million for the period ended september  also  the average interest rate for the year  excluding unused credit line fees  increased to from in net income 
for the year ended september   net income increased million or to million from million for the year ended september  net income per share for the year ended september  increased per diluted share or to per diluted share from per diluted share for the year ended september  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash from operations include collections on the receivable portfolios that we have acquired 
our primary uses of cash include our purchases of consumer receivable portfolios 
we rely significantly upon our lenders to provide the funds necessary for the purchase of consumer and commercial accounts receivable portfolios 
as of september   we had a million line of credit for portfolio purchases  with an expandable feature which allows the company the ability to increase the line to million with consent of the banks 
as of september   there was a million outstanding balance under this facility 
although we are within the borrowing limits of this facility  there are certain restrictions in place with regard to collateralization whereby the company may be limited in its ability to borrow funds to purchase additional portfolios 
on march  the company signed the third amendment to fourth amended and restated loan agreement the credit agreement with a consortium of banks that amended certain terms of the credit agreement  whereby the parties agreed to a temporary overadvance of million to be reduced to zero on or before may  in addition  the parties agreed to an increase in interest rate  to libor plus basis points for libor loans  an increase from basis points 
the rate is subject to adjustment each quarter upon delivery of results that evidence a need for an adjustment 
as of may   the temporary overadvance was approximately million 
on may   the company signed the fourth amendment to the credit agreement whereby the parties agreed to revise certain terms of the agreement which eliminated the temporary overadvance provision 
on june  the company signed the fifth amendment to the fourth amended and restated loan agreement the credit agreement with a 
table of contents consortium of banks that amended certain terms of the credit agreement whereby the parties agreed to further amend the definition of the borrowing base and increase the advance rates on portfolio purchases allowing the company more borrowing availability 
on december   the company signed the sixth amendment to the fourth amended and restated loan agreement the credit agreement with a consortium of banks that temporarily increases the total revolving loan commitment from  to  the increase of  is required to be repaid by february  in the event the increase is not repaid by february   the then outstanding portion of the temporary increase shall be repaid over a six month period 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we made purchases totaling million  which put us close to the upper limit of our credit line 
the increase will enable us to make more portfolio acquisitions as the opportunity arises 
in march  palisades acquisition xvi  llc palisades xvi  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company purchased a portfolio of approximately billion in face value receivables for a purchase price of million plus of net payments after we recover of the purchase price plus our cost of funds 
the portfolio is made up of predominantly credit card accounts and includes accounts in collection litigation and accounts as to which the sellers have been awarded judgments and other traditional charge offs 
the company paid a deposit of million  fully using its existing credit facility  as modified in february the remaining million was paid on march   by borrowing approximately million inclusive of transaction costs under a new receivables financing agreement entered into by palisades xvi with a major financial institution as the funding source  and consists of debt with full recourse only to palisades xvi  bearing an interest rate of approximately basis points over libor 
the term of the agreement is three years 
all proceeds received as a result of the net collections from this portfolio are applied to interest and principal of the underlying loan 
the company made certain representations and warranties to the lender to support the transaction 
the portfolio is serviced by palisades collection  llc  a wholly own subsidiary of the company  which has engaged a subservicer for the portfolio 
as of september   there was a million outstanding balance under this facility 
as of september   our cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million from million at september  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended september   was due to an increase in cash flows used in investing activities primarily due to the increase in purchases of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation  a special dividend paid and higher interest payments  offset by an increase in cash provided by operating activities due to primarily an increase in net income for the year and an increase in cash provided by financing activities  primarily due to the increase in borrowings under lines of credit during the year ended september   as compared to the year net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended september   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during the year ended september  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net income  an increase in interest payable as a result of higher borrowings  offset a decrease in income taxes payable and an increase in amounts due from third party collection agencies and attorneys  and an increase in deferred income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended september   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million during the year ended september  the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of accounts acquired for liquidation  including the portfolio purchase of billion of face value consumer receivables at a cost of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended september   as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended september  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in borrowings under our lines of credit and our new receivable financing agreement to finance the portfolio purchase 
in addition  there was million of cash designated as restricted cash at september  there was no restricted cash at the end of the prior year 
as of september   palisade xvi  the company s indirect wholly owned subsidiary  was required to remit and additional million to its lender in order to be in compliance under the receivable financing agreement 
the company facilitated the ability of palisades xvi to make this payment by borrowing million under its current revolving credit facility and causing another of its subsidiaries to purchase a portion of the 
table of contents portfolio purchase from palisade xvi at a price of million prior to the measurement date under the receivable financing agreement 
our cash requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
we depend on external financing to acquire consumer receivables 
during the year ended september   we acquired consumer receivable portfolios at a cost of approximately million 
these acquisitions were financed with our cash flows from operating activities and primarily with our existing and new credit facilities 
as we are approaching the upper limit of our borrowing availability  we may seek additional financing for further growth 
the receivable financing agreement required that the principal amount thereunder be reduced under a schedule tied to projected collections on the portfolio purchase 
as we fell behind the minimum required amortization schedule  principally as a result of sales of accounts that were built into that schedule  and since currently we believe that our strategy of suing debtors will ultimately realize more than the sales of these accounts would produce  the company and its lender entered into an amendment dated december  the amendment allows us greater flexibility to use our strategy and substantially eliminates any scheduled sales of accounts used in the original expectations 
additionally  the amendment effectively extends the repayment schedule from months to months 
while we believe that we will be able to satisfy the new collection schedule  no assurances can be given that collections will not slow further  notwithstanding our recent engagement of a sub servicer to assist with collection of this portfolio purchase  as described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
such slowing of collections could cause us to fall behind the schedule and default on our obligations under the amended receivable financing agreement 
we anticipate the funds available under our current credit facility and cash from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated cash requirements for at least the next months 
if for any reason our available cash otherwise proves to be insufficient to fund operations because of future changes in the industry  general economic conditions  unanticipated increases in expenses  or other factors  we may be required to seek additional funding 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions of related businesses but we may not be able to complete any acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 
we may consider possible acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses 
any such possible acquisitions or investments may be material and may require us to incur a significant amount of debt or issue a significant amount of equity securities 
further  any business that we acquire or invest in will likely have its own capital needs  which may be significant  and which we may be called upon to satisfy

when we pay higher prices for portfolios which are performing or fresher  we believe it is not at the sacrifice of our expected returns

business combinations fasb statement no 
the objective of fasb statement no 
r  is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
to accomplish that  this statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer a 
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree b 
recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase c 
determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 

table of contents fasb statement no 
r applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity the acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses the acquirer  including those sometimes referred to as true mergers or mergers of equals and combinations achieved without the transfer of consideration  for example  by contract alone or through the lapse of minority veto rights 
fasb statement no 
r applies to all business entities  including mutual entities that previously used the pooling of interests method of accounting for some business combinations

the acquisition of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a business c 
a combination between entities or businesses under common control d 
a combination between not for profit organizations or the acquisition of a for profit business by a not for profit organization 
fasb statement no 
r retains the guidance in fasb statement no 
for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
fasb statement no 
r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values at that date 
fasb statement no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  an entity may not apply it before that date 
currently  the company does not anticipate fasb statement no 
r will have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 

fasb statement no 
a noncontrolling interest  sometimes called a minority interest  is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
the objective of fasb statement no 
is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified  labeled  and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently 
a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary changes if the parent purchases additional ownership interests in its subsidiary or if the parent sells some of its ownership interests in its subsidiary 
it also changes if the subsidiary reacquires some of its ownership interests or the subsidiary issues additional ownership interests 
all of those transactions are economically similar  and this statement requires that they be accounted for similarly  as equity transactions 
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value 
the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment 
entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
fasb statement no 
applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations  but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary

the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 

currently the company does not anticipate fasb statement no 
will have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the board s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
this statement is effective for the company s fiscal year that begins october  the company believes that the statement  when adopted  will not impact the company 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab became effective for the company in the current fiscal year 
adoption had no material impact on the company 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r fasb 
fasb improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income of a business entity 
fasb also improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
fasb was required to be implemented by the end of our fiscal year at this time  the company does not sponsor a defined benefit plan  therefore  there is no impact on the company with regard to fasb in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
fasb statement no 
will be effective for our financial statements issued for our fiscal year beginning october  we do not expect the adoption of fasb statement no 
to have a material impact on our financial reporting  and we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of fasb statement no 
will have on our disclosure requirements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin will be effective for our fiscal year beginning october  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial reporting and disclosure 

table of contents inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended september   and seasonality and trends our management believes that our operations may  to some extent  be affected by high delinquency rates and by lower recoveries on consumer receivables acquired for liquidation during or shortly following certain holiday periods and during the summer months 
in addition  on occasion the market for acquiring distressed receivables does become more competitive thereby possibly diminishing our ability to acquire such distressed receivables at attractive prices in such periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes and changes in corporate tax rates 
a material change in these rates could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
at september   our million credit facility  all of which is variable rate debt  had an outstanding balance of million and our receivable financing agreement  all of which is variable rate debt  had an outstanding balance of million 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased our annual interest expense by approximately  based on the average debt obligation outstanding during the fiscal year 
we do not currently invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments
