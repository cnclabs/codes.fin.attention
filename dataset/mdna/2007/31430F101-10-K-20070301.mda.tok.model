table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we completed with a increase in our hotel revenue per available room  or revpar  compared to this was the third year of revpar increases following a three year decline in revpar 
the fundamentals of the lodging industry appear to be strong  as evidenced by the national trend of increased revpar and increases in average daily room rates  or adr  which is responsible for the increase in revpar in the current year 
the increase in adr was also a major factor in a basis point increase in our hotel earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization margin  or hotel ebitda margin  for our hotels in continuing operations 
hotel ebitda margin is a commonly used non gaap measure described in more detail and reconciled to gaap measures in the non gaap financial measures section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition 
we completed amendments to our management agreements with intercontinental hotels group plc  or ihg  in january this enabled us to start the process of selling non strategic hotels  of which were operated under management agreements with ihg 
these non strategic hotels were generally located in slower growth markets with low barriers to entry and required capital investments not meeting our return criteria 
during  we sold of these non strategic hotels  leaving non strategic hotels  which we expect to sell in early the hotels sold in provided gross proceeds of million  which were used to pay down debt of approximately million and invested in capital improvements at many of our core hotels 
in  we embarked on a three year capital improvement program  affecting our entire core portfolio  designed to enhance our competitive position 
during  we spent million on capital expenditures  of this  approximately million related to capital items committed in and million related to our three year capital improvement program 
we expect to spend approximately million in and  at the completion of this renovation program in  we will have made major capital investments aggregating approximately million 
as a result of the strong economy and the related impact on the travel and lodging industries  and our lower secured debt levels  standard poor s raised its ratings on our senior unsecured debt twice in from b to b and from b to b  and in moody s investor services raised our debt ratings from b to ba as a result of the moody s upgrade in april  the interest rate applicable to million of our senior unsecured debt maturing in decreased from to  reducing our annualized interest expense by million 
during  we paid down debt of approximately million  refinanced another million of debt and reduced interest rates by on million of senior debt 
the combined effect of these actions will result in reducing our annual interest expense by million and lowering our weighted average cost of debt by basis points 
in december  we resumed paying a common dividend with a per share dividend  which was also paid in the first quarter of for the second and third quarters of  our board of directors increased the dividend to per share  and in the fourth quarter it was increased once again to per share

for the year  revpar increased from to 
the increase in revpar was made up of an increase in adr while occupancy dropped to 
we attribute the increase in revpar to a nationwide lodging industry recovery  improved hotel performance following major capital projects completed in and and a concerted effort to change our customer mix to higher adr business 
we expect revpar to continue increasing in and that improvements in adr will continue to drive revpar growth 
increases in adr generally result in increases in hotel ebitda margins 
we have seen a firming of hotel ebitda margin at our hotels  which improved from in to in  and we expect to see further improvement in as adr continues to be a significant factor in revpar improvement 
we are focused on working with our brand managers to control the expense growth that typically occurs during a lodging industry recovery  improve our hotel ebitda margins and manage renovation displacement to minimize their impact on hotel ebitda margins 
refined investment strategy by amending of our agreement with ihg we were able to sell certain non strategic hotels and use the proceeds to reduce debt and invest in high return on investment capital projects at our remaining core hotels 
we plan on spending approximately million on hotel capital improvements from through as we focus on improving our core portfolio through renovation and repositioning  we believe our portfolio will be positioned to have above average growth 
any future acquisition efforts will focus on higher quality hotels in markets with significant barriers to entry  such as central business districts and resort locations 
hotel brand and market segment will be secondary concerns when we are considering investment opportunities 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded net income applicable to common stockholders of million  compared to a net loss of million in we had income from continuing operations of million compared to a prior year loss from continuing operations of million 
a significant item impacting the current year income from continuing operations was an aggregate of million of charges related to the early retirement of debt 
contributing to the loss from continuing operations were million in losses from hurricanes  million of charges related to the early retirement of debt and million of impairment charges  recorded under the provisions of sfas total revenue from continuing operations increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue is principally attributed to a increase in revpar compared to the increase in revpar resulted from increases in adr net of a slight drop in occupancy and represents industry revpar increases in most of our major markets 
the lodging industry nationwide continues to experience increased demand  but there have been only limited increases in room supply leading to strong improvements in revpar in many markets 
our increase in adr was higher than the overall industry average partly because of our 
table of contents concentrated efforts to change the mix of our business to higher adr business 
increased adr typically improves hotel ebitda margin because the hotels are receiving more revenue for each guest 
in  our hotel ebitda margin improved basis points over largely because of the increased adr 
total operating expenses increased by million but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
hotel departmental expenses  which consist of rooms expense  food and beverage expense  and other operating departments  increased million compared to  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to  largely from improvements in labor costs as a percentage of total revenue 
hotel departmental expenses are directly related to the number of hotel guests and should continue to improve as a percentage of total revenue as rates increase 
other property operating costs  which consist of general and administrative costs  marketing costs  repairs and maintenance  utilities expense  and other costs  increased million compared to  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
all of the other property operating costs remained constant or decreased as a percent of total revenue compared to management and franchise fees increased million compared to and increased slightly as a percentage of total revenue  from to 
the increase as a percentage of total revenue is related to additional incentive fees earned by our management companies 
taxes  insurance and lease expense increased million compared to but decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue from to 
we had increases as a percentage of total revenue in percentage lease expense and property insurance  but this was more than offset by decreases as a percentage of total revenue in general liability insurance and property tax expense 
percentage lease expense is computed as a percentage of hotel revenues in excess of a base rent 
therefore  as revenues increase  percentage rent expense increases at a faster rate 
property insurance reflects the nationwide trend of increases in rates related to catastrophic coverage 
corporate expenses increased by million compared to and increased slightly as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase in corporate expenses is attributed to severance costs related to several executives that left the company in and additional asset management positions related to our modified asset management approach 
depreciation expense increased by million compared to the increase in depreciation expense reflects the large capital expenditures spent in and net interest expense decreased by million in compared to the principal reason for the reduction in interest expense is attributed to reduction in average debt outstanding during of million  a basis point decrease in our weighted average interest rate and a million increase in capitalized interest 
during  we refinanced million of senior notes and million of mortgage debt at lower interest rates 
as the result of strong economy  its impact on the travel and lodging industry and our lower secured debt levels  standard poor s and moody s investor services upgraded their ratings on our senior debt  resulting in a basis point decrease in the interest rate on million of our senior debt 
the increase in capitalized interest is related to the expanded capital renovation program at our hotels and the construction loan on our royale palms condominium development in myrtle beach  south carolina  which we expect to repay in the second quarter of the early retirement of debt in resulted in net debt extinguishment costs of million  of which was recorded in discontinued operations 
in  we recorded million in debt extinguishment costs  of which million was recorded in discontinued operations 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities was million in compared to million in net income from unconsolidated entities owning hotels increased in principally related to improvements in revpar 

table of contents minority interest decreased by million compared to  principally resulting from reduction in losses attributed to minority interest holders from improved operations 
discontinued operations provided net income of million in compared to a loss of million in included in discontinued operations at december   are the operating income or loss  direct interest costs and gains on sale related to the hotels sold in  hotels disposed in and the hotels considered held for sale at december  gains on sale aggregating million were included in the income from discontinued operations 
impairment charges recorded under the provisions of sfas aggregating million are included in the loss from discontinued operations in comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a loss applicable to common stockholders of million  compared to a loss of million in we had a loss from continuing operations of million in compared to a loss of million 
contributing to loss from continuing operations were million of charges related to the early retirement of debt and million in losses from hurricanes 
total revenue from continuing operations increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue is principally attributed to a increase in revpar compared to the increase in revpar came from increases in both adr and occupancy and represents increases in all of our top markets 
the lodging industry nationwide continued to experience increased demand in  but there were only limited increases in room supply leading to strong improvements in revpar in most markets 
in  of our increased revpar was attributed to increases in adr 
increased adr typically improves hotel ebitda margin because the hotels are receiving more revenue for each guest 
for  our hotel ebitda margin improved basis points over total operating expenses increased by million but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
hotel departmental expenses  which consist of rooms expense  food and beverage expense  and other operating departments  increased million compared to  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
these costs are directly related to the number of hotel guests and should improve as a percentage of total revenue as rates increase 
other property operating costs  which consist of general and administrative costs  marketing costs  repairs and maintenance  utilities expense  and other costs  increased million compared to  and remained constant as a percentage of total revenue at 
the only component of these costs that increased as a percentage of total revenue was utility expenses  while the other costs remained constant or decreased as a percent of total revenue 
management and franchise fees increased million compared to and remained essentially the same as a percentage of total revenue 
taxes  insurance and lease expense increased million and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
the increase as a percentage of total revenue was from property tax expense  percentage lease expense and general liability insurance 
property tax expenses increased in largely because of credits for prior year tax appeals that were recorded in percentage lease expense is computed as a percentage of hotel revenues in excess of a base rent 
therefore  as revenues increase  percentage rent expense increases at a faster rate 
general liability insurance reflects the nationwide trend of increases in rates 
corporate expenses increased by million compared to and remained essentially flat as a percentage of total revenue 
depreciation expense increased by million compared to the increase in depreciation expense reflects the large capital expenditures spent in and 
table of contents net interest expense decreased by million in compared to the principal reason for the reduction in interest expense is attributed to reduction in average debt outstanding during our average outstanding debt decreased by million in compared to during we retired million of senior notes and issued million of senior notes and mortgage debt 
in  we further reduced our outstanding debt by million 
in  we incurred hurricane losses of million compared to hurricane losses of million incurred in the hurricane losses for both years represent our insurance deductibles and our best estimates of direct expenses related to these losses during  we incurred net charges of million related to the early retirement of debt of which million was recorded in discontinued operations compared to million in the early extinguishment of debt charges in related principally to secured debt that was retired on hotels that we have designated as non strategic 
the early retirement related principally to the early retirement of senior notes paying interest 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities was million in compared to million in included in was an million gain related to the sale of a residential condominium development in myrtle beach  south carolina 
net income from unconsolidated ventures owning hotels increased in principally related to improvements in revpar 
discontinued operations provided net loss of million in compared to a loss of million in included in discontinued operations are the results of operations of the hotels disposed in in  we recorded impairment charges  under the provisions of sfas  of million  all of which has been included in discontinued operations 
the charges primarily related to our decision to designate as non strategic and sell an additional hotels  in connection with the negotiation of the amendment to our ihg management agreements 
we also recorded impairment charges with respect to hotels previously designated as non strategic principally because of revised estimates of fair value 
preferred dividends increased by million in compared to the principal reasons for this increase are attributed to the issuance of million of series a preferred stock in and the first full year of dividends in in accordance with the emerging issues task force topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock  we have subtracted million of the issuance costs of our redeemed series b preferred stock from net income to determine net loss applicable to common stockholders for the calculation of net loss per share 
non gaap financial measures we refer in this annual report on form k to certain non gaap financial measures

table of contents reconciliation of ratio of operating income to total revenues to hotel ebitda margin year ended december  ratio of operating income to total revenues retail space rental and other revenue unconsolidated taxes  insurance and lease expense consolidated lease expense corporate expenses depreciation hotel ebitda margin substantially all of our non current assets consist of real estate 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance  which are not measures of operating performance under gaap  to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
these supplemental measures  including ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are not measures of operating performance under gaap 
however  we consider these non gaap measures to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income as a measure of our operating performance 
ffo and ebitda the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit 
this may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition  or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
we define ebitda as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap plus interest expenses  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ebitda on the same basis 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are commonly used measures of performance in the hotel industry and give investors a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our individual hotels and operating managers have direct control 
we believe that hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin is useful to investors by providing greater transparency with respect to two significant measures used by us in our financial and operational decision making 
additionally  using these measures facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
we present hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin by eliminating corporate level expenses  depreciation and expenses related to our capital structure 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management in running our business on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  we do not believe that these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  and implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  accurately reflect an adjustment in the value of our 
table of contents assets 
to enhance the comparability of our hotel level operating results with other hotel reits and hotel owners  we are now disclosing hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin rather than the hotel operating profit and hotel operating margin previously disclosed 
the purpose of the change is to remove any distortion created by unconsolidated entities and to reflect hotel level operations as if they were fully consolidated 
to reflect this  we eliminate consolidated percentage rent paid to unconsolidated entities  which is effectively eliminated by minority interest expense and equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries  and include the cost of unconsolidated taxes  insurance and lease expense  to reflect the entire operating costs applicable to our hotels 
use and limitations of non gaap measures our management and board of directors use ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we use hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin in evaluating hotel level performance and the operating efficiency of our hotel managers 
the use of these non gaap financial measures has certain limitations 
ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  as presented by us  may not be comparable to ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin as calculated by other real estate companies 
these measures do not reflect certain expenses that we incurred and will incur  such as depreciation  interest and capital expenditures 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures  and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit  cash flow from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
neither should ffo  ffo per share or ebitda be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions or service our debt 
ffo per share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders 
ffo  ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to stockholders and repayments of indebtedness  has historically been hotel operations 
in  net cash flow provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of hotel operations  was million 
however  in we sold non strategic hotels generating net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from the hotel sales were used to repay debt and pay for capital renovations at our remaining core hotels 
at december   we had cash on hand of million  including approximately million held under management agreements to meet minimum working capital requirements 
for  we declared and paid common dividends aggregating per share 
our board of directors will determine the amount of future common and preferred dividends for each quarter  based upon the actual operating results for that quarter  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as the minimum reit distribution requirements 

table of contents we have committed to spend approximately million over a three year period  commencing in  to renovate our core hotels 
we have used  to date  and expect to use proceeds from non strategic hotel sales to fund these renovations and pay down debt 
the sale of hotels in  generated net proceeds of million  and our remaining non strategic hotels are expected to provide gross proceeds of approximately to million in through february   we sold two of the non strategic hotels for gross proceeds of million  and had three additional hotels under hard contract for sale 
in  we experienced significant displacement from hotel renovation that reduced revenues and hotel ebitda margins 
we expect that the effect of ongoing renovation displacement for will be even more significant 
in  we started construction on the unit royale palms condominium development in myrtle beach  south carolina 
this project is more than pre sold and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of we currently expect to earn net income of approximately million at the completion of the project 
we expect the sale of these condominiums will create an effective bridge for our earnings in a year when renovation displacement will negatively impact our results 
we currently expect that our cash flow provided by operating activities for will be approximately to million 
this cash flow forecast assumes that revpar increases by between and and hotel ebitda margin increases of approximately basis points 
our current operating plan contemplates that we will make aggregate common dividend payments of approximately million  preferred dividend payments of million and million in normal recurring principal payments  leaving surplus cash flow before capital expenditures  additional debt reduction  sale of hotels or sale of royale palms condominiums of approximately to million 
in  we plan to spend approximately million for capital expenditures  which will be funded with proceeds from the sale of non strategic hotels and from cash 
during the first quarter of  our hotels in new orleans and surrounding markets  such as atlanta  baton rouge  houston  san antonio  and dallas  benefited from the increase in demand for hotel rooms  resulting from the displacement of new orleans residents and the influx of relief and construction workers following hurricane katrina 
in the second quarter of  the initial relief work was completed in new orleans  and there was an exodus of first responders from the area 
the shift away from relief workers and temporary housing to ongoing construction workers has dramatically reduced the demand in new orleans  however  the surrounding markets continued to benefit from a strong demand for convention and group business that was moved from new orleans  through the second quarter 
in the third quarter of  we began to see the temporary hurricane demand from surrounding markets subside  and in the fourth quarter of  substantially no temporary hurricane demand remained 
we expect to continue to have relatively weak performance from new orleans in and until convention and tourism return to pre hurricane levels 
events  including terrorist attacks  natural disasters  us military involvement in the middle east and the bankruptcy of several major corporations  had an adverse impact on the capital markets in prior years 
events  or circumstances of similar magnitude or impact  could adversely affect the availability and cost of our capital 
in addition  any slowdown of the overall economy and of the lodging industry could adversely affect our operating cash flow and the availability and cost of capital for our business 
we are subject to increases in hotel operating expenses  including wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  utilities and insurance expenses  that can fluctuate disproportionately to revenues 
operating expenses are difficult to predict and control  which can produce volatility in our operating results 
our hotel ebitda margins from continuing operations increased in and however  if our hotel revpar decreases and or hotel ebitda margins shrink  our operations  earnings and or cash flow could suffer a material adverse effect 
debt during  we paid down debt of approximately million  refinanced another million of debt and reduced interest rates by on million of senior debt 
the combined effect of these actions will result in reducing our annual interest expense by million and lowering our weighted average cost of debt by basis points 

table of contents line of credit our million line of credit contains certain restrictive covenants  including a leverage ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  unencumbered leverage ratio and a maximum payout ratio 
the interest on our line can range from to basis points over libor  based on our leverage ratio as defined in our line of credit agreement 
in addition to financial covenants  our line of credit includes certain other affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on our ability to create or acquire wholly owned subsidiaries  restrictions on the operation ownership of our hotels  limitations on our ability to lease property or guarantee leases of other persons  limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as distributions on common and preferred stock  share repurchases and certain investments  limitations on our ability to merge or consolidate with other persons  to issue stock of our subsidiaries and to sell all or substantially all of our assets  restrictions on our ability to make investments in condominium developments  limitations on our ability to change the nature of our business  limitations on our ability to modify certain instruments  to create liens  to enter into transactions with affiliates  and limitations on our ability to enter into joint ventures 
at the date of this filing  we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
if operating results fall significantly below our current expectations  we may not be able to meet some or all of these covenants in which case we may be unable to borrow under our line of credit 
the breach of any of the covenants and limitations under our line of credit could result in the acceleration of amounts outstanding 
our failure to satisfy any accelerated recourse indebtedness  if in the amount of million or more  could result in the acceleration of our other unsecured recourse indebtedness 
we may not be able to refinance or repay our debt in full under those circumstances 
our other borrowings contain affirmative and negative covenants that are generally equal to or less restrictive than our line of credit 
payment of amounts due under our line of credit is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries who also guarantee payment of our senior debt and payment is secured by a pledge of our limited partnership interest in felcor lp 
at december  we had no borrowings under our line of credit 
our interest rate on our line of credit has decreased from libor plus to libor plus during based on our leverage ratio as defined in our line of credit agreement 
construction loan in  we started construction on the unit royale palms condominium development in myrtle beach  south carolina 
this project is more than pre sold and is expected to be completed with the condominiums substantially all closed in the second quarter of in conjunction with this development  we entered into a million recourse construction loan facility 
through december   we had spent million on this project and had drawn million on the construction loan 
on july   the interest on this construction loan was reduced from libor plus to libor plus under the terms of the original loan agreement 
mortgage debt at december   we had aggregate mortgage indebtedness  excluding our construction loan  of approximately million that was secured by of our consolidated hotels with an aggregate book value of approximately billion 
our hotel mortgage debt is recourse solely to the specific assets securing the debt  except in the case of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse carve out provisions 
loans secured by two hotels provide for lock box arrangements under certain circumstances 
with respect to these loans  we are permitted to retain of budgeted hotel operating expenses  but the remaining revenues would become subject to a lock box arrangement if a specified debt service coverage ratio is not met 
these hotels currently exceed the minimum debt service coverage ratio  however  under the terms of the loan agreement  the lock box provisions remain in place until the loan is repaid 
none of these hotels have ever fallen below the debt service coverage ratio 
our hotel mortgage debt is non recourse to us and contains provisions allowing for the substitution of collateral upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
most of our mortgage debt is prepayable  subject to various prepayment  yield maintenance or defeasance obligations 

table of contents senior notes as a result of the strong economy  its impact on the travel and lodging industries  and our lower secured debt levels  standard poor s raised its ratings on our senior debt twice in  from b to b in january and then to b in october and moody s investor service raised its ratings from b to ba as a result of the moody s upgrade  effective april   the interest rate applicable to million of our senior debt maturing in decreased from to  reducing annualized interest expense by million 
if the credit rating on our senior debt is downgraded by moody s to b and standard poor s rating remains below bb  the interest rate on this debt will again increase to 
our publicly traded senior notes require that we satisfy total leverage  secured leverage and interest coverage tests in order to incur additional indebtedness except to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt  as defined under our indentures  pay dividends in excess of the minimum dividend required to meet the reit qualification test  repurchase capital stock  or merge 
as of the date of this filing  we have satisfied all such tests 
under the terms of certain of our indentures  we are prohibited from repurchasing any of our capital stock  whether common or preferred  subject to certain exceptions  so long as our debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the indentures  exceeds to debt  as defined in the indentures  approximates our consolidated debt 
ebitda is defined in the indentures as consolidated gaap net income  adjusted for minority interest in felcor lp  actual cash distributions by unconsolidated entities  gains or losses from asset sales  dividends on preferred stock and extraordinary gains and losses as defined at the date of the indentures  plus interest expense  income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense and other non cash items 
although our current debt to editda ratio is below to  a decline in our ebitda  as a result of asset sales  adverse economic developments or an increase in our debt  could make us subject to this limitation 
in addition  if we were unable to continue to satisfy the incurrence test under the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes  we may be prohibited from  among other things  incurring any additional indebtedness  except under certain specific exceptions  or paying dividends on our preferred or common stock  except to the extent necessary to satisfy the reit qualification requirement that we distribute currently at least of our taxable income 
we currently anticipate that we will meet our financial covenant and incurrence tests based on current revpar expectations 
for  we currently anticipate that our full year portfolio revpar will be approximately to above the prior year

the interest on this facility is being capitalized as part of the cost of the project

interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that own an aggregate of hotels referred to as hotel joint ventures  and we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that operate four of those hotels referred to as operating joint ventures 
we own of the lessees operating two hotels owned by the hotel joint ventures  approximately of the lessees operating hotels owned by the hotel joint ventures and one hotel joint venture is operated without a lease 
we also owned a interest in entities that provide condominium management services and develop condominiums in myrtle beach  south carolina 
none of our directors  officers or employees owns any interest in any of these joint ventures or entities 
the hotel joint ventures had million of non recourse mortgage debt relating to the hotel  of which our prorata portion was million 
this debt is not reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our liabilities with regard to non recourse debt and the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are members or partners in joint ventures are generally limited to the guarantee of the borrowing entity s obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the venture and other typical exceptions from the non recourse provisions in the mortgages  such as for environmental liabilities 
we have recorded equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities of million  million  and million including a gain of million related to the development and sale of condominiums for the years ended december   and  respectively  and received distributions of million of which million was provided from operations  of million of which million was provided from operations  and million of which million was provided by operations for the years  and  respectively 
the principal source of income for our hotel joint ventures is percentage lease revenue from the operating lessees 
we own of the operating lessees for of the hotel joint ventures 
capital expenditures on the hotels owned by our hotel joint ventures are generally paid from their capital reserve account  which is funded from the income from operations of these ventures 
however  if a venture has insufficient cash flow to meet operating expenses or make necessary capital improvements  the venture may make a capital call upon the venture members or partners to fund such necessary improvements 
it is possible that  in the event of a capital call  the other joint venture member or partner may be unwilling or unable to make the necessary capital contributions 
under such circumstances  we may elect to make the other party s contribution as a loan to the venture or as an additional capital contribution by us 
under certain circumstances  a capital contribution by us may increase our equity investment to greater than and may require that we consolidate the venture  including all of its assets and liabilities  into our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to those ventures that are partnerships  the hotels owned by these ventures could perform below expectations and result in the insolvency of the ventures and the acceleration of their debts  unless the members or partners provide additional capital 
in some ventures  the members or partners may be required to make additional capital contributions or have their interest in the venture be reduced or offset for the benefit of any party making the required investment on their behalf 
we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in a venture or investing additional capital under circumstances that do not assure a return on that investment 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future 
we are also subject to the risk that inflation will cause increases in hotel operating expenses disproportionately to revenues 

table of contents seasonality the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may utilize cash on hand or borrowings to satisfy our obligations or make distributions to our equity holders 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  the carrying value of investments in hotels  litigation  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in one or more of our hotels held for investment has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis  or net book value  of the investment 
we test for impairment when certain events occur  including one or more of the following projected cash flows are significantly less than recent historical cash flows  significant changes in legal factors or actions by a regulator that could affect the value of our hotels  events that could cause changes or uncertainty in travel patterns  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a hotel will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
over the past three years we identified non strategic hotels that we expected to sell significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life 
the shorter probable holding periods related to our decision to sell these hotels was the primary factor that led to impairment charges on these hotels 
as these hotels are sold  we may recognize additional losses or gains on sale 
in the evaluation of impairment of our hotels  and in establishing impairment charges  we made many assumptions and estimates on a hotel by hotel basis  which included the following o annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  o holding periods  o expected remaining useful lives of assets  o estimates in fair values taking into consideration future cash flows  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices  and o future capital expenditures 
changes in these estimates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying hotels could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the hotels that may not be reflected in the hotel s carrying value  thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 
at december   all hotels on which we have recorded impairment charges have been sold or are classified as held for sale at that date 

table of contents at december   we had hotels that were classified as held for sale and were carried at the lower of historical net book value or fair value less costs to sell 
we made estimates of fair values of these hotels based on pending contracts  offers received  cash flows  capitalization rates and comparable selling prices 
we also made estimates of selling costs based on commission rates and other selling costs expected to be incurred 
we make estimates with respect to contingent liabilities for losses covered by insurance in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting for contingencies 
we record liabilities for self insured losses under our insurance programs when it becomes probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we are self insured for the first  per occurrence  of our general liability claims with regard to of our hotels 
we review the adequacy of our reserves for our self insured claims on a regular basis 
our reserves are intended to cover the estimated ultimate uninsured liability for losses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred at the end of each accounting period 
these reserves represent estimates at a given date  generally utilizing projections based on claims  historical settlement of claims and estimates of future costs to settle claims 
estimates are also required since there may be delays in reporting 
because establishment of insurance reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if our insurance reserves of million  at december   for general liability losses are insufficient  we will record an additional expense in future periods 
property and catastrophic losses are event driven losses and  as such  until a loss occurs and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
we had recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to property or catastrophic losses at december  our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  have cumulative potential future tax deductions totaling million 
the net deferred income tax asset associated with these potential future tax deductions was million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to of our million deferred tax asset related to our trss  because of the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
in accordance with sfas  we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase operating income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting announcements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
the company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
once it is determined that a position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation clearly scopes out income tax positions related to fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we will adopt the provisions of this statement beginning in the first quarter of we do not expect the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin  if any  to be material 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
this statement clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy  giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data 
sfas no 
applies whenever other standards require assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
this statement is effective in fiscal years beginning after november  we believe that the adoption of this standard on january  will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
