item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying 
table of contents value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of the customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as noted in note g to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  the company has accrued  in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  are expected to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note g 
however  as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and necessary remediation of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
changes in information known to management or in applicable regulations may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
as noted in notes b and s to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  the company recorded asset impairment charges under sfas in including a  charge in as part of the loss recognized for discontinued operations 
based on assessments performed in on the continuing assets of the company  which indicated no write downs were deemed necessary  the company believes that it is unlikely that these types of impairment charges will continue to occur with respect to its existing assets 
however  if business conditions at any of the plant sites were to deteriorate to an extent where cash flows and other impairment measurements indicated values for the related long lived assets were less than the carrying values of those assets  additional impairment charges could be necessary 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows used in operations during totaled  this compares to cash flows provided by operations during of  of which  was provided by continuing operations and  was provided by discontinued operations 
as a result  cash flows from continuing operations decreased  from the amount 
after declining  in  the company s inventories increased  from year end to year end 
almost all of the increase was in the metals segment primarily as a result of the significant increase in cost from stainless steel surcharges discussed below coupled with the need to maintain higher inventory levels to accommodate the higher demand for its products and the desire to keep large inventories in a rising price environment 
the inventory on hand at year end is carried on the books at costs substantially lower than current prices 
the inventory decline in was primarily the result of the metals segment completing a planned reduction of inventory units which resulted in the net reduction in inventory dollars at year end 
accounts receivable increased  in compared to increasing  in the increases resulted primarily from the significant improvement in sales experienced in both  up percent  and  up percent  over prior year amounts  as both operating segments responded to rising raw material and operating costs with higher selling prices  coupled with selling more unit volumes 
accounts payable increased  in compared to an increase of  in both increases resulted primarily from increases in the costs of raw materials discussed above combined with the timing of the receipt of and payment for stainless steel raw materials by the metals segment in compared to the year to year reduction in cash flows also resulted from the receipt of  at the end of from the anti dumping settlement  of which  was paid out in january  discussed in the results of operations below 
also contributing to the year to year reduction in cash flows was  of cash flows provided by discontinued operations in which were derived from declines in accounts receivable and inventories offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
the cash flows were generated from the liquidation of net assets related to the sale of the company s dye business at the end of as discussed in the discontinued operations discussion below 
cash flows were positively impacted in by net income from continuing operations of  before depreciation and amortization expense of  compared to  
table of contents generated in the net effect of the items described above was to increase current assets by  which also caused working capital for to increase by  to  from the amount in the current ratio for the year ended december   also increased to from the year end ratio of the company utilized its line of credit facility to fund its working capital needs and fund capital expenditures of  as borrowings increased  in the company expects that cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to make debt payments  fund estimated capital expenditures of  and normal operating requirements  and pay a dividend of 
per share on march  for a cash payment of  on december   the company entered into a credit agreement with a lender to provide a  line of credit that expires on december   and refinanced the company s existing bank indebtedness 
the agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of  which includes a  sub limit for swing line loans that requires additional pre approval by the bank  and a five year  term loan requiring equal quarterly payments of  with a balloon payment at the expiration date 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited to an amount equal to a borrowing base calculation that includes eligible accounts receivable  inventories  and cash surrender value of the company s life insurance as defined in the agreement 
as of december   the amount available for borrowing was  of which  was borrowed  leaving  of availability 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants which include  among others  maintaining certain ebitda  fixed charge and tangible net worth ratios and amounts 
as a result of normal operations and planned reductions of inventories in the first quarter of  the company reduced its long term debt by approximately percent from the year end balance

consolidated selling  general and administrative expense for increased  to  compared to  but declined as a percent of sales to eight percent in compared to nine percent in the dollar increase came primarily from a combination of profit incentives paid in the metals segment  increased general insurance expense  and an increase in unallocated corporate expenses and the recording of environmental charges discussed in comparison of corporate expenses below 
consolidated operating results for were significantly impacted by the transactions recorded during the fourth quarter of discussed above under comparison of to metals segment the following table summarizes operating results and backlogs for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note p to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
amount in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating income year end backlogs piping systems comparison of to metals segment the metals segment produced strong sales growth of percent for the year and percent for the fourth quarter of compared to the same periods a year earlier 
the increase for the year resulted from a combination of percent higher unit volumes and a two percent increase in average selling prices 
the increase 
table of contents for the quarter resulted from a percent increase in average selling prices partially offset by a two percent decline in unit volumes 
the segment achieved a surge in gross profits of percent for and percent in the fourth quarter compared to the same periods last year 
the increase in unit volumes for the year resulted partly from an increase in commodity pipe sales resulting from recapturing market share beginning in the last quarter of however  the largest portion of the increase was from much higher production of piping systems for energy and water treatment customers 
the slight decline in fourth quarter unit volumes as compared with fourth quarter resulted from an unusually high level of commodity pipe sales in the fourth quarter of that resulted from the aggressive program to recapture market share mentioned above 
the modest increase in selling prices for the year resulted from a more robust increase in prices mostly offset by the change in product mix 
the significant increase in fourth quarter selling prices reflects the higher costs of stainless steel  including surcharges  in the fourth quarter of compared to s fourth quarter  coupled with a change in product mix 
surcharges are assessed each month by the stainless steel producers to cover the change in their costs of certain raw materials 
the company  in turn  passes on the surcharge in the sales prices charged to its customers 
under the company s first in first out inventory method  cost of goods sold is charged for the surcharges that were in effect three or more months prior to the month of sale 
accordingly  if surcharges are in an upward trend  reported profits will benefit 
conversely  when surcharges go down  profits are reduced 
during the third and fourth quarters of  surcharges were significantly higher than they were in the first six months with an accompanying significant benefit to profits 
the fourth quarter of also benefited from surcharges  but to a much lesser extent than the significant increase in gross profits for resulted from a much improved operating level in piping systems plus the good unit volume increase in pipe sales  partially offset by a lower surcharge benefit 
the significant increase in gross profit for the fourth quarter came from the increase in selling prices and the significant benefit from rising surcharges 
the improvement in sales and operating income reflects management s successful efforts to penetrate new markets for piping systems as well as pipe sales 
the energy industry  including lng and ethanol projects  together with waste water treatment provided a small percentage of the segment s sales prior to although the segment has benefited from regaining market share in commodity pipe  these new sources generated much of the improvement in results 
with these new industry segments comprising about percent of the piping systems backlog  management believes that it has differentiated the segment from its domestic competitors by having unique manufacturing capabilities that give the segment a competitive advantage in pursuing non commodity pipe sales as well as piping systems projects 
selling and administrative expense increased only  or 
percent in when compared to  and as a result declined to four percent of sales in compared to five percent of sales in as a result of all of the factors listed above  the segment experienced significant sales and profit improvement for the year compared to  with operating income increasing percent for the year and percent in the fourth quarter of compared to the same periods last year 
comparison of to metals segment the metals segment accomplished noteworthy sales growth of percent for the year and percent for the fourth quarter of compared to a year earlier 
the increases resulted from a combination of percent and three percent higher average selling prices and one percent and percent higher unit volumes for the year and fourth quarter  respectively 
gross profit for the segment improved  or percent  and remained basically unchanged as a percent of sales at percent for compared to percent in in the fourth quarter of compared to  gross profit increased  or nine percent  but decreased percent of sales to percent from the fourth quarter of during the first six months of  surcharges paid on stainless steel raw materials increased steadily and the segment was able to increase selling prices to pass on the increased costs 
because of the steadily increasing raw material costs and selling prices experienced throughout and the first half of  the segment generated higher profits from selling lower cost inventories 
however  because raw material costs and selling prices stabilized in the second half of  the profits realized from this source in the third and fourth quarters of were substantially less than profits realized in as well as the first two quarters of the significant increase in unit volume experienced in the fourth quarter came primarily from commodity pipe sales as management focused on improving its market share of commodity pipe 
this change in product mix to a higher level of commodity pipe also contributed to the lower margins experienced in the fourth quarter of sales of higher margin specialty alloy pipe improved steadily throughout as unit volumes increased over the same quarter of the prior year for six consecutive quarters starting in the third quarter of in addition  piping systems benefited from its strong backlog as sales and profitability increased each quarter in compared to the preceding quarter 

table of contents selling and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to  but declined to five percent of sales in compared to seven percent of sales in the increase in dollars came primarily from increases in profit based incentives  sales commissions from increased sales  and an increase in general insurance expense 
as a result of all of the factors listed above  the segment experienced significant sales and profit improvement for compared to  as the segment achieved a percent increase in operating income for and a seven percent increase in the fourth quarter compared to the same periods in specialty chemicals segment the following tables summarize operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note p to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
amount in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administrative expense operating income comparison of to specialty chemicals segment the specialty chemicals segment sales increased nine percent for the year ended and gross profit increased a more dramatic percent to  compared to  for  and increased to percent of sales for the year compared to percent a year ago 
a modest sales decline of three percent in the fourth quarter of was overshadowed by a percent increase in gross profits to  for the quarter compared to  for the same period of the increase in revenues for the year resulted primarily from adding several new products during the first three quarters of  a significant increase in demand for one of our contract manufacturing products  and increased selling prices to pass on higher energy related costs 
the minor decline in fourth quarter revenues resulted from the normal fluctuation in demand from quarter to quarter 
the segment completed the relocation of its pigment operations from greensboro  nc to spartanburg  sc at the end of the first quarter of and benefited from the improved efficiency resulting from the consolidation of the two operations throughout the rest of the year 
the combination of the cost savings from the relocation and increase in revenues produced the profit improvement for the year 
the significant improvement in profit experienced in the fourth quarter resulted from the cost savings in and the impact on the fourth quarter of earnings at the spartanburg plant related to costs of developing new products and upgrading of the staff in expectation of higher production levels in selling and administrative expense increased  or four percent in compared to  but declined as a percent of sales to eight percent in compared to nine percent in the dollar increase resulted primarily from profit based incentives 
as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income increased percent to  compared to  for in the fourth quarter of operating income increased percent to  for the quarter compared to  for the same period of comparison of to specialty chemicals segment the specialty chemicals segment produced strong sales growth of percent and percent for the year and fourth quarter of  respectively 
gross profit for the segment improved  or two percent  but decreased as a percent of sales two percent to percent from s percentage 
in the fourth quarter of compared to  gross profit increased  or percent  and decreased as a percent of sales one percent to percent from the fourth quarter of the segment experienced favorable business conditions throughout as demand for its products remained strong 
the profit improvement for the year did not keep pace with the sales growth because of increased raw material and operating costs resulting primarily from the increase in crude oil prices negatively impacting oil based raw material costs and utility and transportation costs 
although the segment implemented selling price increases throughout the year  it was unable to increase prices consistent with the increases in manufacturing costs  which caused an erosion of gross profits 
also impacting profitability was the effect of changes in product mix and expenses  including contract tolling  at the spartanburg 
table of contents plant related to new products and upgrading of the staff in expectation of higher production levels in the spartanburg location lost a high margin tolling contract in that also reduced profitability at the plant 
although the segment was able to add several new contracts in spartanburg during the fourth quarter of  they were not placed in production long enough to offset the lost profits 
selling and administrative expense remained relatively flat in compared to  and declined as a percent of sales to nine percent in compared to ten percent in resulting from management s efforts to maintain an even level of sales and administrative expense to offset the higher manufacturing costs the segment was experiencing 
management was pleased with the overall performance of the segment  considering the negative impact of steadily rising raw material and operating costs experienced throughout  as operating income increased slightly to  and  for the year and fourth quarter of  respectively  compared to  and  for the same periods of for information related to environmental matters  see note g to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
discontinued operations on march   the company entered into an agreement to sell its liquid dye business composed of vat  sulfur  liquid disperse and liquid reactive dyes  which had annual sales of approximately  for approximately its net book value  and several customers and related products of the remaining textile dye business were rationalized 
business conditions in the remaining dye business were poor throughout  especially in the first six months  as bu colors a newly formed subsidiary of the company called blackman uhler  llc experienced operating losses in every quarter of in the third quarter of  the company decided to attempt to sell the remaining dye business and on december   entered into a purchase agreement to sell the dye business 
the transaction closed on january  the terms included the sale of the inventory of bu colors along with certain equipment and other property associated with the business being sold  and the licensing of certain intellectual property  for a purchase price of approximately  of which  was paid at closing  and the balance of  was to be paid over time based on the operations of the purchaser 
on january   the company and the purchaser amended the purchase agreement replacing the periodic purchase price payments with a one time payment of  which was received on january   and was reclassified to a current note receivable in the financial statements at december  as a result of the sale of the dye business in  the company has discontinued the operations of bu colors and has presented the financial information of bu colors as discontinued operations 
in december of  the company completed an impairment assessment in accordance with fas no

current conditions and outlook management remains confident in the potential success of its fire retardant products in because of the successful results from required testing and plant production trials at several significant potential customers  our sleep safe line is gaining recognition as a low cost solution to the federal regulations that go into effect on july  this source of anticipated new business together with management s expectation of continued growth in other products  and based on current conditions in the general economy  lead us to believe that should produce a continuation of improved results from the specialty chemicals segment 
piping systems backlog increased steadily throughout ending the year at  which is about  higher than a year earlier 
management expects about percent of the backlog to be completed over the next months which should provide an improved level of sales and profits for piping systems in our optimism about the future is also based on the large dollar amount of projects we expect to bid during assuming no significant decline in demand and a continuation of the surcharges currently in effect  pipe sales and profits should produce results comparable to which  combined with anticipated efficiencies from higher pipe production for our piping systems  should enhance profitability compared to item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in interest rates 
in this regard  changes in u 
s 
interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents as well as interest paid on its indebtedness 
except as described below  the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
fair value of the company s debt obligations  which approximated the recorded value  consisted of 
table of contents at december   under a  line of credit and term loan agreement expiring december  with a variable interest rate of percent 
at december   under a  line of credit and term loan agreement expiring december  with a variable interest rate of percent 
the company periodically utilizes derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related pronouncements 
cash flow and fair value hedges are hedges that are intended to eliminate the risk of changes in the fair values of assets  liabilities and certain types of firm commitments 
the company s objective in using these instruments is to help protect its earnings and cash flows from interest rate risks on its long term indebtedness and fluctuations in the fair value of commodities used in the company s stainless steel raw materials 
the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions 
in this documentation  the company specifically identifies the asset  liability and non cancelable commitment that has been designated as a hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to that item 
the company formally measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis 
the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires  when it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur  when a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or when management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
cash flow hedges are hedges that use simple derivatives to offset the variability of expected future cash flows 
variability can appear in floating rate liabilities and can arise from changes in interest rates 
the company uses an interest rate swap in which it pays a fixed rate of interest while receiving a variable rate of interest to change the cash flow profile of its variable rate borrowing to match a fixed rate profile 
as discussed in note e to the consolidated financial statements  the company entered into a long term debt agreement with its bank and pays interest based on a variable interest rate 
to mitigate the variability of the interest rate risk  the company entered into a derivative swap contract in february of with the bank  coupled with a third party who will pay a variable rate of interest an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is for  with a fixed interest rate of percent  and runs from march  to december   which equates to the final payment amount and due date of the term loan 
although the swap is expected to effectively offset variable interest in the borrowing hedge  accounting is not utilized 
therefore  changes in its fair value are being recorded in current assets or liabilities  as appropriate  with corresponding offsetting entries to interest expense 
in the ordinary course of business  the company s income and cash flows may be affected by fluctuations in the price of nickel  which is a component of stainless steel raw materials used in its production of stainless steel pipe 
the company is subject to raw material surcharges on the nickel component from its stainless steel suppliers 
for certain non cancelable fixed price sales contracts having delivery dates in the future  the company is not able to obtain fixed price purchase commitments to cover the nickel surcharge component of the stainless steel raw material requirements of the sales contract which creates a cost exposure from fluctuations in the nickel surcharges 
where such exposure exists  the company considers the use of cash settled commodity price swaps with durations approximately equal to the expected delivery dates of the applicable raw materials to hedge the price of its nickel requirements 
the company designates these instruments as fair value hedges and the resulting changes in their fair value are recorded as inventory costs 
subsequent gains and losses are recognized into cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
while these hedging activities may protect the company against higher nickel prices  they may also prevent realizing possible lower raw material costs in the event that the market price of nickel falls below the price stated in a forward sale or futures contract 
there were no outstanding hedging contracts on nickel commodities at december
