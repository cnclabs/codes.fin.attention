item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on may  our investment objectives are to achieve a high level of current income by investing in debt securities  consisting primarily of senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  of established private businesses that are substantially owned by leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds or are family owned businesses  with a particular focus on senior subordinated notes 
in addition  we may acquire existing loans that meet this profile from leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds and others 
we also seek to provide our stockholders with long term capital growth through the appreciation in the value of warrants or other equity instruments that we may receive when we make loans 
we operate as a closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a business development company under the investment company act of the act 
we seek out small and medium sized businesses that meet certain criteria  including some but not all of the following the potential for growth in cash flow  adequate assets for loan collateral  experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower  profitable operations based on the borrower s cash flow  reasonable capitalization of the borrower usually by leveraged buyout funds or venture capital funds and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position  if any 
we anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the borrower  a public offering of the borrower s stock or by exercising our right to require the borrower to repurchase our warrants  though there can be no assurance that we will always have these rights 
we lend to borrowers that need funds to finance growth  restructure their balance sheets or effect a change of control 
our loans typically range from million to million  although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes  generally mature in no more than seven years and accrue interest at fixed or variable rates 
some of our loans may contain a provision that calls for some portion of the interest payments to be deferred and added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind pik interest  and  when earned  we record pik interest as interest income and add the pik interest to the principal balance of the loans 
we seek to avoid pik interest with all potential investments under review 
we currently do not hold any investments with pik income 
because the majority of our portfolio loans consist of term debt of private companies who typically cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency  we expect that most  if not all  of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated 
we cannot accurately predict what ratings these loans might receive if they were rated  and thus cannot determine whether or not they could be considered investment grade quality 
to the extent possible  our loans generally are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets 
interest payments are generally made monthly or quarterly except to the extent of any pik interest with amortization of principal generally being deferred for several years 
the principal amount of the loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at maturity at five to seven years 
when we receive a warrant to purchase stock in a borrower in connection with a loan  the warrant will typically have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the portfolio company s common stock at the time of the loan and entitle us to purchase a modest percentage of the borrower s stock 
original issue discounts oid arise when we extend a loan and receive an equity interest in the borrower at the same time 
to the extent that the price paid for the equity is not at market value  we must allocate part of the price paid for the loan  to the value of the equity 
then the amount allocated to the equity  the oid  must be amortized over the life of the loan 
as with pik interest  the amortization of oid also produces income that must be recognized for purposes of satisfying the distribution requirements for a regulated investment company ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of the code  whereas the cash is received  if at all  when the equity instrument is sold 
we seek to avoid oid with all potential investments under review and to date do not hold any investments with oid income 
in addition  as a business development company under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
our investment adviser  gladstone management corporation the adviser provides these services on our behalf through its officers who are also our officers 
currently  neither we nor our adviser charges a fee for managerial assistance  however  if our adviser does receive fees for managerial assistance  our adviser will credit the managerial assistance fees to the base management fee due from us to our adviser 
our adviser receives fees for other services it provides to our portfolio companies 
these other fees are typically non recurring  are recognized as revenue when earned and are generally paid directly to our adviser by the borrower or potential borrower upon closing of the investment 
the services our adviser provides to portfolio companies vary by investment  but generally include a broad array of services  such as investment banking services  arranging bank and equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders and investors  reviewing existing credit facilities  restructuring existing investments  raising equity and debt capital  turnaround management  merger and acquisition services and recruiting new management personnel 
when our adviser receives fees for these services  of certain of those fees are credited against the base management fee that we pay to our adviser 
our adviser also receives fees for monitoring and reviewing portfolio company investments 
these fees are recurring and are generally paid annually or quarterly in advance to our adviser throughout the life of the investment 
fees of this nature are recorded as revenue by our adviser when earned and are not credited against the base management fee 
we may receive fees for the origination and closing services we provide to portfolio companies through our adviser 
these fees are paid directly to us and are recognized as revenue upon closing of the originated investment and are reported as fee income in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to making an investment  we ordinarily enter into a non binding term sheet with the potential borrower 
these non binding term sheets are generally subject to a number of conditions  including  but not limited to  the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations of the potential borrower s business  reaching agreement on the legal documentation for the loan  and the receipt of all necessary consents 
upon execution of the non binding term sheet  the potential borrower generally pays the adviser a non refundable fee for services rendered by the adviser through the date of the non binding term sheet 
these fees are received by the adviser and are offset against the base management fee payable to the adviser  which has the effect of reducing our expenses to the extent of any such fees received by the adviser 
in the event that we expend significant effort in considering and negotiating a potential investment that ultimately is not consummated  we generally will seek reimbursement from the proposed borrower for our reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the transaction  including legal fees 
any amounts collected for expenses incurred by the adviser in connection with unconsummated investments will be reimbursed to the adviser 
amounts collected for these expenses incurred by us will be reimbursed to us and will be recognized in the period in which such reimbursement is received  however  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in collecting any such reimbursements 
during the fiscal year ended september   we extended  directly or through participations  approximately million of new loans to a total of companies 
also  during the fiscal year ended september   five borrowers repaid their loans ahead of contractual maturity of an aggregate of approximately million  one borrower refinanced its investment of approximately million and we sold or repaid in full on twenty seven syndicated loans of an aggregate of approximately million  and we received scheduled contractual principal repayments of approximately million  for total principal repayments of approximately million 
since our initial public offering in august  we have made different loans to  or investments in  companies for a total of approximately million  before giving effect to principal repayments on investments and divestitures

we have been externally managed by our adviser since october  our adviser was organized as a corporation under the laws of the state of delaware on july   and is a registered investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  as amended 
our adviser and administrator are headquartered in mclean  virginia  a suburb of washington dc  and our adviser also has offices in the states of new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  illinois  texas and washington 
investment advisory and management agreement on december   our stockholders approved a proposal to enter into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement the amended advisory agreement with our adviser and an administration agreement the administration agreement between us and our administrator  both of which became effective on october  the amended advisory agreement replaced the original advisory agreement the initial advisory agreement  which terminated on september  pursuant to the initial advisory agreement  we paid our adviser an annual advisory fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly computed increments of  and an annual administrative fee of of our total assets as reduced by cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors  payable in quarterly computed increments of  for a total annual base management fee of 
this fee was then directly reduced by the amount of loan servicing fees paid to the adviser and any other fees received by the adviser from our borrowers and potential borrowers 
under the amended advisory agreement  we pay our adviser an annual base management fee of of our average gross assets  which is defined as total assets less cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors calculated as of the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters and also consists of a two part incentive fee 
the first part of the incentive fee is an income based incentive fee which rewards our adviser if our quarterly net investment income before giving effect to any incentive fee exceeds of our net assets the hurdle rate 
we will pay our adviser an income incentive fee with respect to our pre incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate annualized  of our pre incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre incentive fee net investment income  if any  that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than in any calendar quarter annualized  and of the amount of our pre incentive fee net investment income  if any  that exceeds in any calendar quarter annualized 
the second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains incentive fee that will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year or upon termination of the amended advisory agreement  as of the termination date  which commenced on october   and will equal of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year 
in determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to our adviser  we will calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception  and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation  as applicable  with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio 
we did not earn the capital gains portion of the incentive fee for the fiscal year ended september  we will continue to pay our direct expenses including  but not limited to  directors fees  legal and accounting fees  stockholder related expenses  and directors and officers insurance under the amended advisory agreement 
the adviser s board of directors has agreed to voluntarily waive of the annual base management fee to for senior syndicated loans for each quarter during the fiscal year ended september  in addition to the base management and incentive fees under the amended advisory agreement  certain fees received by the adviser from our portfolio companies were credited against the investment advisory fee under the initial advisory agreement  and will continue to be paid to the adviser and credited under the amended advisory agreement 
the adviser services our loan portfolio pursuant to a loan servicing agreement with gladstone business loan  llc business loan in return for a annual fee  based on the monthly aggregate outstanding loan balance of the loans pledged under our credit facility 
effective in april  the adviser s board of directors voted to reduce the portion of the annual fee to for senior syndicated loans 
this fee directly reduces the amount of fee payable under both the initial and amended advisory agreements 
administration agreement under the administration agreement  we pay separately for administrative services 
the administration agreement provides for payments equal to our allocable portion of the administrator s overhead expenses in performing its obligations under the administration agreement including  but not limited to  rent for employees of the administrator  and our allocable portion of the salaries and benefits expenses of our chief financial officer  controller  chief compliance officer  treasurer and their respective staffs 
our allocable portion of expenses is derived by multiplying our administrator s total expenses by the percentage of our average total assets the total assets at the beginning and end of each quarter in comparison to the average total assets of all companies managed by our adviser under similar agreements

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
we have identified our investment valuation process  tax status and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting policies 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
general valuation policy using procedures established by our board of directors  we value our investment portfolio each quarter 
we carry our investments at fair value  as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
securities that are publicly traded  if any  are valued at the closing price of the exchange or securities market on which they are listed on the valuation date 
securities that are not traded on a public exchange or securities market  but for which a limited market exists and that have been rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsro  such as certain participations in syndicated loans are valued at the indicative bid price offered by the syndication agent s desk on or near the valuation date 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded  for which a limited market does not exist  or for which a limited market exists but that have not been rated by a nrsro or for which we have various degrees of trading restrictions are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
in making the good faith determination of the value of these securities  we start with the contractual balance of the security  which includes pik interest  if any 
we then apply the methods set out below in valuation methods 
members of our adviser s portfolio management team prepare the valuations of our investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts 
these individuals also consult with portfolio company senior management and ownership to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development  and other operational issues 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security 
at september   we engaged standard poor s securities evaluations  inc spse to submit opinions of value for our debt securities that are issued to portfolio companies where we have no equity  or equity like securities 
we request that spse also evaluate and assign values to success fees conditional interest included in some debt securities when we determine that the probability of receiving a success fee on a given loan is above  a threshold of significance 
we may also submit pik interest to spse for valuation when it is determined the pik interest is likely to be received 
spse will only evaluate the debt portion of our investments for which we specifically request evaluation  and may decline to make requested evaluations for any reason at its sole discretion 
upon completing our collection of data with respect to the investments including the information described under credit information  the risk ratings of the loans described under loan grading and risk rating and the factors described under valuation methods  this valuation data is forwarded to spse for review and analysis 
spse makes its independent assessment of the data that we have assembled and assesses its independent data to form an opinion as to what they consider to be the market values for the securities 
with regard to its work  spse has issued the following paragraph spse provides evaluated price opinions which are reflective of what spse believes the bid side of the market would be for each loan after careful review and analysis of descriptive  market and credit information 
each price reflects spse s best judgment based upon careful examination of a variety of market factors 
because of fluctuation in the market and in other factors beyond its control  spse cannot guarantee these evaluations 
the evaluations reflect the market prices  or estimates thereof  on the date specified 
the prices are based on comparable market prices for similar securities 
market information has been obtained from reputable secondary market sources 
although these sources are considered reliable  spse cannot guarantee their accuracy 
spse opinions of value of our debt securities where we have no equity or equity like securities are submitted to our board of directors along with our adviser s supplemental assessment and recommendation regarding valuation of each of these investments 
our adviser generally accepts the opinion of value given by spse  however  in certain limited circumstances  such as when our adviser may learn new information regarding an investment between the time of submission to spse and the date of the board assessment  our adviser s conclusions as to value may differ from the opinion of value delivered by spse 
our board of directors then reviews whether our adviser has followed its established procedures for determinations of fair value  and votes whether to accept or reject the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
our adviser and our management recommended  and the board of directors voted to accept  the opinions of value delivered by spse on the loans in our portfolio as denoted on the consolidated schedule of investments as of september  and september   included in our consolidated financial statements 
because there is a delay between when we close an investment and when the investment can be evaluated by spse  new loans are not valued immediately by spse  rather  management makes its own determination about the value of these investments in accordance with our valuation policy 
because spse does not provide values for equity securities  our adviser determines the recommended fair value of these investments using valuation policies approved by our board of directors 
credit information our adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
we and our adviser participate in periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold control investments and generally require them to provide annual audited and interim unaudited financial statements 
using these statements and board discussions  our adviser calculates and evaluates the credit statistics 
loan grading and risk rating as part of our valuation procedures we risk rate all of our investments in debt securities 
for syndicated loans that have been rated by a nrsro as defined in rule a under the act  we use the nrsro s risk rating for such security 
for all other debt securities  we use a proprietary risk rating system 
our risk rating system uses a scale of to  with being the lowest probability of default 
this system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
these types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are used by banks and rating agencies 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold 
for the debt securities for which we do not use a third party nrsro risk rating  we seek to have our risk rating system mirror the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations  such as those provided by a nrsro 
while we seek to mirror the nrsro systems  we cannot provide any assurance that our risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as a nrsro for these securities 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of our risk rating system to the designations used by two nrsros as they risk rate debt securities of major companies 
because our system rates debt securities of companies that are unrated by any nrsro  there can be no assurance that the correlation to the nrsro set out below is accurate 
we believe our risk rating would be significantly higher than a typical nrsro risk rating because the risk rating of the typical nrsro is designed for larger businesses 
however  our risk rating has been designed to risk rate the securities of smaller businesses that are not rated by a typical nrsro 
therefore  when we use our risk rating on larger business securities  the risk rating is higher than a typical nrsro rating 
the primary difference between our risk rating and the rating of a typical nrsro is that our risk rating uses more quantitative determinants and includes qualitative determinants that we believe are not used in the nrsro rating 
it is our understanding that most debt securities of medium sized companies do not exceed the grade of bbb on a nrsro scale  so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of aaa  aa or a 
therefore  our scale begins with the designation as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a bbb from a nrsro  however  no assurance can be given that a on our scale is equal to a bbb on a nrsro scale 
company s system first nrsro second nrsro gladstone capital s description a baa bbb probability of default pd during the next ten years is and the expected loss el is or less baa bbb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa cc pd is and the el is to n a d pd is or there is a payment default and the el is greater than a the default rates set forth here are for a ten year term debt security 
if a debt security is less than ten years then the probability of default is adjusted to a lower percentage for the shorter period which may move the security higher on our risk rating scale 
the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
our policy is to stop accruing interest on an investment if we determine that interest is no longer collectible 
at september   one investment was on non accrual and at september   no payments were past due on any of our debt securities 
we do not risk rate our equity securities

we value debt securities that are not publicly traded  but for which a limited market for the security exists  such as certain participations in syndicated loans  at the indicative bid price offered by the syndication agent s trading desk on or near the valuation date

debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies where we have an equity  or equity like interest that are not publicly traded  for which there is no market  or for which there is a market but the securities have not been rated by a nrsro  are valued at cost  if there is adequate total enterprise value determined when valuing our equity holdings in the borrower 
fair values are discounted for any shortfall of total enterprise value over the total debt outstanding for the borrower 
securities that are not publicly traded and that are issued by portfolio companies for which there is no market  or for which there is a market or the securities have not been rated by a nrsro  we determine the value of the security as if we currently intended to sell the security and consider some or all of the following factors the risk rating of the security  the cost basis and the type of the security  the nature and realizable value of the collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and discounted cash flow  reports from portfolio company senior management and board meetings  reported values of similar securities of the portfolio company or comparable companies  and changes in the economy affecting the portfolio company 
we value convertible debt  equity  success or exit fees or other equity like securities for which there is a market based on the market prices for such securities  even if that market is not robust 
at september  and september   there was no market for any of the equity securities we owned 
to value convertible debt  equity  success or exit fee or other equity like securities for which no market exists  we use the same methodology we would use for securities described above  as well as standard valuation techniques used by major valuation firms to value the equity securities of private companies 
these valuation techniques also include discounted cash flow of the expected sale price in the future  valuation of the securities based on recent sales to third parties in comparable transactions  or a review of similar companies that are publicly traded and the market multiple of their equity securities 
in gathering the sales to third parties of similar securities  we may reference industry statistics and use outside experts

as a ric  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders 
to qualify as a ric  we are required to distribute to stockholders at least of our investment company taxable income  as defined by the code 
we have a policy to pay out as a dividend up to of that amount 
in an effort to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we currently intend to distribute during each calendar year  an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year and any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
revenue recognition interest income recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
we will stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
conditional interest or a success fee is recorded when earned upon full repayment of a loan investment 
paid in kind interest in the past  we have had some loans in our portfolio which contained a pik provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain our status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
services provided to portfolio companies as a business development company under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
we provide these services through our adviser  who provides these services on our behalf through its officers who are also our officers 
currently  neither we nor our adviser charges a fee for managerial assistance  however  if our adviser does receive fees for such managerial assistance  our adviser will credit the managerial assistance fees to the base management fee due from us to our adviser 
our adviser receives fees for the other services it provides to our portfolio companies

the interest rate charged on the advances under the db facility is based on the commercial paper cp rate  which is equivalent to the weighted average per annum rates paid by the db facility s cp lenders in respect of cp notes issued by the cp lender during such period 
business loan also has the ability to borrow at an alternative rate from the committed lenders if cp lenders are unable to fund advances 
the alternative rate is the london interbank offered rate libor  or if libor is unavailable  the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
as of september   the outstanding principal balance under this credit facility was approximately million at an interest rate of approximately plus a program fee 
available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed by deutsche bank ag  based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by business loan  which varies as loans are added and repaid  regardless of whether such repayments are early prepayment or are made as contractually required 
at september   the remaining borrowing capacity available under the db facility was approximately million 
in the event that we are not able to renew or refinance the db facility once it matures  this could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and ability to fund new investments 
the db facility contains covenants that require business loan to maintain its status as a separate entity  prohibit certain significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies 
the facility also restricts some of the terms and provisions including interest rates  terms to maturity and payments schedules and limits the borrower and industry concentrations of loans that are eligible to secure advances 
as of september   business loan was in compliance with all of the facility covenants 
we currently intend to securitize the loans held by business loan and if we are able to do so  we will use the proceeds from the securitization to pay down any amounts then outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the administrative agent also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with the bank of new york as custodian 
deutsche bank ag is also the trustee of the account and once a month remits the collected funds to us 
for the fiscal year ended september   the amount due from custodian decreased by  as compared to september  our adviser services the loans pledged under the db facility 
as a condition to this servicing arrangement  we executed a performance guaranty pursuant to which we guaranteed that our adviser would comply fully with all of its obligations under the facility 
the performance guaranty requires us to maintain a minimum net worth of million plus of equity issued after may and to maintain asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least  in accordance with section of the act 
as of september   we were in compliance with our covenants under the performance guaranty 
contractual obligations the following table shows our significant contractual obligations for the repayment of debt and payment of other contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years purchase obligations   total   the purchase obligations reflected in the above table represent commitments outstanding as of september  to fund six loan investments of which four  at a cost of million  were subsequently closed in october item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
while we expect that ultimately approximately of the loans in our portfolio will be made at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates  currently substantially all of our investment portfolio is at variable rates 
our portfolio has approximately of the total loan portfolio cost basis at variable rates with a floor  approximately of the total loan portfolio cost basis at a variable rate with a floor and ceiling  of the total loan portfolio cost basis at variable rates  and at fixed rates 
general interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities and  accordingly have a material adverse effect on our investment objectives and our rate of return on invested capital 
our variable based loans have rates associated with either the current prime rate or libor 
in addition  an increase in interest rates would make it more expensive to use debt for our financing needs  if any 
under the db facility  we have a million revolving line of credit facility  based on variable rates  with deutsche bank ag which matured in may and was extended and amended through may we expect to continue to borrow funds to finance future lending activities 
these future borrowings may be at fixed or variable rates 
for example  interest rates charged on the advances under our credit facility are based on the rate paid by the lenders on commercial paper notes issued by such lenders to fund some or all of the advances  libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate  depending on market conditions  and adjust periodically 
as of september   there was an outstanding principal balance of million under the db facility 
in february  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in order to fulfill an obligation under the initial terms of the db facility to enter into certain hedging transactions in connection with our borrowings under the line of credit 
we purchased this interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million for a one time  up front payment of  the interest rate cap agreement entitles us to receive payments  if any  equal to the amount by which interest payments on million at the point which one month libor exceed the payments on million at 
the cap expires in february this interest rate cap agreement effectively caps our interest payments on our line of credit borrowing  up to the notional amount of the interest rate cap  at five percent 
this mitigates our exposure to increases in interest rates on our borrowings on our lines of credit  which are at variable rates 
at september   the cap agreement had a fair market value of  and a current notional amount of million 
at september   the one month libor rate was approximately 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net increase in net assets resulting from operations  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond the interest rate cap agreement are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  a hypothetical increase in the one month libor or the prime rate by would increase our net increase in net assets resulting from operations by approximately million  or  over the next twelve months  compared to the net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the twelve months ended september  a hypothetical decrease in the one month libor or the prime rate by would decrease net increase in net assets resulting from operations by approximately million  or  over the next twelve months  compared to the net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the twelve months ended september  although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
in the event that we securitize a portion of our loan portfolio  we believe that we will likely be required to enter into further hedging arrangements in the future with respect to securitized loans 
while hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future  such as interest rate swap agreements  may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
we may also experience risk associated with investing in securities of companies with foreign operations 
we currently do not anticipate investing in debt or equity of foreign companies  however  some potential portfolio companies may have operations located outside the united states 
these risks include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  imposition of foreign taxes  changes in exportation regulations and political and social instability
