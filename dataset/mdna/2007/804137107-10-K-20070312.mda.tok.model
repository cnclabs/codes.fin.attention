sales in the european market increased slightly compared to due primarily to strengthening economic conditions  particularly in germany 
the asia pacific region contributes less than percent of the sales in the agriculture and turf care markets and therefore the decrease in the asia pacific region does not significantly impact the total market 
construction road building all regions experienced sales increases in the construction and road building markets during europe experienced the strongest growth at percent 
increases in europe are attributable to strengthening of the overall economy and strong export markets 
the percent increase in sales in the americas region is primarily driven by strengthening economic conditions in brazil as well as increased production of skid steer loaders and crawlers  particularly during the first half of the year 
the asia pacific market also benefited from the growth in the skid steer loader market  in addition to increased demand from the chinese transit mixer market 
the road building market in the asia pacific region showed strong increases  mainly due to china s increased focus on infrastructure spending 
material handling specialty specialty vehicles are comprised of a variety of markets including forestry  material handling  marine  waste management and waste recycling 
all regions contributed to the sales growth in the specialty markets 
growth in the aerial lift market continues to be the main contributor to the overall percent increase in sales in distribution products related to all of the above markets are sold to distributors  who then serve smaller oems

margin on total net sales decreased due to several factors  including labor costs for overtime worked to meet the high demand for product  costs to expedite product to meet customer demand  and costs for subcontract suppliers used to reduce the cost of production bottlenecks  primarily in the work function segment 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative costs in was due to the continuing development and implementation of a common business system to standardize business processes and provide a single interface to direct oem customers and suppliers

in the company recognized other income of million related to foreign currency gains on transactions 
the company recognized million of expense in due to foreign currency losses on transactions 
this fluctuation between years was primarily due to the significant weakening of the us dollar in late and the strengthening of the us dollar throughout operating results compared to sales growth by market the following table summarizes the company s sales growth by market 
the table and following discussion is on a comparable basis  which excludes the effects of currency fluctuations 
americas asia pacific europe total agriculture turf care construction road building material handling specialty distribution agriculture turf care the asia pacific region showed the greatest percentage of growth  however this is a relatively small market as it represents less than five percent of the company s sales in the agriculture and turf care markets 
the agriculture market in the americas was down overall  however  increased sales in the north american sprayer market offset reduced tractor production 
the consumer turf care market in the americas was level with  while demand in the commercial market was lower than in the agriculture market in europe was also down compared to resulting in reduced tractor sales 
construction road building the construction and road building markets were improved in the americas in the percent growth in the americas is primarily due to a strong market for skid steer loaders  however  sales also increased due to new sales of medium power hydrostatic products to a major oem in the percent growth in asia pacific is also due to strong markets for skid steer loaders and road roller products in north america as the oems are exporting product to the americas 
the transit mixer market drove the growth in the european market in  in addition to oems exporting product to the americas for the road building market 
material handling specialty a strong aerial lift market is contributing to the percent growth in the americas 
in europe several of the material handling markets experienced growth in including forklift  aerial lifts  and container handling equipment 
the forestry and marine markets have also contributed to the percent growth in the european specialty markets 
the sales growth in the asia pacific region is due to increased sales into the mining market  although asia pacific sales are a small percentage of the company s total sales in the specialty markets 
distribution products related to all of the above markets are sold to distributors  who then serve smaller oems 
order backlog the following table shows the company s order backlog and orders written activity for and  separately identifying the impact of currency fluctuations 
order backlog represents the amount of customer orders received for future shipment 
in millions currency fluctuation underlying increase decrease total backlog at december orders written total order backlog at the end of was million  compared to million at the end of on a comparable basis  excluding the impact of currency fluctuation  order backlog increased percent over new sales orders written for were  million  an increase of percent over  excluding the impact of currency fluctuations 
in recent years backlog information has become less reliable as an indicator of future sales levels as customers alter their sales order patterns 
the percent increase in orders written in is reflective of the strong sales experienced during the year and backlog remains strong at the end of the year with over million of customers orders received for future delivery 
business segment results the following table provides a summary of each segment s net sales and segment income  separately identifying the impact of currency fluctuations during the year 
in millions currency fluctuation underlying increase decrease net sales propel work function controls segment income loss propel work function controls global services and other expenses  net propel segment the propel segment experienced the strongest growth in  with a sales increase of percent excluding the effects of currency fluctuations 
consumers continue to move away from mechanical transmissions to hydrostatic transmissions in the turf care market  which has contributed to increased sales in the propel segment  although  as noted in the market section  the growth in the turf care market is beginning to level off 
the gross profit percentage of sales in the propel segment was consistent in with the percent achieved in segment income increased percent from  excluding the effects of currency fluctuations 
work function segment sales in the work function segment increased by percent  excluding the effect of currency fluctuations  in compared to similar to  demand for work function product has been high and has resulted in increased overtime costs and increased delivery costs to expedite shipments to meet customer demand which has had a negative impact on the gross margin 
in late the company established production capacity in the us for work function products that are sold in the us market 
this additional production capability is expected to reduce capacity constraints and freight costs in during the work function segment recognized million of field recall costs related to two separate quality issues 
in the income of the work function segment was negatively affected by million of restructuring costs  including the remaining costs to relocate the operations of the company s west branch  iowa facility that was started in controls segment net sales increased percent  excluding the effects of currency fluctuations  in compared to gross profit as a percent of sales was consistent with at percent 
segment income in increased percent compared to excluding the impact of currency fluctuations 
global services and other expenses  net expenses in global services increased in due to million of increased expenses related to the common business system 
this increased expense was partially off set by a million fluctuation in foreign currency gain loss and a million reduction in outside service costs to assess internal controls and related audit costs to test management s assessment of internal control under section of the sarbanes oxley act of total costs in related to the internal control assessment were million in  compared to million in as noted in the executive summary  the company recognized other income of million related to foreign currency gains on transactions in compared to million of losses on foreign currency exchange in  which is included in global services and other expenses

the benefit was partially offset by million of tax expense in the us related to the repatriation of previously undistributed earnings from a subsidiary in denmark  in connection with the american jobs creation act 
the rate also includes benefit of million for reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets were generated in prior years and no tax benefits were recognized at that time 
market risk the company is naturally exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency changes the company has operations and sells its products in many different countries of the world and therefore  conducts its business in various currencies 
the company s financial statements  which are presented in us dollars  can be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk 
translation risk is the risk that the financial statements of the company  for a particular period or as of a certain date  may be affected by changes in the exchange rates that are used to translate the financial statements of the company s operations from foreign currencies into us dollars 
transaction risk is the risk from the company receiving its sale proceeds or holding its assets in a currency different from that in which it pays its expenses and holds its liabilities 
in previous years  the company had been well balanced between its us and european operations because the company generated its sales in the same country in which it incurred its expenses  or shipped products between geographic regions on a balanced basis 
however  in recent years the balance has shifted and the amount of sales made in us dollars has increased  whereas the production costs are in a currency other than the us dollar  increasing the company s exposure to transaction risk 
in the company sold a total of million into the us of product that had been produced in european based currencies compared to sales into europe of million of product produced in us dollars 
this imbalance had a significant impact on the results of the company 
in the results were unfavorable as the dollar weakened in comparison to other currencies compared to the company produces and sells its product in several regions of the world  however the us and european transactions comprise the majority of the imbalance between regions 
in the company began to enter into forward contracts to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on cash flows related to forecasted sales denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the selling location 
the forecasted sales represent sales to both external and internal parties 
any effects of the forward contracts related to sales to internal parties are eliminated in the consolidation process until the related inventory has been sold to an external party 
the forward contracts qualify for hedge accounting and therefore are subject to effectiveness testing at the inception of the contract and throughout the life of the contract 
in as a result of hedge accounting for the forward contracts  the company recognized an increase to net sales of million and expense of million was recorded to offset gain on currency transactions 
the fair value of forward contracts included as an asset on the balance sheet at december  was million 
the company is also impacted by translation risk in terms of comparing results from period to period 
fluctuations of currencies against the us dollar can be substantial and therefore  significantly impact comparisons with prior periods 
the translation impact on making prior period comparisons with respect to the company s net sales can be material  although the impact has not been significant in either or translation affects the comparability of both the income statement and the balance sheet 
the change in the exchange rate does affect the comparability of the balance sheet between and as the balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rate as of december the us dollar weakened by percent against the euro and the danish kroner from december  to december  the weakening of the dollar has resulted in approximately percent of the company s total balance sheet being stated percent higher than the prior year since roughly percent of the company s total assets and liabilities are denominated in the euro or the danish kroner 
interest rate changes the company uses interest rate swap agreements on a limited basis to manage the interest rate risk on the total debt portfolio 
the company was a party to three interest rate swap agreements at december   with a combined notional amount of million euro  that require the company to pay interest at a fixed rate and receive interest at a variable rate 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is recorded as a liability of million on the balance sheet at december   with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as the derivatives are accounted for using hedge accounting 
the interest rate swap agreements mature at various dates through march the following table summarizes the maturity of the company s debt obligations for fixed and variable rate debt amounts in millions fixed rate debt variable rate debt and thereafter total includes total principal repayments of million on variable rate debt 
the rate has been fixed through the use of interest rate swaps 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations and from its various credit facilities 
the company historically has accessed diverse funding sources  including short and long term unsecured bank lines of credit in the united states  europe  and asia  as well as the private debt markets in the united states as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects to have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its future funding needs due to the multiple funding sources that have been  and continue to be  available to the company 
the multicurrency revolving credit facility  as modified in july  provides up to million of unsecured credit through december  as well as million euro term loan which expires in july at december  the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the company is required to meet certain financial covenants under this facility as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company was in compliance with the covenants at december  and is not aware of any circumstances currently that would impact compliance during the next twelve months 
cash flows from operations cash provided by operations was million in the company invested an additional million  excluding the effect of currency  in inventories in in order to meet the anticipated increase in demand for product in early in addition  a large increase in receivables of million contributed to a use of cash due to the higher level of sales in the fourth quarter 
these increases were offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  primarily due to the increase in inventory 
total cash of the company increased million from december  to december  at december  cash balances in china totaled million  an increase of million from december  the company is paying dividends from its chinese entities to the maximum extent possible under current regulations  however  due to the nature of the governmental and other regulatory controls  it is difficult to move cash out of china for reasons other than payment for goods shipped into that country 
as the company continues to consider expanding its manufacturing capabilities in low cost regions  it will make every effort to utilize the cash balances in those regions to fund future expansions 
total cash outside of china increased by million in cash used in investing activities capital expenditures for totaled million 
capital expenditures were high in all business segments and were primarily related to the addition of production capacity in order to meet anticipated future demand levels 
cash used in financing activities the company continues to pay dividends to stockholders on a quarterly basis with million of cash used to pay dividends in in addition  the company periodically makes distributions to its minority interest partners from its various joint venture activities with distributions totaling million in the distributions can vary from year to year depending on the amount of undistributed earnings of the businesses and the needs of the partners 
the company borrowed an additional million  net  in  and paid million of fees related to the modification of its multicurrency revolving credit facility discussed above in liquidity and capital resources 
contractual cash obligations the majority of the company s contractual obligations to make cash payments to third parties are for financing obligations 
these include future lease payments under both operating and capital leases 
the following table discloses the company s future commitments under contractual obligations as of december  and contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt  capital leases operating leases rental and service agreemnts with related party danfoss a s total contractual cash obligations the following assumptions are used in the calculation of the contractual cash obligations the annual amount borrowed under revolving credit agreements does not change from the million borrowed at december   through the maturity date of the agreements 
the margin rate on variable interest rate debt does not change from december  the base interest rate for future years is based on the interest yield curves as of december  commitments denominated in a currency other than the us dollar are translated at the december  exchange rate 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  the company has certain other funding needs that are non contractual by nature  including funding of certain pension plans 
in the company anticipates contributing million to its us and us pension and health benefit plans 
although the company has not funded the german pension plan in the past  it is discussing funding options and may partially fund the pension liabilities in other matters critical accounting estimates the sec s guidance surrounding the disclosure of critical accounting estimates requires disclosures about estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies 
however  such discussion is limited to critical accounting estimates  or those that management believes meet two criteria the accounting estimate must require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
besides the estimates that meet the two criteria for a critical estimate above  the company makes many other accounting estimates in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on experience and information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  including estimates not deemed critical under the sec s guidance 
the discussion below should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  uncertainties  contingencies  and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f the development and selection of accounting estimates  including those deemed critical  and the associated disclosures in this discussion  have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventory valuation as a manufacturer in the capital goods industry  inventory is a substantial portion of the assets of the company  amounting to over percent of total assets at december  the company must periodically evaluate the carrying value of its inventory to assess the proper valuation 
this includes recording period adjustments as needed to record expenses due to excess capacity  provide for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a quarterly basis  management within each segment performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify the need for appropriate write downs to cover each of these items 
in doing so  management applies consistent practices based upon historical data such as actual loss experience  past and projected usage  actual margins generated from trade sales of its products  and finally its best judgment to estimate the appropriate carrying value of the inventory 
warranty provisions the company warrants its various products over differing periods depending upon the type of product and application 
consequently  the company records liabilities for the estimated warranty costs that may be incurred under its basic warranty based on past trends of actual warranty claims compared to the actual sales levels to which those claims apply 
these liabilities are accrued at the time the sales of the products are recorded 
factors that affect the company s warranty liability include the number of units in the field currently under warranty  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on those units and the cost per claim to satisfy the company s warranty obligation 
the anticipated rate of warranty claims is the primary factor impacting the company s estimated warranty obligation 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
in addition to its normal warranty liability  the company  from time to time in the normal course of business  incurs costs to repair or replace defective products with a specific customer or group of customers 
the company refers to these as field recalls and in these instances  the company will record a specific provision for the expected costs it will incur to repair or replace these products utilizing information from customers and internal information regarding the specific cost of materials and labor 
typically  field recalls are infrequent in occurrence  however  when they occur  field recalls can be for a large number of units and quite costly to rectify 
because of the sporadic and infrequent nature of field recalls  and due to the extreme range of costs associated with field recalls  the company cannot accurately estimate these costs at the time the products are sold 
therefore  these costs are recorded at the time information becomes known to the company 
as the field recalls are settled  the company relieves the specific liability related to that field recall 
these specific field recall liabilities are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
long lived asset recovery a significant portion of the company s total assets consist of property  plant and equipment pp e and definite life intangibles  as well as goodwill 
changes in technology or in the company s intended use of these assets  as well as changes in the broad global economy in which the company operates  may cause the estimated period of use or the carrying value of these assets to change 
this requires the company to periodically assess the estimated useful lives of its assets in order to match  through depreciation and amortization  the cost of those assets with the benefits derived over the period of usefulness 
the useful lives of these assets can be shortened through greater use due to volume increases  rapidly changing technology such as the use of electronics and computer operated controls  and through inadequate maintenance 
despite management s best efforts to determine the appropriate useful lives of its equipment  certain situations may arise that lead to an asset or group of assets becoming impaired  meaning their economic value becomes less than the value at which the company is carrying the asset on its books 
examples of these situations are product rationalization efforts or restructuring of manufacturing facilities 
when these situations arise  the company tests the assets for impairment and will write down the asset in the period when the impairment becomes known 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
as of december  a ten percent change in the depreciable lives of the company s assets would impact depreciation expense by approximately million 
valuation of trade receivables the company records trade receivables due from its customers at the time a sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policy 
the future collectibility of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it believes may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables  looking at the historical losses incurred as a percentage of net sales  and by monitoring the financial strength of its customers 
in addition  local customary practices have to be taken into account due to varying payment terms being applied in various parts of the world where the company conducts its business 
if the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  where it has filed for bankruptcy  the company establishes a specific allowance for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of trade receivables is performed quarterly 
workers compensation the company has an insurance policy to cover workers compensation claims in the united states  in which the company pays the first million per claim  per incident 
the company establishes its workers compensation reserve based on historic growth factors of claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported claims 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
us health care costs the company self insures its us health care costs for eligible employees and their qualified dependents with exposure for any one year  excluding prescription costs  limited to million per individual 
the company establishes reserves for its health care cost based on historic claims data and an estimate of incurred  but not reported claims 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a portion of its employees 
in certain countries  such as the united states and the united kingdom  these plans are funded with plan assets whereas in other countries such as germany  the plans are completely unfunded  which is customary 
the measurement of the company s pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by the company s actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and other experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates the company bases the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at or near year end on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  investment strategy  and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience and standard industry actuarial tables  respectively 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in such future periods 
the company s funding policy for the us plans are to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
in the company anticipates contributing million to its us plans and million to its uk plans 
postretirement benefits other than pensions the company provides postretirement health care benefits for certain employee groups in the united states 
this plan is contributory and contains certain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the company does not pre fund this plan and has the right to modify or terminate this plan in the future 
the postretirement liability  which is determined on an actuarial basis  is recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheets and the postretirement expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the company must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at investment yield trends available near year end on corporate bonds rated aa 
in addition  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for the health care cost trend rate used in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the subsequent year 
as of december  a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would impact the expense recognized in by million and would affect the post retirement benefit obligation by million 
in the company anticipates contributing million to this plan 
deferred income taxes tax regulations may require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on a tax return  and some of the differences are temporary such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally are attributable to items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years but the amount has already been included as an expense in the financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions that have been taken on the tax return but have not been recognized as expense in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized
