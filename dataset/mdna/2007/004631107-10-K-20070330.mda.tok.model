item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since we reached a high of eleven television stations in  we have been seeking to monetize shareholder value by the selective sale of our stations 
we continue to more likely be sellers rather than buyers of television station assets 
in march  we sold two of our stations  kplr tv serving the st 
louis marketplace and kwbp tv  serving the portland  oregon marketplace  to subsidiaries of the tribune company for an aggregate  all cash  consideration of million plus a payment for the closing date working capital of the st 
louis station in the amount of approximately million 
in april  we sold our station kuwb tv serving the salt lake city marketplace to subsidiaries of clear channel communications  inc for an all cash consideration of million 
in may  we entered into an agreement to sell our ft 
myers naples station  wtvk tv  to sun broadcasting  inc for an all cash consideration of million 
we completed the wtvk tv transaction on february  the results relating to these four stations have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our continuing stations are regionally diverse and range in market size based on television households from the th through the th largest in the nation 
all but one of our stations are affiliates of the cw television network 
our second station in the albuquerque santa fe marketplace is an affiliate of mynetworktv 
our continuing stations have only been on the air  or achieving measurable ratings  for years 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  regional and national advertisers and  through july  the date we deconsolidated the venture  from program licensing fees related to the daily buzz 
our advertising revenues depend on popular programming that attracts audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  allowing us to sell advertising time at satisfactory rates 
similar to all commercial television stations  our rates are directly affected by the number of and demographic makeup of our viewing audience  as measured by nielsen media research 
our revenues also depend significantly on factors such as the national and local economy and the level of local competition 
approximately of our revenues are derived from programming that airs between the hours of pm to midnight  monday through sunday 
network prime time  which is a subset of this daypart  accounts for of our total revenues 
our continuing stations average broadcast season mid september to mid september ratings among adults viewers ages in this pm to midnight daypart  based on the average of the three major sweeps ratings periods november  february and may of each broadcast season  grew steadily until the season  when our weighted average rating fell to a from the previous season s rating 
our weighted average rating for the season declined again to our weighted average rating for the season  the last season for the wb and for upn  held steady from the previous season at a our loss in in market viewing shares for this same time period and demographic was less severe than our broadcast competitors who  as a group  also experienced rating declines 
we believe that the ratings declines for the periods through the season  while not limited to our prime time daypart  were attributable mostly to the decline in the wb network s prime time ratings and the impact that such a drop  in our highest viewed daypart  had upon the surrounding dayparts 
the cw network  which succeeded the wb and upn networks  launched in september six of our seven continuing stations are affiliated with the cw 
most industry analysts believed  as did we  that the cw network would launch to better numbers than the wb network and upn enjoyed the prior season  but it did not 
in the november sweeps  our weighted average ratings for our continuing stations in this pm midnight period among adult viewers ages decreased from the november ratings period 
on a broader  composite demographic basis for the same time period  however  our share of viewers relative to our local commercial in market competitors actually increased during the november sweeps by compared to our november sweeps results 
our stations are generally ranked fifth or in the case of our second station in the albuquerque santa fe market  sixth amongst commercial television stations in their respective markets in terms of either their share of viewers or their share of the market s broadcast television revenue 
in periods of lower advertising demand as has been the case for much of the past three years competition from market leaders  generally the abc  cbs  nbc and fox affiliated stations  increases as these stations become more aggressive in their pricing to maintain their revenue share 
over the past several years  biennial political spending in the even years has grown substantially 
while we do not directly benefit from this political advertising since most such advertising generally targets viewers older than our normal viewing audience  we indirectly benefit as the increased demand for political advertising reduces the overall inventory available to non political advertisers in each market  which consequently increases the overall advertising price for such non political advertisers 
we expect that the broadcast season should see strong competition from the market leader stations as they seek to minimize the reduction in revenue in compared to higher revenues inflated by strong political advertising revenue 
similar to the television advertising business in general  our revenues are usually greatest during the fourth quarter of each year  primarily due to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season consumer spending and an increase in viewership during this period 
we generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising and to national sales representatives on national advertising 
our net revenues reflect deductions from gross revenues for commissions payable to advertising agencies and national sales representatives 
our primary ongoing operating expenses are costs of services  selling  general and administrative expenses  corporate expenses  depreciation and amortization and expenses related to impairments in our broadcast licenses 
costs of services include programming costs  which consist primarily of amortization of broadcast rights relating to syndicated programs as well as costs associated with our morning news show  the daily buzz which  as of january   became jointly produced by us and emmis and then  beginning july  was deconsolidated and music rights fees 
other costs of service include advertising expenses targeted at viewers  which is net of any reimbursement received or due to us for such advertising and promotion from our networks or from other program suppliers  and engineering and transmission related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries  sales commissions to account executives  ratings service expenses  insurance and various related overhead expenses 
corporate expenses reflect costs of corporate management  which includes senior management and other centralized management support staff  along with investor relations expenses  professional fees  directors and officers insurance and other related corporate overhead 
in the fall of  we began to experience a noticeable slowdown in non political advertiser demand 
by december  it was clear that there was a dramatic weakness in demand affecting all media related companies and there were broader indications that the us economy was in a slowdown 
this weak demand continued through all of  and the resultant effect of the events of september  only made a tough year worse 
by industry accounts  television revenues declined approximately compared to  the steepest decline in the last years 
nearly every publicly traded television broadcaster  including us  posted year over year declines in advertising revenues 
advertising demand began to rebound early in and non political advertising for that year was up over levels in our continuing stations markets 
in march  operation freedom commenced in iraq and advertising demand was adversely affected for several weeks  but despite that disruption  non political advertising revenues in for our continuing station markets grew a respectable over levels 
while most expected that the calendar year would reflect an improved operating environment compared to  despite record breaking political advertising  non political advertising revenues were essentially unchanged from levels 
in  non political local advertising demand was very solid  averaging an annual increase compared to of in our continuing markets 
national advertising  however  was very weak  and actually declined compared to in our continuing markets despite the record political spending in  which increased the non political advertising rates due to decreased inventory for such ads 
in  strong political advertising drove overall market revenue growth by over the prior year in our markets 
however  we did not participate meaningfully in political revenues  and non political advertising revenues for remained unchanged from levels 
we do not believe that non political revenues in our marketplaces will increase more than and we believe in the first quarter of non political revenues are actually down compared to the first quarter of which will make it difficult for us to grow our revenues in apart from any ratings gains we may experience from the cw network 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  in  net revenues from continuing operations increased to million from million in our station group achieved a increase in net revenues as overall viewership levels among our key demographics grew just slightly during the calendar year 
while there was robust political advertising in our markets  we did not attract much of that incremental spending  and the non political advertising revenues in our markets were unchanged compared to levels 
effective july   we deconsolidated the daily buzz  llc as we ceased to be the primary beneficiary of the venture 
accordingly  we had only six months of that revenue in compared to a full year of revenues for the daily buzz in  and net revenues for the daily buzz in our consolidated results declined 
effective march   we became the sole owner of the daily buzz  llc and will begin including its results in our consolidated results of operations 
programming expenses for decreased by to million compared to million in programming expenses for this decrease was due primarily to the deconsolidation of the daily buzz effective july  the year includes only six months of expense related to the show and this accounts for most of the decline in programming costs compared to and a decline in music license fees  net of a  increase in write downs of program license rights to adjust to net realizable value 
other costs of services for increased to million from million in  principally due to higher promotion expenses to launch the cw network in the fall of selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million compared to million in primarily due to stock based compensation expense of  recognized in in accordance with sfas r and higher property related expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million compared to million for this decrease relates primarily to more assets reaching full depreciation than those being added during the latter part of and we wrote off  and  in and  respectively  in costs associated with our efforts to secure construction permits for television stations in the lexington  kentucky and richmond  virginia markets as we determined that such permits were not likely to be issued by the fcc due to short spacing signal issues 
impairment of broadcast licenses for was  compared to an impairment expense of million in both impairment charges reflected lower valuations for certain of our stations fcc licenses 
corporate expenses for decreased to million from million in principally due to lower professional fees due to lower costs associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act since we became a non accelerated filer in december we incurred income tax expense of million in compared to income tax expense of  in the income tax expense in both years primarily relate to deferred tax liabilities associated with amortization of intangibles for tax purposes in excess of impairment write downs for book purposes 
the tax expense was significantly lower in due to the million impairment of broadcast licenses in our income from discontinued operations in was approximately million before tax expense of  compared to a pre tax loss of million in the income in includes a million gain on the sale of our salt lake city station  million in additional proceeds from the buyer of our st 
louis stations due to their usage of that station s tax net operating losses tax nols  net of operating income of million and interest expense of million 
the loss includes million operating losses and million in interest  net of million in additional consideration for the buyer s usage of our st 
louis station s tax nols 
the operating losses of our discontinued operations were favorably impacted by improved operating results at our ft 
myers naples station and the sale of our salt lake city station  which was not profitable  in april year ended december  compared to year ended december  in our net revenues increased to million from million in this increase was driven by a  or million  increase in net revenues for our the daily buzz venture compared to  net of a decrease in net revenues at our stations on lower ratings and revenue shares 
programming expenses increased to million compared to the prior year s programming expense of million 
this increase was attributable primarily to our continued investment in programming  including malcolm in the middle which launched in syndication in september at four of our stations  a increase in our the daily buzz production costs largely driven by increased news costs related to our increased licensing revenue and a year over year increase of  in the write downs of program rights to adjust to net realizable value 
other costs of services increased to million compared to a prior year expense of million 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased utilities and operating lease expenses relating to the roll out of digital transmissions at several of our stations during the last half of selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased to million compared to million in due to lower sales and traffic system software installation expenses and lower compensation expense due to unfilled sales department vacancies 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million compared to million for as continued capital expenditures to convert to hdtv was mostly offset by assets becoming fully depreciated during the year 
we wrote off  and million in and  respectively  in costs associated with our efforts to secure construction permits for television stations in the lexington  kentucky and richmond  virginia markets as we determined that such permits were not likely to be issued by the fcc due to short spacing signal issues 
impairment of broadcast licenses for was million compared to an impairment expense of million in both impairment charges reflected lower valuations for certain of our stations fcc licenses 
corporate expenses for decreased to million from million in this decrease in corporate expenses was primarily due to lower costs related to our second year implementation of our internal controls procedures and documentation to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we incurred income tax expense of  million in compared to income tax expense of million in the income tax expense in both years primarily relate to deferred tax liabilities associated with amortization of intangibles for tax purposes 
our loss from discontinued operations in was approximately million compared to a loss of million in these losses are comprised of operating losses at our stations in salt lake city and ft 
myers naples and interest expense  which is being totally allocated to discontinued operations because the proceeds from the sale of these two stations exceeds the outstanding debt and is required to be used to repay that debt 
our station operating losses in were less than in due to improved results at our ft 
myers naples station and due to our salt lake city losses being shared by clear channel effective august in connection with their purchase of the station 
in addition  the loss is net of million in additional consideration received from tribune in connection with its use of tax net operating losses from the tribune transaction 
liquidity and capital resources prior to  we carried a high level of debt arising from the issuance of our television notes and intermediate notes in september largely due to our desire to significantly reduce our debt levels  we sold our biggest stations ie  st 
louis and portland  oregon to tribune in march  and during we redeemed substantially all of our long term debt  including both our television notes and our intermediate notes 
in november  we amended our senior credit facility and simultaneously completed a new million second lien term loan facility sltl 
the senior credit facility was amended to increase the maximum borrowings thereunder to million  reduce the borrowing rates  provide us the ability to repurchase up to million of our common stock  extend the maturity date to november and amend and eliminate certain of our financial covenants 
the sltl matures in may  and bears interest at libor plus  with interest payable quarterly 
the financial covenants in both agreements are limited to a quarterly tests for minimum trailing twelve month ebitda  b an annual test for maximum capital expenditures and c a covenant that the combined outstanding borrowings under both the senior credit facility and the sltl facility will not exceed of the company s most recent lender approved appraised valuation of our stations 
on march  we amended our senior credit facility to eliminate all financial covenants effective december   extend the term until may  change the borrowing rates  increase the amount of our stock we can repurchase up to million and to allow borrowings under the facility or from future station sales to repay the sltl 
in april  we repaid and terminated the sltl 
on december   the borrowings outstanding under our senior credit agreement were million at a weighted average annual interest rate and we were in compliance with all of the agreement s terms  conditions and covenants 
the senior credit facility  as amended  allows for borrowings up to a maximum of the lower of million or a percentage of our stations aggregate appraised stac start up station with an affiliation contract sold on compressed time frames values  which are lower than the fair value of our station group 
the percentage advance rate is based on our continuing stations and declines to if we ever sell down to three or fewer stations 
our interest rates on borrowing is based on the advance rate  and is over libor at the advance rate and over libor at the lowest   advance rate 
we amended our senior credit facility on february  to allow us to pay dividends to our stockholders from any proceeds of station sales in excess of then outstanding borrowings or from new borrowings under the credit agreement of up to million 
on february   we completed the sun transaction and used the majority of the proceeds from that sale to repay all of the then outstanding debt and accrued interest under our senior credit facility of million 
our availability under the revolver  immediately following the closing and net of approximately  associated with lender reserves for projected six month cash interest payments  was approximately million 
that same day we declared a dividend per common share that was paid on march  to holders of record at the close of business on february  the aggregate dividend was million and we used approximately million of the remaining proceeds from the sun transaction along with approximately million in new borrowings under the senior credit facility to make that dividend payment 
we expect that we will need to borrow during the coming year to help fund capital expenditures estimated to be approximately million in calendar although our amended senior credit facility contains no financial covenants  it does contain a provision that upon the occurrence of an event or condition that has a material adverse change on our business a mac  the lenders can refuse to make additional advances under the facility 
accordingly  if a mac occurs in the future  we might not have access to funds under our senior credit facility which may be necessary for us to meet our obligations  including cash interest payable to the lenders  as they become due 
if we fail to meet such obligations as they become due  the lenders could claim a default and accelerate all amounts due under the senior credit facility 
net cash used in operating activities was  for compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for this decrease in use of cash of million was primarily due to reduced cash based operating losses  including lower corporate expenses  reduced programming payments for our construction permit markets and reduced working capital usage 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for which included million in net proceeds from the sale of our salt lake city station  million in additional consideration from tribune on their use of station kplr s tax nols and million in net proceeds from the sale of our interest in carsoup 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for  which included million in additional consideration from tribune related to their use of station kplr s tax nols and million in proceeds from the sale of our flint construction permit 
our capital expenditures for and were  and million  respectively on reduced hdtv related projects 
net cash used in financing activities during was million  which relates primarily to the repayment of our debt from the proceeds of the sale of our salt lake city station 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million which consisted of approximately million in borrowings and  in cash contributions from our minority interest partner in the daily buzz 
in our discontinued operations  net cash used in operating activities in was approximately million compared to million used in operating activities for because the sum of the expected net proceeds from the sun transaction and the actual net proceeds from the clear channel transaction exceeded our outstanding borrowings for and and the loan agreements in place at the time required us to repay outstanding debt first with those proceeds  all interest expense has been attributed to discontinued operations 
the reduced cash used in operating activities reflects the combined effect of improved profits at our ft 
myers naples station  reduced losses at our salt lake city station  which was sold in april  and reduced working capital usage 
net cash used in investing activities in our discontinued operations was  in compared to  used in investing activities in on reduced capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities in our discontinued operations was million in compared to  used in the  increase relates primarily to increased prepaid financing fees paid in connection with the march amendment of our revolver and second lien term loan agreements 
at december   amounts due under all capital lease facilities totaled  bearing an implicit average interest rate of per annum 
we expect to incur approximately million in additional miscellaneous capital expenditures in  an increase over our expenditures  as we are replacing the commercial playback systems at six of our seven continuing stations in one station s commercial playback systems was replaced in 
at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and negative working capital of million  including the million note payable under our revolving credit agreement classified as a current liability in connection with the sale of our ft 
myers naples station 
apart from any proceeds that might be generated as a result of station sales  it will be necessary for us to continue to borrow under our senior credit facility as the cash generated from our station operations will not offset our projected capital expenditures  cash corporate expenses and cash interest costs during at least the next twelve months 
we do not believe it is likely that the fcc will grant the construction permit applications in either lexington or richmond  but if they were to be granted  the license acquisition for lexington could be funded  under certain conditions  through our revolving credit facility 
our senior credit facility requires lender approval for any station acquisitions 
since our new credit facility has no operating performance covenants  we believe we have reduced our exposure to risk resulting from an economic downturn 
such a downturn  however  could still adversely affect our business and result in an increase in our borrowing needs and a possible reduction in our stac values and  therefore  debt capacity 
if our maximum borrowings allowed were to be reduced to an amount below our outstanding borrowings  we would be forced to amend our loan agreement  find alternative financing or sell station assets 
contractual cash obligations our contractual cash obligations by year of payment  in thousands  including the repayment of our revolving credit facility and our sltl  are as follows year senior credit facility program rights obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations thereafter    total      amount shown as being repaid in due to february  completion of the sun transaction 
includes commitments not recognized in our consolidated financial statements  as the underlying programming is not yet available for broadcast 
excludes obligations of discontinued operations as these have been or will be assumed by the buyers of the discontinued operations 
includes audience measurement service agreements  news service licenses  music license fees and various software license agreements 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we expect that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to broadcast rights  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we record revenue from the sale of airtime related to advertising and contracted time at the time of broadcast 
revenue and expenses associated with barter agreements in which broadcast time is exchanged for programming rights are recorded at the estimated average rate of the airtime exchanged 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we utilize information available to us  including the timing of payments and the financial condition of our customers  to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we do not have a significant concentration of accounts receivable from any single customer or industry segment 
programming rights our programming rights are stated  on a gross basis  at the lower of amortized cost or estimated realizable value 
we evaluate estimated realizable value of programming rights based on current usage and revenue performance and projected future revenue and usage of such programs 
changes in our programming schedule could impact the estimated realizable value of programming 
in addition  estimates of future revenue performance relate to the number of advertising spots we sell and the amount generated from such sales 
a decrease in the number of spots sold or the amount for such sales could also impact our estimated realizable value 
during  and  we recorded write downs of program rights due to impairments for our continuing stations of   and  respectively 
the increase in the write down was due primarily to write downs related to malcolm in the middle and  to a lesser extent  the drew carey show in two of our markets 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill 
sfas no 
 business combinations  requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
also specifies criteria that must be met before intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination can be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
the company re evaluated its reporting units effective december  and determined that the appropriate level to test goodwill for impairment should be at the market level 
previously  the company evaluated its goodwill on a consolidated basis 
based on the company s evaluations of goodwill including goodwill relating to discontinued operations at december   december  and december   there was no impairment of goodwill 
in connection with the adoption with sfas no 
 the company determined that its intangible assets broadcast licenses have an indefinite life 
accordingly  the company is required to test these intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of statement and did not amortize these intangibles beginning january  the company evaluates broadcast licenses on a station by station basis  except for its two stations serving the albuquerque santa fe  new mexico marketplace  which are evaluated together 
based upon evaluations  the company determined that due primarily to a decline in market conditions at certain stations  certain of its broadcast licenses had become impaired and a  million and million impairment expense was recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these impairments resulted from the carrying value of the broadcast licenses exceeding their fair values and are included in accumulated amortization 
impairment of long lived asset values the carrying values of our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impairment analysis is based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the stations 
based on these estimates  other than the write down on programming rights and broadcast licenses as disclosed above  we do not have any other impairment related to long lived assets for  or future adverse changes in market conditions  changes in technology and other factors could reduce the expected future cash flows and result in an impairment charge 
impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires us to expense the fair value of grants of various stock based compensation programs over the vesting period of the awards 
we elected to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective application transition method which does not result in the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements 
for additional information regarding our accounting under sfas r  see note stock option compensation in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no

 accounting for income taxes fas 
fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have any material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows  however 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   the year beginning january  for the company 
the company is still in the process of evaluating the requirements of sfas and has not yet determined the impact  if any  on the company s consolidated financial statements

 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas 
sfas requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a benefit postretirement plan in the statement of financial position  as well as recognition of changes in that funded status through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 
sfas also requires a change in the measurement of a plan s assets and benefit obligations as of the end date of the employer s fiscal year 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december   except for the measurement date provisions  which are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted sfas no 
for the year ended december   but since the company has never had any defined benefit plans or unfunded liabilities  the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the sec staff believes registrants must quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for the first annual period ending after november  with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sab as of december  had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
which is effective the first fiscal year that begins after november  sfas permits us to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt sfas effective january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our senior credit facility has variable interest rates 
accordingly  our interest expense could be materially affected by future fluctuations in the applicable interest rate 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million at an average interest rate of per annum 
based on the outstanding indebtedness as of december   a one percent change in our borrowing rates would change our annual interest expense by approximately
